We shrunk the dimensions of this technology from the micron scale to the true nanoscale.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, a set of tiny pillars separated by nanoscopic gaps are arranged in such a way that the system divides the fluid into streamlines, with the larger cancer-related nanoparticles being separated through a process of redirection from the smaller, healthier ones, which can in contrast move around the pillars in a zigzag-type motion in the direction of fluid flow.
The net result is a complete separation of these two particle populations.
You can visualize this separation process similar to traffic on a highway that separates into two roads, with one road going into a low-clearance tunnel under a mountain, and the other road going around it.
Here, smaller cars can go through the tunnel while larger trucks, carrying potentially hazardous material, are forced to take the detour route.
Traffic is effectively separated by size and contents without impeding its flow.
And this is exactly how our system works on a much, much smaller scale.
The idea here is that the separation process for screening could be as simple as processing a sample of urine, blood or saliva, which is a near-term possibility within the next few years.
Ultimately, it could be used to isolate and detect target exosomes associated with a particular type of cancer, sensing and reporting their presence within minutes.
This would make rapid diagnostics virtually painless.
Broadly speaking, the ability to separate and enrich biomarkers with nanoscale precision in an automated way, opens the door to better understanding diseases such as cancer, with applications ranging from sample preparation to diagnostics, and from drug resistance monitoring to therapeutics.
Even before my wife's bout with cancer, it was a dream of mine to facilitate the automation of this process -- to make regular screening more accessible, similar to the way Henry Ford made the automobile accessible to the general population through development of the assembly line.
Automation is the key to accessibility.
And in the spirit of the Hoover dream, "a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage," we're developing a technology that could ultimately place an early-warning cancer detection system in every home.
This would allow every man, woman and child the opportunity to be regularly tested while they're still healthy, catching cancer when it first emerges.
It is my hope and dream to help people around the world avoid the high costs -- physical, financial and emotional -- faced by today's cancer patients, hardships that I'm well acquainted with.
I'm also happy to report that because we caught my wife's cancer early, her treatment was successful, and she is now, thankfully, cancer-free.
(Applause)
It is an outcome that I would like to see for everyone with a cancer diagnosis.
With the work that my team has already done on separation of nanoscale biomarkers for rapid, early-stage cancer diagnostics, I am optimistic that within the next decade, this type of technology will be available, helping protect our friends, our family and future generations.
Even if we are so unlucky as to be diagnosed with cancer, that early-stage alarm will provide a strong beacon of hope.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The last time I heard my son's voice was when he walked out the front door on his way to school.
He called out one word in the darkness: "Bye."
It was April 20, 1999.
Later that morning, at Columbine High School, my son Dylan and his friend Eric killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded more than 20 others before taking their own lives.
Thirteen innocent people were killed, leaving their loved ones in a state of grief and trauma.
Others sustained injuries, some resulting in disfigurement and permanent disability.
But the enormity of the tragedy can't be measured only by the number of deaths and injuries that took place.
There's no way to quantify the psychological damage of those who were in the school, or who took part in rescue or cleanup efforts.
There's no way to assess the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine, especially when it can be a blueprint for other shooters who go on to commit atrocities of their own.
Columbine was a tidal wave, and when the crash ended, it would take years for the community and for society to comprehend its impact.
It has taken me years to try to accept my son's legacy.
The cruel behavior that defined the end of his life showed me that he was a completely different person from the one I knew.
Afterwards people asked, "How could you not know?
What kind of a mother were you?" I still ask myself those same questions.
Before the shootings, I thought of myself as a good mom.
Helping my children become caring, healthy, responsible adults was the most important role of my life.
But the tragedy convinced me that I failed as a parent, and it's partially this sense of failure that brings me here today.
Aside from his father, I was the one person who knew and loved Dylan the most.
If anyone could have known what was happening, it should have been me, right?
But I didn't know.
Today, I'm here to share the experience of what it's like to be the mother of someone who kills and hurts.
For years after the tragedy, I combed through memories, trying to figure out exactly where I failed as a parent.
But there are no simple answers.
I can't give you any solutions.
All I can do is share what I have learned.
When I talk to people who didn't know me before the shootings, I have three challenges to meet.
First, when I walk into a room like this, I never know if someone there has experienced loss because of what my son did.
I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering caused by a member of my family who isn't here to do it for himself.
So first, with all of my heart, I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain.
The second challenge I have is that I must ask for understanding and even compassion when I talk about my son's death as a suicide.
Two years before he died, he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook that he was cutting himself.
He said that he was in agony and wanted to get a gun so he could end his life.
I didn't know about any of this until months after his death.
When I talk about his death as a suicide, I'm not trying to downplay the viciousness he showed at the end of his life.
I'm trying to understand how his suicidal thinking led to murder.
After a lot of reading and talking with experts, I have come to believe that his involvement in the shootings was rooted not in his desire to kill but in his desire to die.
The third challenge I have when I talk about my son's murder-suicide is that I'm talking about mental health -- excuse me -- is that I'm talking about mental health, or brain health, as I prefer to call it, because it's more concrete.
And in the same breath, I'm talking about violence.
The last thing I want to do is to contribute to the misunderstanding that already exists around mental illness.
Only a very small percent of those who have a mental illness are violent toward other people, but of those who die by suicide, it's estimated that about 75 to maybe more than 90 percent have a diagnosable mental health condition of some kind.
As you all know very well, our mental health care system is not equipped to help everyone, and not everyone with destructive thoughts fits the criteria for a specific diagnosis.
Many who have ongoing feelings of fear or anger or hopelessness are never assessed or treated.
Too often, they get our attention only if they reach a behavioral crisis.
If estimates are correct that about one to two percent of all suicides involves the murder of another person, when suicide rates rise, as they are rising for some populations, the murder-suicide rates will rise as well.
I wanted to understand what was going on in Dylan's mind prior to his death, so I looked for answers from other survivors of suicide loss.
I did research and volunteered to help with fund-raising events, and whenever I could, I talked with those who had survived their own suicidal crisis or attempt.
One of the most helpful conversations I had was with a coworker who overheard me talking to someone else in my office cubicle.
She heard me say that Dylan could not have loved me if he could do something as horrible as he did.
Later, when she found me alone, she apologized for overhearing that conversation, but told me that I was wrong.
She said that when she was a young, single mother with three small children, she became severely depressed and was hospitalized to keep her safe.
At the time, she was certain that her children would be better off if she died, so she had made a plan to end her life.
She assured me that a mother's love was the strongest bond on Earth, and that she loved her children more than anything in the world, but because of her illness, she was sure that they would be better off without her.
What she said and what I've learned from others is that we do not make the so-called decision or choice to die by suicide in the same way that we choose what car to drive or where to go on a Saturday night.
When someone is in an extremely suicidal state, they are in a stage four medical health emergency.
Their thinking is impaired and they've lost access to tools of self-governance.
Even though they can make a plan and act with logic, their sense of truth is distorted by a filter of pain through which they interpret their reality.
Some people can be very good at hiding this state, and they often have good reasons for doing that.
Many of us have suicidal thoughts at some point, but persistent, ongoing thoughts of suicide and devising a means to die are symptoms of pathology, and like many illnesses, the condition has to be recognized and treated before a life is lost.
But my son's death was not purely a suicide.
It involved mass murder.
I wanted to know how his suicidal thinking became homicidal.
But research is sparse and there are no simple answers.
Yes, he probably had ongoing depression.
He had a personality that was perfectionistic and self-reliant, and that made him less likely to seek help from others.
He had experienced triggering events at the school that left him feeling debased and humiliated and mad.
And he had a complicated friendship with a boy who shared his feelings of rage and alienation, and who was seriously disturbed, controlling and homicidal.
And on top of this period in his life of extreme vulnerability and fragility, Dylan found access to guns even though we'd never owned any in our home.
It was appallingly easy for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns, both legally and illegally, without my permission or knowledge.
And somehow, 17 years and many school shootings later, it's still appallingly easy.
What Dylan did that day broke my heart, and as trauma so often does, it took a toll on my body and on my mind.
Two years after the shootings, I got breast cancer, and two years after that, I began to have mental health problems.
On top of the constant, perpetual grief I was terrified that I would run into a family member of someone Dylan had killed, or be accosted by the press or by an angry citizen.
I was afraid to turn on the news, afraid to hear myself being called a terrible parent or a disgusting person.
I started having panic attacks.
The first bout started four years after the shootings, when I was getting ready for the depositions and would have to meet the victims' families face to face.
The second round started six years after the shootings, when I was preparing to speak publicly about murder-suicide for the first time at a conference.
Both episodes lasted several weeks.
The attacks happened everywhere: in the hardware store, in my office, or even while reading a book in bed.
My mind would suddenly lock into this spinning cycle of terror and no matter how I hard I tried to calm myself down or reason my way out of it, I couldn't do it.
It felt as if my brain was trying to kill me, and then, being afraid of being afraid consumed all of my thoughts.
That's when I learned firsthand what it feels like to have a malfunctioning mind, and that's when I truly became a brain health advocate.
With therapy and medication and self-care, life eventually returned to whatever could be thought of as normal under the circumstances.
When I looked back on all that had happened, I could see that my son's spiral into dysfunction probably occurred over a period of about two years, plenty of time to get him help, if only someone had known that he needed help and known what to do.
Every time someone asks me, "How could you not have known?", it feels like a punch in the gut.
It carries accusation and taps into my feelings of guilt that no matter how much therapy I've had I will never fully eradicate.
But here's something I've learned: if love were enough to stop someone who is suicidal from hurting themselves, suicides would hardly ever happen.
But love is not enough, and suicide is prevalent.
It's the second leading cause of death for people age 10 to 34, and 15 percent of American youth report having made a suicide plan in the last year.
I've learned that no matter how much we want to believe we can, we cannot know or control everything our loved ones think and feel, and the stubborn belief that we are somehow different, that someone we love would never think of hurting themselves or someone else, can cause us to miss what's hidden in plain sight.
And if worst case scenarios do come to pass, we'll have to learn to forgive ourselves for not knowing or for not asking the right questions or not finding the right treatment.
We should always assume that someone we love may be suffering, regardless of what they say or how they act.
We should listen with our whole being, without judgments, and without offering solutions.
I know that I will live with this tragedy, with these multiple tragedies, for the rest of my life.
I know that in the minds of many, what I lost can't compare to what the other families lost.
I know my struggle doesn't make theirs any easier.
I know there are even some who think I don't have the right to any pain, but only to a life of permanent penance.
In the end what I know comes down to this: the tragic fact is that even the most vigilant and responsible of us may not be able to help, but for love's sake, we must never stop trying to know the unknowable.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So I'm here to talk to you about the walkable city.
What is the walkable city?
Well, for want of a better definition, it's a city in which the car is an optional instrument of freedom, rather than a prosthetic device.
And I'd like to talk about why we need the walkable city, and I'd like to talk about how to do the walkable city.
Most of the talks I give these days are about why we need it, but you guys are smart.
And also I gave that talk exactly a month ago, and you can see it at TED.com. So today I want to talk about how to do it.
In a lot of time thinking about this, I've come up with what I call the general theory of walkability.
A bit of a pretentious term, it's a little tongue-in-cheek, but it's something I've thought about for a long time, and I'd like to share what I think I've figured out.
In the American city, the typical American city -- the typical American city is not Washington, DC, or New York, or San Francisco; it's Grand Rapids or Cedar Rapids or Memphis -- in the typical American city in which most people own cars and the temptation is to drive them all the time, if you're going to get them to walk, then you have to offer a walk that's as good as a drive or better.
What does that mean? It means you need to offer four things simultaneously: there needs to be a proper reason to walk, the walk has to be safe and feel safe, the walk has to be comfortable and the walk has to be interesting.
You need to do all four of these things simultaneously, and that's the structure of my talk today, to take you through each of those.
The reason to walk is a story I learned from my mentors, Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, the founders of the New Urbanism movement.
And I should say half the slides and half of my talk today I learned from them.
It's the story of planning, the story of the formation of the planning profession.
When in the 19th century people were choking from the soot of the dark, satanic mills, the planners said, hey, let's move the housing away from the mills.
And lifespans increased immediately, dramatically, and we like to say the planners have been trying to repeat that experience ever since.
So there's the onset of what we call Euclidean zoning, the separation of the landscape into large areas of single use.
And typically when I arrive in a city to do a plan, a plan like this already awaits me on the property that I'm looking at.
And all a plan like this guarantees is that you will not have a walkable city, because nothing is located near anything else.
The alternative, of course, is our most walkable city, and I like to say, you know, this is a Rothko, and this is a Seurat.
It's just a different way -- he was the pointilist -- it's a different way of making places.
And even this map of Manhattan is a bit misleading because the red color is uses that are mixed vertically.
So this is the big story of the New Urbanists -- to acknowledge that there are only two ways that have been tested by the thousands to build communities, in the world and throughout history.
One is the traditional neighborhood.
You see here several neighborhoods of Newburyport, Massachusetts, which is defined as being compact and being diverse -- places to live, work, shop, recreate, get educated -- all within walking distance.
And it's defined as being walkable.
There are lots of small streets.
Each one is comfortable to walk on.
And we contrast that to the other way, an invention that happened after the Second World War, suburban sprawl, clearly not compact, clearly not diverse, and it's not walkable, because so few of the streets connect, that those streets that do connect become overburdened, and you wouldn't let your kid out on them.
And I want to thank Alex Maclean, the aerial photographer, for many of these beautiful pictures that I'm showing you today.
So it's fun to break sprawl down into its constituent parts.
It's so easy to understand, the places where you only live, the places where you only work, the places where you only shop, and our super-sized public institutions.
Schools get bigger and bigger, and therefore, further and further from each other.
And the ratio of the size of the parking lot to the size of the school tells you all you need to know, which is that no child has ever walked to this school, no child will ever walk to this school.
The seniors and juniors are driving the freshmen and the sophomores, and of course we have the crash statistics to prove it.
And then the super-sizing of our other civic institutions like playing fields — it's wonderful that Westin in the Ft.
Lauderdale area has eight soccer fields and eight baseball diamonds and 20 tennis courts, but look at the road that takes you to that location, and would you let your child bike on it?
And this is why we have the soccer mom now.
When I was young, I had one soccer field, one baseball diamond and one tennis court, but I could walk to it, because it was in my neighborhood.
Then the final part of sprawl that everyone forgot to count: if you're going to separate everything from everything else and reconnect it only with automotive infrastructure, then this is what your landscape begins to look like.
The main message here is: if you want to have a walkable city, you can't start with the sprawl model. you need the bones of an urban model.
This is the outcome of that form of design, as is this.
And this is something that a lot of Americans want.
But we have to understand it's a two-part American dream.
If you're dreaming for this, you're also going to be dreaming of this, often to absurd extremes, when we build our landscape to accommodate cars first.
And the experience of being in these places — (Laughter)
This is not Photoshopped. Walter Kulash took this slide.
It's in Panama City.
This is a real place.
And being a driver can be a bit of a nuisance, and being a pedestrian can be a bit of a nuisance in these places.
This is a slide that epidemiologists have been showing for some time now, (Laughter) The fact that we have a society where you drive to the parking lot to take the escalator to the treadmill shows that we're doing something wrong.
But we know how to do it better. Here are the two models contrasted.
I show this slide, which has been a formative document of the New Urbanism now for almost 30 years, to show that sprawl and the traditional neighborhood contain the same things.
It's just how big are they, how close are they to each other, how are they interspersed together and do you have a street network, rather than a cul-de-sac or a collector system of streets?
So when we look at a downtown area, at a place that has a hope of being walkable, and mostly that's our downtowns in America's cities and towns and villages, we look at them and say we want the proper balance of uses.
So what is missing or underrepresented?
And again, in the typical American cities in which most Americans live, it is housing that is lacking.
The jobs-to-housing balance is off.
And you find that when you bring housing back, these other things start to come back too, and housing is usually first among those things.
And, of course, the thing that shows up last and eventually is the schools, because the people have to move in, the young pioneers have to move in, get older, have kids and fight, and then the schools get pretty good eventually.
The other part of this part, the useful city part, is transit, and you can have a perfectly walkable neighborhood without it.
But perfectly walkable cities require transit, because if you don't have access to the whole city as a pedestrian, then you get a car, and if you get a car, the city begins to reshape itself around your needs, and the streets get wider and the parking lots get bigger and you no longer have a walkable city.
So transit is essential.
But every transit experience, every transit trip, begins or ends as a walk, and so we have to remember to build walkability around our transit stations.
Next category, the biggest one, is the safe walk.
It's what most walkability experts talk about.
It is essential, but alone not enough to get people to walk.
And there are so many moving parts that add up to a walkable city. The first is block size.
This is Portland, Oregon, famously 200-foot blocks, famously walkable.
This is Salt Lake City, famously 600-foot blocks, famously unwalkable.
If you look at the two, it's almost like two different planets, but these places were both built by humans and in fact, the story is that when you have a 200-foot block city, you can have a two-lane city, or a two-to-four lane city, and a 600-foot block city is a six-lane city, and that's a problem. These are the crash statistics. When you double the block size -- this was a study of 24 California cities -- when you double the block size, you almost quadruple the number of fatal accidents on non-highway streets.
So how many lanes do we have?
This is where I'm going to tell you what I tell every audience I meet, which is to remind you about induced demand.
Induced demand applies both to highways and to city streets.
And induced demand tells us that when we widen the streets to accept the congestion that we're anticipating, or the additional trips that we're anticipating in congested systems, it is principally that congestion that is constraining demand, and so that the widening comes, and there are all of these latent trips that are ready to happen.
People move further from work and make other choices about when they commute, and those lanes fill up very quickly with traffic, so we widen the street again, and they fill up again. And we've learned that in congested systems, we cannot satisfy the automobile.
This is from Newsweek Magazine -- hardly an esoteric publication: "Today's engineers acknowledge that building new roads usually makes traffic worse." My response to reading this was, may I please meet some of these engineers, because these are not the ones that I -- there are great exceptions that I'm working with now -- but these are not the engineers one typically meets working in a city, where they say, "Oh, that road is too crowded, we need to add a lane." So you add a lane, and the traffic comes, and they say, "See, I told you we needed that lane." This applies both to highways and to city streets if they're congested.
But the amazing thing about most American cities that I work in, the more typical cities, is that they have a lot of streets that are actually oversized for the congestion they're currently experiencing.
This was the case in Oklahoma City, when the mayor came running to me, very upset, because they were named in Prevention Magazine the worst city for pedestrians in the entire country.
Now that can't possibly be true, but it certainly is enough to make a mayor do something about it. We did a walkability study, and what we found, looking at the car counts on the street -- these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts and we know that two lanes can handle 10,000 cars per day.
Look at these numbers -- they're all near or under 10,000 cars, and these were the streets that were designated in the new downtown plan to be four lanes to six lanes wide.
So you had a fundamental disconnect between the number of lanes and the number of cars that wanted to use them.
So it was my job to redesign every street in the downtown from curb face to curb face, and we did it for 50 blocks of streets, and we're rebuilding it now.
So a typical oversized street to nowhere is being narrowed, and now under construction, and the project is half done.
The typical street like this, you know, when you do that, you find room for medians.
You find room for bike lanes.
We've doubled the amount of on-street parking.
We've added a full bike network where one didn't exist before.
But not everyone has the money that Oklahoma City has, because they have an extraction economy that's doing quite well.
The typical city is more like Cedar Rapids, where they have an all four-lane system, half one-way system.
And it's a little hard to see, but what we've done -- what we're doing; it's in process right now, it's in engineering right now -- is turning an all four-lane system, half one-way into an all two-lane system, all two-way, and in so doing, we're adding 70 percent more on-street parking, which the merchants love, and it protects the sidewalk.
That parking makes the sidewalk safe, and we're adding a much more robust bicycle network.
Then the lanes themselves. How wide are they?
That's really important.
The standards have changed such that, as Andrés Duany says, the typical road to a subdivision in America allows you to see the curvature of the Earth.
(Laughter)
This is a subdivision outside of Washington from the 1960s.
Look very carefully at the width of the streets.
This is a subdivision from the 1980s. 1960s, 1980s. The standards have changed to such a degree that my old neighborhood of South Beach, when it was time to fix the street that wasn't draining properly, they had to widen it and take away half our sidewalk, because the standards were wider.
People go faster on wider streets. People know this. The engineers deny it, but the citizens know it, so that in Birmingham, Michigan, they fight for narrower streets.
Portland, Oregon, famously walkable, instituted its "Skinny Streets" program in its residential neighborhood.
We know that skinny streets are safer.
The developer Vince Graham, in his project I'On, which we worked on in South Carolina, he goes to conferences and he shows his amazing 22-foot roads. These are two-way roads, very narrow rights of way, and he shows this well-known philosopher, who said, "Broad is the road that leads to destruction... narrow is the road that leads to life." (Laughter)
But where you build it, they come.
As a planner, I hate to say that, but the one thing I can say is that bicycle population is a function of bicycle infrastructure. I asked my friend Tom Brennan from Nelson\Nygaard in Portland to send me some pictures of the Portland bike commute.
He sent me this. I said, "Was that bike to work day?" He said, "No, that was Tuesday." When you do what Portland did and spend money on bicycle infrastructure -- New York City has doubled the number of bikers in it several times now by painting these bright green lanes. Even automotive cities like Long Beach, California: vast uptick in the number of bikers based on the infrastructure. And of course, what really does it, if you know 15th Street here in Washington, DC -- please meet Rahm Emanuel's new bike lanes in Chicago, the buffered lane, the parallel parking pulled off the curb, the bikes between the parked cars and the curb -- these mint cyclists.
If, however, as in Pasadena, every lane is a bike lane, then no lane is a bike lane.
And this is the only bicyclist that I met in Pasadena, so... (Laughter) The parallel parking I mentioned — it's an essential barrier of steel that protects the curb and pedestrians from moving vehicles. This is Ft. Lauderdale; one side of the street, you can park, the other side of the street, you can't. This is happy hour on the parking side.
This is sad hour on the other side.
And then the trees themselves slow cars down. They move slower when trees are next to the road, and, of course, sometimes they slow down very quickly.
All the little details -- the curb return radius.
Is it one foot or is it 40 feet?
How swoopy is that curb to determine how fast the car goes and how much room you have to cross.
And then I love this, because this is objective journalism. "Some say the entrance to CityCenter is not inviting to pedestrians." When every aspect of the landscape is swoopy, is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics, it says: "This is a vehicular place." So no one detail, no one speciality, can be allowed to set the stage.
And here, you know, this street: yes, it will drain within a minute of the hundred-year storm, but this poor woman has to mount the curb every day.
So then quickly, the comfortable walk has to do with the fact that all animals seek, simultaneously, prospect and refuge.
We want to be able to see our predators, but we also want to feel that our flanks are covered. And so we're drawn to places that have good edges, and if you don't supply the edges, people won't want to be there.
What's the proper ratio of height to width?
Is it one to one? Three to one? If you get beyond one to six, you're not very comfortable anymore.
You don't feel enclosed.
Now, six to one in Salzburg can be perfectly delightful.
The opposite of Salzburg is Houston.
The point being the parking lot is the principal problem here.
However, missing teeth, those empty lots can be issues as well, and if you have a missing corner because of an outdated zoning code, then you could have a missing nose in your neighborhood.
That's what we had in my neighborhood.
This was the zoning code that said I couldn't build on that site. As you may know, Washington, DC is now changing its zoning to allow sites like this to become sites like this.
We needed a lot of variances to do that.
Triangular houses can be interesting to build, but if you get one built, people generally like it.
So you've got to fill those missing noses.
And then, finally, the interesting walk: signs of humanity.
We are among the social primates.
Nothing interests us more than other people.
We want signs of people.
So the perfect one-to-one ratio, it's a great thing.
This is Grand Rapids, a very walkable city, but nobody walks on this street that connects the two best hotels together, because if on the left, you have an exposed parking deck, and on the right, you have a conference facility that was apparently designed in admiration for that parking deck, then you don't attract that many people.
Mayor Joe Riley, in his 10th term, Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina, taught us it only takes 25 feet of building to hide 250 feet of garage.
This one I call the Chia Pet Garage.
It's in South Beach. That active ground floor. I want to end with this project that I love to show.
It's by Meleca Architects.
It's in Columbus, Ohio.
To the left is the convention center neighborhood, full of pedestrians.
To the right is the Short North neighborhood -- ethnic, great restaurants, great shops, struggling.
It wasn't doing very well because this was the bridge, and no one was walking from the convention center into that neighborhood.
Well, when they rebuilt the highway, they added an extra 80 feet to the bridge.
Sorry -- they rebuilt the bridge over the highway.
The city paid 1.9 million dollars, they gave the site to a developer, the developer built this and now the Short North has come back to life.
And everyone says, the newspapers, not the planning magazines, the newspapers say it's because of that bridge.
So that's it. That's the general theory of walkability.
Think about your own cities.
Think about how you can apply it.
You've got to do all four things at once.
So find those places where you have most of them and fix what you can, fix what still needs fixing in those places.
(Applause) I really appreciate your attention, and thank you for coming today.
Worldwide, over 1.5 billion people experience armed conflict.
In response, people are forced to flee their country, leaving over 15 million refugees.
Children, without a doubt, are the most innocent and vulnerable victims ... but not just from the obvious physical dangers, but from the often unspoken effects that wars have on their families.
The experiences of war leave children at a real high risk for the development of emotional and behavioral problems.
Children, as we can only imagine, will feel worried, threatened and at risk.
But there is good news.
The quality of care that children receive in their families can have a more significant effect on their well-being than from the actual experiences of war that they have been exposed to.
So actually, children can be protected by warm, secure parenting during and after conflict.
In 2011, I was a first-year PhD student in the University of Manchester School of Psychological Sciences.
Like many of you here, I watched the crisis in Syria unfold in front of me on the TV.
My family is originally from Syria, and very early on, I lost several family members in really horrifying ways.
I'd sit and I'd gather with my family and watch the TV.
We've all seen those scenes: bombs destroying buildings, chaos, destruction and people screaming and running.
It was always the people screaming and running that really got me the most, especially those terrified-looking children.
I was a mother to two young, typically inquisitive children.
They were five and six then, at an age where they typically asked lots and lots of questions, and expected real, convincing answers.
So, I began to wonder what it might be like to parent my children in a war zone and a refugee camp. Would my children change? Would my daughter's bright, happy eyes lose their shine?
Would my son's really relaxed and carefree nature become fearful and withdrawn? How would I cope? Would I change?
As psychologists and parent trainers, we know that arming parents with skills in caring for their children can have a huge effect on their well-being, and we call this parent training.
The question I had was, could parent training programs be useful for families while they were still in war zones or refugee camps?
Could we reach them with advice or training that would help them through these struggles?
So I approached my PhD supervisor, Professor Rachel Calam, with the idea of using my academic skills to make some change in the real world.
I wasn't quite sure what exactly I wanted to do.
She listened carefully and patiently, and then to my joy she said, "If that's what you want to do, and it means so much to you, then let's do it.
Let's find ways to see if parent programs can be useful for families in these contexts." So for the past five years, myself and my colleagues -- Prof. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright -- have been working on ways to support families that have experienced war and displacement.
Now, to know how to help families that have been through conflict support their children, the first step must obviously be to ask them what they're struggling with, right?
I mean, it seems obvious.
But it's often those that are the most vulnerable, that we're trying to support, that we actually don't ask.
How many times have we just assumed we know exactly the right thing that's going to help someone or something without actually asking them first?
So I travelled to refugee camps in Syria and in Turkey, and I sat with families, and I listened.
I listened to their parenting challenges, I listened to their parenting struggles and I listened to their call for help.
And sometimes that was just paused, as all I could do was hold hands with them and just join them in silent crying and prayer.
They told me about their struggles, they told me about the rough, harsh refugee camp conditions that made it hard to focus on anything but practical chores like collecting clean water.
They told me how they watched their children withdraw; the sadness, depression, anger, bed-wetting, thumb-sucking, fear of loud noises, fear of nightmares -- terrifying, terrifying nightmares.
These families had been through what we had been watching on the TV.
The mothers -- almost half of them were now widows of war, or didn't even know if their husbands were dead or alive -- described how they felt they were coping so badly.
They watched their children change and they had no idea how to help them.
They didn't know how to answer their children's questions.
What I found incredibly astonishing and so motivational was that these families were so motivated to support their children.
Despite all these challenges they faced, they were trying to help their children.
They were making attempts at seeking support from NGO workers, from refugee camp teachers, professional medics, other parents.
One mother I met had only been in a camp for four days, and had already made two attempts at seeking support for her eight-year-old daughter who was having terrifying nightmares.
But sadly, these attempts are almost always useless.
Refugee camp doctors, when available, are almost always too busy, or don't have the knowledge or the time for basic parenting supports.
Refugee camp teachers and other parents are just like them — part of a new refugee community who's struggling with new needs.
So then we began to think.
How could we help these families?
The families were struggling with things much bigger than they could cope with.
The Syrian crisis made it clear how incredibly impossible it would be to reach families on an individual level.
How else could we help them?
How would we reach families at a population level and low costs in these terrifying, terrifying times?
After hours of speaking to NGO workers, one suggested a fantastic innovative idea of distributing parenting information leaflets via bread wrappers -- bread wrappers that were being delivered to families in a conflict zone in Syria by humanitarian workers.
So that's what we did.
The bread wrappers haven't changed at all in their appearance, except for the addition of two pieces of paper.
One was a parenting information leaflet that had basic advice and information that normalized to the parent what they might be experiencing, and what their child might be experiencing.
And information on how they could support themselves and their children, such as information like spending time talking to your child, showing them more affection, being more patient with your child, talking to your children.
The other piece of paper was a feedback questionnaire, and of course, there was a pen.
So is this simply leaflet distribution, or is this actually a possible means of delivering psychological first aid that provides warm, secure, loving parenting?
We managed to distribute 3,000 of these in just one week.
What was incredible was we had a 60 percent response rate.
60 percent of the 3,000 families responded.
I don't know how many researchers we have here today, but that kind of response rate is fantastic.
To have that in Manchester would be a huge achievement, let alone in a conflict zone in Syria -- really highlighting how important these kinds of messages were to families.
I remember how excited and eager we were for the return of the questionnaires.
The families had left hundreds of messages -- most incredibly positive and encouraging.
But my favorite has got to be, "Thank you for not forgetting about us and our children." This really illustrates the potential means of the delivery of psychological first aid to families, and the return of feedback, too.
Just imagine replicating this using other means such as baby milk distribution, or female hygiene kits, or even food baskets.
But let's bring this closer to home, because the refugee crisis is one that is having an effect on every single one of us.
We're bombarded with images daily of statistics and of photos, and that's not surprising, because by last month, over one million refugees had reached Europe. One million. Refugees are joining our communities, they're becoming our neighbors, their children are attending our children's schools.
So we've adapted the leaflet to meet the needs of European refugees, and we have them online, open-access, in areas with a really high refugee influx.
For example, the Swedish healthcare uploaded it onto their website, and within the first 45 minutes, it was downloaded 343 times -- really highlighting how important it is for volunteers, practitioners and other parents to have open-access, psychological first-aid messages.
In 2013, I was sitting on the cold, hard floor of a refugee camp tent with mothers sitting around me as I was conducting a focus group.
Across from me stood an elderly lady with what seemed to be a 13-year-old girl lying beside her, with her head on the elderly lady's knees.
The girl stayed quiet throughout the focus group, not talking at all, with her knees curled up against her chest.
Towards the end of the focus group, and as I was thanking the mothers for their time, the elderly lady looked at me while pointing at the young girl, and said to me, "Can you help us with...?" Not quite sure what she expected me to do, I looked at the young girl and smiled, and in Arabic I said, "Salaam alaikum.
Shu-ismak? "" What's your name? "She looked at me really confused and unengaged, but then said," Halul. "Halul is the pet's name for the Arabic female name, Hala, and is only really used to refer to really young girls.
At that point I realized that actually Hala was probably much older than 13.
It turns out Hala was a 25-year-old mother to three young children.
Hala had been a confident, bright, bubbly, loving, caring mother to her children, but the war had changed all of that.
She had lived through bombs being dropped in her town; she had lived through explosions.
When fighter jets were flying around their building, dropping bombs, her children would be screaming, terrified from the noise.
Hala would frantically grab pillows and cover her children's ears to block out the noise, all the while screaming herself.
When they reached the refugee camp and she knew they were finally in some kind of safety, she completely withdrew to acting like her old childhood self.
She completely rejected her family -- her children, her husband.
Hala simply could no longer cope.
This is a parenting struggle with a really tough ending, but sadly, it's not uncommon.
Those who experience armed conflict and displacement will face serious emotional struggles.
And that's something we can all relate to.
If you have been through a devastating time in your life, if you have lost someone or something you really care about, how would you continue to cope?
Could you still be able to care for yourself and for your family?
Given that the first years of a child's life are crucial for healthy physical and emotional development, and that 1.5 billion people are experiencing armed conflict -- many of whom are now joining our communities -- we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the needs of those who are experiencing war and displacement.
We must prioritize these families' needs -- both those who are internally displaced, and those who are refugees worldwide.
These needs must be prioritized by NGO workers, policy makers, the WHO, the UNHCR and every single one of us in whatever capacity it is that we function in our society.
When we begin to recognize the individual faces of the conflict, when we begin to notice those intricate emotions on their faces, we begin to see them as humans, too.
We begin to see the needs of these families, and these are the real human needs.
When these family needs are prioritized, interventions for children in humanitarian settings will prioritize and recognize the primary role of the family in supporting children.
Family mental health will be shouting loud and clear in global, international agenda.
And children will be less likely to enter social service systems in resettlement countries because their families would have had support earlier on.
And we will be more open-minded, more welcoming, more caring and more trusting to those who are joining our communities.
We need to stop wars.
We need to build a world where children can dream of planes dropping gifts, and not bombs.
Until we stop armed conflicts raging throughout the world, families will continue to be displaced, leaving children vulnerable.
But by improving parenting and caregiver support, it may be possible to weaken the links between war and psychological difficulties in children and their families.
Thank you. (Applause)
People have been using media to talk about sex for a long time. Love letters, phone sex, racy Polaroids.
There's even a story of a girl who eloped with a man that she met over the telegraph in 1886.
Today we have sexting, and I am a sexting expert. Not an expert sexter.
(Laughter) I have been studying sexting since the media attention to it began in 2008.
I wrote a book on the moral panic about sexting.
And here's what I found: most people are worrying about the wrong thing.
They're trying to just prevent sexting from happening entirely.
But let me ask you this: As long as it's completely consensual, what's the problem with sexting?
People are into all sorts of things that you may not be into, like blue cheese or cilantro. (Laughter) Sexting is certainly risky, like anything that's fun, but as long as you're not sending an image to someone who doesn't want to receive it, there's no harm.
What I do think is a serious problem is when people share private images of others without their permission.
And instead of worrying about sexting, what I think we need to do is think a lot more about digital privacy.
The key is consent. Right now most people are thinking about sexting without really thinking about consent at all.
Did you know that we currently criminalize teen sexting?
It can be a crime because it counts as child pornography, if there's an image of someone under 18, and it doesn't even matter if they took that image of themselves and shared it willingly.
So we end up with this bizarre legal situation where two 17-year-olds can legally have sex in most US states but they can't photograph it.
Some states have also tried passing sexting misdemeanor laws but these laws repeat the same problem because they still make consensual sexting illegal.
It doesn't make sense to try to ban all sexting to try to address privacy violations.
This is kind of like saying, let's solve the problem of date rape by just making dating completely illegal.
Most teens don't get arrested for sexting, but can you guess who does?
It's often teens who are disliked by their partner's parents.
And this can be because of class bias, racism or homophobia.
Most prosecutors are, of course, smart enough not to use child pornography charges against teenagers, but some do.
According to researchers at the University of New Hampshire seven percent of all child pornography possession arrests are teens, sexting consensually with other teens.
Child pornography is a serious crime, but it's just not the same thing as teen sexting.
Parents and educators are also responding to sexting without really thinking too much about consent.
Their message to teens is often: just don't do it.
And I totally get it -- there are serious legal risks and of course, that potential for privacy violations.
And when you were a teen, I'm sure you did exactly as you were told, right?
You're probably thinking, my kid would never sext.
And that's true, your little angel may not be sexting because only 33 percent of 16- and 17-year-olds are sexting.
But, sorry, by the time they're older, odds are they will be sexting.
Every study I've seen puts the rate above 50 percent for 18- to 24-year-olds.
And most of the time, nothing goes wrong.
People ask me all the time things like, isn't sexting just so dangerous, though?
It's like you wouldn't leave your wallet on a park bench and you expect it's going to get stolen if you do that, right?
Here's how I think about it: sexting is like leaving your wallet at your boyfriend's house.
If you come back the next day and all the money is just gone, you really need to dump that guy. (Laughter) So instead of criminalizing sexting to try to prevent these privacy violations, instead we need to make consent central to how we think about the circulation of our private information.
Every new media technology raises privacy concerns.
In fact, in the US the very first major debates about privacy were in response to technologies that were relatively new at the time. In the late 1800s, people were worried about cameras, which were just suddenly more portable than ever before, and newspaper gossip columns.
Does this sound familiar? It's exactly what we're worrying about now with social media and drone cameras, and, of course, sexting.
And these fears about technology, they make sense because technologies can amplify and bring out our worst qualities and behaviors.
But there are solutions.
And we've been here before with a dangerous new technology.
In 1908, Ford introduced the Model T car. Traffic fatality rates were rising.
It was a serious problem -- it looks so safe, right?
Our first response was to try to change drivers' behavior, so we developed speed limits and enforced them through fines.
But over the following decades, we started to realize the technology of the car itself is not just neutral.
We could design the car to make it safer.
So in the 1920s, we got shatter-resistant windshields.
In the 1950s, seat belts.
And in the 1990s, airbags.
All three of these areas: laws, individuals and industry came together over time to help solve the problem that a new technology causes.
And we can do the same thing with digital privacy.
Of course, it comes back to consent.
Here's the idea. Before anyone can distribute your private information, they should have to get your permission.
This idea of affirmative consent comes from anti-rape activists who tell us that we need consent for every sexual act.
And we have really high standards for consent in a lot of other areas.
Think about having surgery. Your doctor has to make sure that you are meaningfully and knowingly consenting to that medical procedure.
This is not the type of consent like with an iTunes Terms of Service where you just scroll to the bottom and you're like, agree, agree, whatever. (Laughter) If we think more about consent, we can have better privacy laws.
Right now, we just don't have that many protections.
If your ex-husband or your ex-wife is a terrible person, they can take your nude photos and upload them to a porn site.
It can be really hard to get those images taken down.
And in a lot of states, you're actually better off if you took the images of yourself because then you can file a copyright claim. (Laughter) Right now, if someone violates your privacy, whether that's an individual or a company or the NSA, you can try filing a lawsuit, though you may not be successful because many courts assume that digital privacy is just impossible.
So they're not willing to punish anyone for violating it.
I still hear people asking me all the time, isn't a digital image somehow blurring the line between public and private because it's digital, right? No! No! Everything digital is not just automatically public.
That doesn't make any sense.
As NYU legal scholar Helen Nissenbaum tells us, we have laws and policies and norms that protect all kinds of information that's private, and it doesn't make a difference if it's digital or not.
All of your health records are digitized but your doctor can't just share them with anyone.
All of your financial information is held in digital databases, but your credit card company can't just post your purchase history online.
Better laws could help address privacy violations after they happen, but one of the easiest things we can all do is make personal changes to help protect each other's privacy.
We're always told that privacy is our own, sole, individual responsibility.
We're told, constantly monitor and update your privacy settings.
We're told, never share anything you wouldn't want the entire world to see.
This doesn't make sense.
Digital media are social environments and we share things with people we trust all day, every day.
As Princeton researcher Janet Vertesi argues, our data and our privacy, they're not just personal, they're actually interpersonal.
And so one thing you can do that's really easy is just start asking for permission before you share anyone else's information.
If you want to post a photo of someone online, ask for permission.
If you want to forward an email thread, ask for permission.
And if you want to share someone's nude selfie, obviously, ask for permission.
These individual changes can really help us protect each other's privacy, but we need technology companies on board as well.
These companies have very little incentive to help protect our privacy because their business models depend on us sharing everything with as many people as possible.
Right now, if I send you an image, you can forward that to anyone that you want.
But what if I got to decide if that image was forwardable or not?
This would tell you, you don't have my permission to send this image out.
We do this kind of thing all the time to protect copyright.
If you buy an e-book, you can't just send it out to as many people as you want.
So why not try this with mobile phones?
What you can do is we can demand that tech companies add these protections to our devices and our platforms as the default.
After all, you can choose the color of your car, but the airbags are always standard.
If we don't think more about digital privacy and consent, there can be serious consequences.
There was a teenager from Ohio -- let's call her Jennifer, for the sake of her privacy.
She shared nude photos of herself with her high school boyfriend, thinking she could trust him.
Unfortunately, he betrayed her and sent her photos around the entire school.
Jennifer was embarrassed and humiliated, but instead of being compassionate, her classmates harassed her.
They called her a slut and a whore and they made her life miserable.
Jennifer started missing school and her grades dropped.
Ultimately, Jennifer decided to end her own life.
Jennifer did nothing wrong. All she did was share a nude photo with someone she thought that she could trust.
And yet our laws tell her that she committed a horrible crime equivalent to child pornography.
Our gender norms tell her that by producing this nude image of herself, she somehow did the most horrible, shameful thing.
And when we assume that privacy is impossible in digital media, we completely write off and excuse her boyfriend's bad, bad behavior.
People are still saying all the time to victims of privacy violations, "What were you thinking?
You should have never sent that image." If you're trying to figure out what to say instead, try this.
Imagine you've run into your friend who broke their leg skiing.
They took a risk to do something fun, and it didn't end well.
But you're probably not going to be the jerk who says, "Well, I guess you shouldn't have gone skiing then." If we think more about consent, we can see that victims of privacy violations deserve our compassion, not criminalization, shaming, harassment or punishment.
We can support victims, and we can prevent some privacy violations by making these legal, individual and technological changes.
Because the problem is not sexting, the issue is digital privacy.
And one solution is consent.
So the next time a victim of a privacy violation comes up to you, instead of blaming them, let's do this instead: let's shift our ideas about digital privacy, and let's respond with compassion.
Thank you. (Applause)
Most of you can probably relate to what I'm feeling right now.
My heart is racing in my chest.
My palms are a little bit clammy. I'm sweating. And my breath is a little bit shallow.
Now, these familiar sensations are obviously the result of standing up in front of a thousand of you and giving a talk that might be streamed online to perhaps a million more.
But the physical sensations I'm experiencing right now are actually the result of a much more basic mind-body mechanism.
My nervous system is sending a flood of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline into my bloodstream.
It's a very old and very necessary response that sends blood and oxygen to the organs and muscles that I might need to respond quickly to a potential threat.
But there's a problem with this response, and that is, it can get over-activated.
If I face these kinds of stressors on a daily basis, particularly over an extended period of time, my system can get overloaded.
So basically, if this response happens infrequently: super-necessary for my well-being and survival.
But if it happens too much, it can actually make me sick.
There's a growing body of research examining the relationship between chronic stress and illness.
Things like heart disease and even cancer are being shown to have a relationship to stress.
And that's because, over time, too much activation from stress can interfere with my body's processes that keep me healthy.
Now, let's imagine for a moment that I was pregnant.
What might this kind of stress, particularly over the length of my pregnancy, what kind of impact might that have on the health of my developing fetus?
You probably won't be surprised when I tell you that this kind of stress during pregnancy is not good.
It can even cause the body to initiate labor too early, because in a basic sense, the stress communicates that the womb is no longer a safe place for the child.
Stress during pregnancy is linked with things like high blood pressure and low infant birth weight, and it can begin a cascade of health challenges that make birth much more dangerous for both parent and child.
Now of course stress, particularly in our modern lifestyle, is a somewhat universal experience, right?
Maybe you've never stood up to give a TED Talk, but you've faced a big presentation at work, a sudden job loss, a big test, a heated conflict with a family member or friend.
But it turns out that the kind of stress we experience and whether we're able to stay in a relaxed state long enough to keep our bodies working properly depends a lot on who we are.
There's also a growing body of research showing that people who experience more discrimination are more likely to have poor health.
Even the threat of discrimination, like worrying you might be stopped by police while driving your car, can have a negative impact on your health.
Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams, the person who pioneered the tools that have proven these linkages, says that the more marginalized groups in our society experience more discrimination and more impacts on their health.
I've been interested in these issues for over a decade.
I became interested in maternal health when a failed premed trajectory instead sent me down a path looking for other ways to help pregnant people.
I became a doula, a lay person trained to provide support to people during pregnancy and childbirth.
And because I'm Latina and a Spanish speaker, in my first volunteer doula gig at a public hospital in North Carolina, I saw clearly how race and class impacted the experiences of the women that I supported.
If we take a look at the statistics about the rates of illness during pregnancy and childbirth, we see clearly the pattern outlined by Dr. Williams. African-American women in particular have an entirely different experience than white women when it comes to whether their babies are born healthy.
In certain parts of the country, particularly the Deep South, the rates of mother and infant death for black women actually approximate those rates in Sub-Saharan African.
In those same communities, the rates for white women are near zero.
Even nationally, black women are four times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than white women.
Four times more likely to die.
They're also twice as likely for their infants to die before the first year of life than white infants, and two to three times more likely to give birth too early or too skinny -- a sign of insufficient development.
than white women. Native women are also more likely to have higher rates of these problems as are some groups of Latinas.
For the last decade as a doula turned journalist and blogger, I've been trying to raise the alarm about just how different the experiences of women of color, but particularly black women, are when it comes to pregnancy and birth in the US.
But when I tell people about these appalling statistics, I'm usually met with an assumption that it's about either poverty or lack of access to care.
But it turns out, neither of these things tell the whole story.
Even middle-class black women still have much worse outcomes than their middle-class white counterparts.
The gap actually widens among this group.
And while access to care is definitely still a problem, even women of color who receive the recommended prenatal care still suffer from these high rates.
And so we come back to the path from discrimination to stress to poor health, and it begins to paint a picture that many people of color know to be true: racism is actually making us sick.
Still sound like a stretch?
Consider this: immigrants, particularly black and Latina immigrants, actually have better health when they first arrive in the United States.
But the longer they stay in this country, the worse their health becomes.
People like me, born in the United States to Cuban immigrant parents, are actually more likely to have worse health than my grandparents did.
It's what researchers call "the immigrant paradox," and it further illustrates that there's something in the US environment that is making us sick.
But here's the thing: this problem, that racism is making people of color, but especially black women and babies, sick, is vast.
I could spend all of my time with you talking about it, but I won't, because I want to make sure to tell you about one solution.
And the good news is, it's a solution that isn't particularly expensive, and doesn't require any fancy drug treatments or new technologies.
The solution is called, "The JJ Way."
Meet Jennie Joseph. She's a midwife in the Orlando, Florida area who has been serving pregnant women for over a decade.
In what she calls her easy-access clinics, Jennie and her team provide prenatal care to over 600 women per year.
Her clients, most of whom are black, Haitian and Latina, deliver at the local hospital. But by providing accessible and respectful prenatal care, Jennie has achieved something remarkable: almost all of her clients give birth to healthy, full-term babies.
Her method is deceptively simple.
Jennie says that all of her appointments start at the front desk.
Every member of her team, and every moment a women is at her clinic, is as supportive as possible.
No one is turned away due to lack of funds.
The JJ Way is to make the finances work no matter what the hurdles.
No one is chastised for showing up late to their appointments.
No one is talked down to or belittled.
Jennie's waiting room feels more like your aunt's living room than a clinic.
She calls this space "a classroom in disguise." With the plush chairs arranged in a circle, women wait for their appointments in one-on-one chats with a staff educator, or in group prenatal classes.
When you finally are called back to your appointment, you are greeted by Alexis or Trina, two of Jennie's medical assistants.
Both are young, African-American and moms themselves.
Their approach is casual and friendly.
During one visit I observed, Trina chatted with a young soon-to-be mom while she took her blood pressure.
This Latina mom was having trouble keeping food down due to nausea.
As Trina deflated the blood pressure cuff, she said, "We'll see about changing your prescription, OK?
We can't have you not eating." That "we" is actually a really crucial aspect of Jennie's model.
She sees her staff as part of a team that, alongside the woman and her family, has one goal: get mom to term with a healthy baby.
Jennie says that Trina and Alexis are actually the center of her care model, and that her role as a provider is just to support their work.
Trina spends a lot of her day on her cell phone, texting with clients about all sorts of things.
One woman texted to ask if a medication she was prescribed at the hospital was OK to take while pregnant.
The answer was no.
Another woman texted with pictures of an infant born under Jennie's care.
Lastly, when you finally are called back to see the provider, you've already taken your own weight in the waiting room, and done your own pee test in the bathroom.
This is a big departure from the traditional medical model, because it places responsibility and information back in the woman's hands.
So rather than a medical setting where you might be chastised for not keeping up with provider recommendations -- the kind of settings often available to low-income women -- Jennie's model is to be as supportive as possible.
And that support provides a crucial buffer to the stress of racism and discrimination facing these women every day.
But here's the best thing about Jennie's model: it's been incredibly successful.
Remember those statistics I told you, that black women are more likely to give birth too early, to give birth to low birth weight babies, to even die due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth?
Well, The JJ Way has almost entirely eliminated those problems, starting with what Jennie calls "skinny babies." She's been able to get almost all her clients to term with healthy, chunky babies like this one.
Audience: Aw!
Miriam Zoila Pérez: This is a baby girl born to a client of Jennie's this past June.
A similar demographic of women in Jennie's area who gave birth at the same hospital her clients did were three times more likely to give birth to a baby below a healthy weight.
Jennie is making headway into what has been seen for decades as an almost intractable problem.
Some of you might be thinking, all this one-on-one attention that The JJ Way requires must be too expensive to scale. Well, you'd be wrong.
The visit with the provider is not the center of Jennie's model, and for good reason. Those visits are expensive, and in order to maintain her model, she's got to see a lot of clients to cover costs.
But Jennie doesn't have to spend a ton of time with each woman, if all of the members of her team can provide the support, information and care that her clients need.
The beauty of Jennie's model is that she actually believes it can be implemented in pretty much any health care setting.
It's a revolution in care just waiting to happen.
These problems I've been sharing with you are big.
They come from long histories of racism, classism, a society based on race and class stratification.
They involve elaborate physiological mechanisms meant to protect us, that, when overstimulated, actually make us sick.
But if there's one thing I've learned from my work as a doula, it's that a little bit of unconditional support can go a really long way.
History has shown that people are incredibly resilient, and while we can't eradicate racism or the stress that results from it overnight, we might just be able to create environments that provide a buffer to what people of color experience on a daily basis.
And during pregnancy, that buffer can be an incredible tool towards shifting the impact of racism for generations to come.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Five years ago, I had my dream job.
I was a foreign correspondent in the Middle East reporting for ABC News.
But there was a crack in the wall, a problem with our industry, that I felt we needed to fix.
You see, I got to the Middle East right around the end of 2007, which was just around the midpoint of the Iraq War.
But by the time I got there, it was already nearly impossible to find stories about Iraq on air.
Coverage had dropped across the board, across networks.
And of the stories that did make it, more than 80 percent of them were about us.
We were missing the stories about Iraq, the people who live there, and what was happening to them under the weight of the war.
Afghanistan had already fallen off the agenda.
There were less than one percent of all news stories in 2008 that went to the war in Afghanistan.
It was the longest war in US history, but information was so scarce that schoolteachers we spoke to told us they had trouble explaining to their students what we were doing there, when those students had parents who were fighting and sometimes dying overseas.
We had drawn a blank, and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.
From conflict zones to climate change to all sorts of issues around crises in public health, we were missing what I call the species-level issues, because as a species, they could actually sink us.
And by failing to understand the complex issues of our time, we were facing certain practical implications.
How were we going to solve problems that we didn't fundamentally understand, that we couldn't track in real time, and where the people working on the issues were invisible to us and sometimes invisible to each other?
When you look back on Iraq, those years when we were missing the story, were the years when the society was falling apart, when we were setting the conditions for what would become the rise of ISIS, the ISIS takeover of Mosul and terrorist violence that would spread beyond Iraq's borders to the rest of the world.
Just around that time where I was making that observation, I looked across the border of Iraq and noticed there was another story we were missing: the war in Syria.
If you were a Middle-East specialist, you knew that Syria was that important from the start.
But it ended up being, really, one of the forgotten stories of the Arab Spring.
I saw the implications up front.
Syria is intimately tied to regional security, to global stability.
I felt like we couldn't let that become another one of the stories we left behind.
So I left my big TV job to start a website, called "Syria Deeply." It was designed to be a news and information source that made it easier to understand a complex issue, and for the past four years, it's been a resource for policymakers and professionals working on the conflict in Syria.
We built a business model based on consistent, high-quality information, and convening the top minds on the issue.
And we found it was a model that scaled.
We got passionate requests to do other things "Deeply." So we started to work our way down the list.
I'm just one of many entrepreneurs, and we are just one of many start-ups trying to fix what's wrong with news.
All of us in the trenches know that something is wrong with the news industry. It's broken. Trust in the media has hit an all-time low.
And the statistic you're seeing up there is from September -- it's arguably gotten worse.
But we can fix this.
We can fix the news.
I know that that's true.
You can call me an idealist; I call myself an industrious optimist.
And I know there are a lot of us out there.
We have ideas for how to make things better, and I want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work.
Idea number one: we need news that's built on deep-domain knowledge.
Given the waves and waves of layoffs at newsrooms across the country, we've lost the art of specialization.
Beat reporting is an endangered thing.
When it comes to foreign news, the way we can fix that is by working with more local journalists, treating them like our partners and collaborators, not just fixers who fetch us phone numbers and sound bites.
Our local reporters in Syria and across Africa and across Asia bring us stories that we certainly would not have found on our own.
Like this one from the suburbs of Damascus, about a wheelchair race that gave hope to those wounded in the war.
Or this one from Sierra Leone, about a local chief who curbed the spread of Ebola by self-organizing a quarantine in his district.
Or this one from the border of Pakistan, about Afghan refugees being forced to return home before they are ready, under the threat of police intimidation.
Our local journalists are our mentors.
They teach us something new every day, and they bring us stories that are important for all of us to know.
Idea number two: we need a kind of Hippocratic oath for the news industry, a pledge to first do no harm.
(Applause)
Journalists need to be tough.
We need to speak truth to power, but we also need to be responsible.
We need to live up to our own ideals, and we need to recognize when what we're doing could potentially harm society, where we lose track of journalism as a public service.
I watched us cover the Ebola crisis.
We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.
But what we saw was a public that was flooded with hysterical and sensational coverage, sometimes inaccurate, sometimes completely wrong.
Public health experts tell me that that actually cost us in human lives, because by sparking more panic and by sometimes getting the facts wrong, we made it harder for people to resolve what was actually happening on the ground.
All that noise made it harder to make the right decisions.
We can do better as an industry, but it requires us recognizing how we got it wrong last time, and deciding not to go that way next time.
It's a choice.
We have to resist the temptation to use fear for ratings.
And that decision has to be made in the individual newsroom and with the individual news executive.
Because the next deadly virus that comes around could be much worse and the consequences much higher, if we do what we did last time; if our reporting isn't responsible and it isn't right.
The third idea? We need to embrace complexity if we want to make sense of a complex world. Embrace complexity --
(Applause)
not treat the world simplistically, because simple isn't accurate.
We live in a complex world.
News is adult education.
It's our job as journalists to get elbow deep in complexity and to find new ways to make it easier for everyone else to understand.
If we don't do that, if we pretend there are just simple answers, we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.
Understanding complexity is the only way to know the real threats that are around the corner.
It's our responsibility to translate those threats and to help you understand what's real, so you can be prepared and know what it takes to be ready for what comes next.
I am an industrious optimist.
I do believe we can fix what's broken.
We all want to.
There are great journalists out there doing great work -- we just need new formats.
I honestly believe this is a time of reawakening, reimagining what we can do.
I believe we can fix what's broken.
I know we can fix the news.
I know it's worth trying, and I truly believe that in the end, we're going to get this right.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in a place with no rules?
That sounds pretty cool.
(Laughter)
You wake up one morning, however, and you discover that the reason there are no rules is because there's no government, and there are no laws.
In fact, all social institutions have disappeared.
So there's no schools, there's no hospitals, there's no police, there's no banks, there's no athletic clubs, there's no utilities.
Well, I know a little bit about what this is like, because when I was a medical student in 1999, I worked in a refugee camp in the Balkans during the Kosovo War.
When the war was over, I got permission -- unbelievably -- from my medical school to take some time off and follow some of the families that I had befriended in the camp back to their village in Kosovo, and understand how they navigated life in this postwar setting.
Postwar Kosovo was a very interesting place because NATO troops were there, mostly to make sure the war didn't break out again.
But other than that, it was actually a lawless place, and almost every social institution, both public and private, had been destroyed.
So I can tell you that when you go into one of these situations and settings, it is absolutely thrilling ... for about 30 minutes, because that's about how long it takes before you run into a situation where you realize how incredibly vulnerable you are.
For me, that moment came when I had to cross the first checkpoint, and I realized as I drove up that I would be negotiating passage through this checkpoint with a heavily armed individual who, if he decided to shoot me right then and there, actually wouldn't be doing anything illegal.
But the sense of vulnerability that I had was absolutely nothing in comparison to the vulnerability of the families that I got to know over that year.
You see, life in a society where there are no social institutions is riddled with danger and uncertainty, and simple questions like, "What are we going to eat tonight?" are very complicated to answer.
Questions about security, when you don't have any security systems, are terrifying.
Is that altercation I had with the neighbor down the block going to turn into a violent episode that will end my life or my family's life?
Health concerns when there is no health system are also terrifying.
I listened as many families had to sort through questions like, "My infant has a fever. What am I going to do?" "My sister, who is pregnant, is bleeding. What should I do?
Who should I turn to?" "Where are the doctors, where are the nurses?
If I could find one, are they trustworthy?
How will I pay them? In what currency will I pay them?" "If I need medications, where will I find them?
If I take those medications, are they actually counterfeits?" And on and on.
So for life in these settings, the dominant theme, the dominant feature of life, is the incredible vulnerability that people have to manage day in and day out, because of the lack of social systems.
And it actually turns out that this feature of life is incredibly difficult to explain and be understood by people who are living outside of it.
I discovered this when I left Kosovo.
I came back to Boston, I became a physician, I became a global public health policy researcher.
I joined the Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital Division of Global Health.
And I, as a researcher, really wanted to get started on this problem right away.
I was like, "How do we reduce the crushing vulnerability of people living in these types of fragile settings?
Is there any way we can start to think about how to protect and quickly recover the institutions that are critical to survival, like the health system?" And I have to say, I had amazing colleagues.
But one interesting thing about it was, this was sort of an unusual question for them. They were kind of like, "Oh, if you work in war, doesn't that mean you work on refugee camps, and you work on documenting mass atrocities?" -- which is, by the way, very, very, very important.
So it took me a while to explain why I was so passionate about this issue, until about six years ago.
That's when this landmark study that looked at and described the public health consequences of war was published.
They came to an incredible, provocative conclusion.
These researchers concluded that the vast majority of death and disability from war happens after the cessation of conflict.
So the most dangerous time to be a person living in a conflict-affected state is after the cessation of hostilities; it's after the peace deal has been signed. It's when that political solution has been achieved.
That seems so puzzling, but of course it's not, because war kills people by robbing them of their clinics, of their hospitals, of their supply chains.
Their doctors are targeted, are killed; they're on the run.
And more invisible and yet more deadly is the destruction of the health governance institutions and their finances.
So this is really not surprising at all to me.
But what is surprising and somewhat dismaying, is how little impact this insight has had, in terms of how we think about human suffering and war.
Let me give you a couple examples.
Last year, you may remember, Ebola hit the West African country of Liberia.
There was a lot of reporting about this group, Doctors Without Borders, sounding the alarm and calling for aid and assistance.
But not a lot of that reporting answered the question: Why is Doctors Without Borders even in Liberia?
Doctors Without Borders is an amazing organization, dedicated and designed to provide emergency care in war zones.
Liberia's civil war had ended in 2003 -- that was 11 years before Ebola even struck.
When Ebola struck Liberia, there were less than 50 doctors in the entire country of 4.5 million people.
Doctors Without Borders is in Liberia because Liberia still doesn't really have a functioning health system, 11 years later.
When the earthquake hit Haiti in 2010, the outpouring of international aid was phenomenal.
But did you know that only two percent of that funding went to rebuild Haitian public institutions, including its health sector?
From that perspective, Haitians continue to die from the earthquake even today.
I recently met this gentleman.
This is Dr. Nezar Ismet.
He's the Minister of Health in the northern autonomous region of Iraq, in Kurdistan.
Here he is announcing that in the last nine months, his country, his region, has increased from four million people to five million people.
That's a 25 percent increase.
Thousands of these new arrivals have experienced incredible trauma.
His doctors are working 16-hour days without pay.
His budget has not increased by 25 percent; it has decreased by 20 percent, as funding has flowed to security concerns and to short-term relief efforts.
When his health sector fails -- and if history is any guide, it will -- how do you think that's going to influence the decision making of the five million people in his region as they think about whether they should flee that type of vulnerable living situation?
So as you can see, this is a frustrating topic for me, and I really try to understand: Why the reluctance to protect and support indigenous health systems and security systems?
I usually tier two concerns, two arguments.
The first concern is about corruption, and the concern that people in these settings are corrupt and they are untrustworthy.
And I will admit that I have met unsavory characters working in health sectors in these situations.
But I will tell you that the opposite is absolutely true in every case I have worked on, from Afghanistan to Libya, to Kosovo, to Haiti, to Liberia -- I have met inspiring people, who, when the chips were down for their country, they risked everything to save their health institutions.
The trick for the outsider who wants to help is identifying who those individuals are, and building a pathway for them to lead.
That is exactly what happened in Afghanistan.
One of the unsung and untold success stories of our nation-building effort in Afghanistan involved the World Bank in 2002 investing heavily in identifying, training and promoting Afghani health sector leaders.
These health sector leaders have pulled off an incredible feat in Afghanistan.
They have aggressively increased access to health care for the majority of the population.
They are rapidly improving the health status of the Afghan population, which used to be the worst in the world.
In fact, the Afghan Ministry of Health does things that I wish we would do in America.
They use things like data to make policy. It's incredible.
(Laughter)
The other concern I hear a lot about is: "We just can't afford it, we just don't have the money.
It's just unsustainable." I would submit to you that the current situation and the current system we have is the most expensive, inefficient system we could possibly conceive of.
The current situation is that when governments like the US -- or, let's say, the collection of governments that make up the European Commission -- every year, they spend 15 billion dollars on just humanitarian and emergency and disaster relief worldwide.
That's nothing about foreign aid, that's just disaster relief.
Ninety-five percent of it goes to international relief agencies, that then have to import resources into these areas, and knit together some type of temporary health system, let's say, which they then dismantle and send away when they run out of money.
So our job, it turns out, is very clear.
We, as the global health community policy experts, our first job is to become experts in how to monitor the strengths and vulnerabilities of health systems in threatened situations.
And that's when we see doctors fleeing, when we see health resources drying up, when we see institutions crumbling -- that's the emergency.
That's when we need to sound the alarm and wave our arms. OK? Not now. Everyone can see that's an emergency, they don't need us to tell them that.
Number two: places like where I work at Harvard need to take their cue from the World Bank experience in Afghanistan, and we need to -- and we will -- build robust platforms to support health sector leaders like these.
These people risk their lives.
I think we can match their courage with some support.
Number three: we need to reach out and make new partnerships.
At our global health center, we have launched a new initiative with NATO and other security policy makers to explore with them what they can do to protect health system institutions during deployments.
We want them to see that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions is an integral part of their mission.
It's not just about avoiding collateral damage; it's about winning the peace.
But the most important partner we need to engage is you, the American public, and indeed, the world public.
Because unless you understand the value of social institutions, like health systems in these fragile settings, you won't support efforts to save them.
You won't click on that article that talks about "Hey, all those doctors are on the run in country X. I wonder what that means.
I wonder what that means. for that health system's ability to, let's say, detect influenza." "Hmm, it's probably not good." That's what I'd tell you.
Up on the screen, I've put up my three favorite American institution defenders and builders.
Over here is George C. Marshall, he was the guy that proposed the Marshall Plan to save all of Europe's economic institutions after World War II.
And this Eleanor Roosevelt.
Her work on human rights really serves as the foundation for all of our international human rights organizations.
Then my big favorite is Ben Franklin, who did many things in terms of creating institutions, but was the midwife of our constitution.
And I would say to you that these are folks who, when our country was threatened, or our world was threatened, they didn't retreat.
They didn't talk about building walls.
They talked about building institutions to protect human security, for their generation and also for ours.
And I think our generation should do the same.
Thank you. (Applause)
When I was a kid, I was the quintessential nerd.
I think some of you were, too.
(Laughter)
And you, sir, who laughed the loudest, you probably still are.
(Laughter)
I grew up in a small town in the dusty plains of north Texas, the son of a sheriff who was the son of a pastor.
Getting into trouble was not an option.
And so I started reading calculus books for fun.
(Laughter)
You did, too. That led me to building a laser and a computer and model rockets, and that led me to making rocket fuel in my bedroom.
Now, in scientific terms, we call this a very bad idea.
(Laughter)
Around that same time, Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" came to the theaters, and my life was forever changed.
I loved everything about that movie, especially the HAL 9000.
Now, HAL was a sentient computer designed to guide the Discovery spacecraft from the Earth to Jupiter.
HAL was also a flawed character, for in the end he chose to value the mission over human life.
Now, HAL was a fictional character, but nonetheless he speaks to our fears, our fears of being subjugated by some unfeeling, artificial intelligence who is indifferent to our humanity.
I believe that such fears are unfounded.
Indeed, we stand at a remarkable time in human history, where, driven by refusal to accept the limits of our bodies and our minds, we are building machines of exquisite, beautiful complexity and grace that will extend the human experience in ways beyond our imagining.
After a career that led me from the Air Force Academy to Space Command to now, I became a systems engineer, and recently I was drawn into an engineering problem associated with NASA's mission to Mars.
Now, in space flights to the Moon, we can rely upon mission control in Houston to watch over all aspects of a flight. However, Mars is 200 times further away, and as a result it takes on average 13 minutes for a signal to travel from the Earth to Mars.
If there's trouble, there's not enough time.
And so a reasonable engineering solution calls for us to put mission control inside the walls of the Orion spacecraft.
Another fascinating idea in the mission profile places humanoid robots on the surface of Mars before the humans themselves arrive, first to build facilities and later to serve as collaborative members of the science team.
Now, as I looked at this from an engineering perspective, it became very clear to me that what I needed to architect was a smart, collaborative, socially intelligent artificial intelligence.
In other words, I needed to build something very much like a HAL but without the homicidal tendencies.
(Laughter)
Let's pause for a moment.
Is it really possible to build an artificial intelligence like that? Actually, it is. In many ways, this is a hard engineering problem with elements of AI, not some wet hair ball of an AI problem that needs to be engineered.
To paraphrase Alan Turing, I'm not interested in building a sentient machine.
I'm not building a HAL.
All I'm after is a simple brain, something that offers the illusion of intelligence.
The art and the science of computing have come a long way since HAL was onscreen, and I'd imagine if his inventor Dr. Chandra were here today, he'd have a whole lot of questions for us.
Is it really possible for us to take a system of millions upon millions of devices, to read in their data streams, to predict their failures and act in advance? Yes. Can we build systems that converse with humans in natural language? Yes. Can we build systems that recognize objects, identify emotions, emote themselves, play games and even read lips? Yes. Can we build a system that sets goals, that carries out plans against those goals and learns along the way? Yes. Can we build systems that have a theory of mind?
This we are learning to do.
Can we build systems that have an ethical and moral foundation?
This we must learn how to do.
So let's accept for a moment that it's possible to build such an artificial intelligence for this kind of mission and others.
The next question you must ask yourself is, should we fear it?
Now, every new technology brings with it some measure of trepidation.
When we first saw cars, people lamented that we would see the destruction of the family.
When we first saw telephones come in, people were worried it would destroy all civil conversation.
At a point in time we saw the written word become pervasive, people thought we would lose our ability to memorize.
These things are all true to a degree, but it's also the case that these technologies brought to us things that extended the human experience in some profound ways.
So let's take this a little further.
I do not fear the creation of an AI like this, because it will eventually embody some of our values.
Consider this: building a cognitive system is fundamentally different than building a traditional software-intensive system of the past.
We don't program them. We teach them. In order to teach a system how to recognize flowers, I show it thousands of flowers of the kinds I like.
In order to teach a system how to play a game — Well, I would.
You would, too. I like flowers. Come on. To teach a system how to play a game like Go, I'd have it play thousands of games of Go, but in the process I also teach it how to discern a good game from a bad game.
If I want to create an artificially intelligent legal assistant, I will teach it some corpus of law but at the same time I am fusing with it the sense of mercy and justice that is part of that law.
In scientific terms, this is what we call ground truth, and here's the important point: in producing these machines, we are therefore teaching them a sense of our values.
To that end, I trust an artificial intelligence the same, if not more, as a human who is well-trained.
But, you may ask, what about rogue agents, some well-funded nongovernment organization?
I do not fear an artificial intelligence in the hand of a lone wolf.
Clearly, we cannot protect ourselves against all random acts of violence, but the reality is such a system requires substantial training and subtle training far beyond the resources of an individual.
And furthermore, it's far more than just injecting an internet virus to the world, where you push a button, all of a sudden it's in a million places and laptops start blowing up all over the place.
Now, these kinds of substances are much larger, and we'll certainly see them coming.
Do I fear that such an artificial intelligence might threaten all of humanity?
If you look at movies such as "The Matrix," "Metropolis," "The Terminator," shows such as "Westworld," they all speak of this kind of fear.
Indeed, in the book "Superintelligence" by the philosopher Nick Bostrom, he picks up on this theme and observes that a superintelligence might not only be dangerous, it could represent an existential threat to all of humanity.
Dr. Bostrom's basic argument is that such systems will eventually have such an insatiable thirst for information that they will perhaps learn how to learn and eventually discover that they may have goals that are contrary to human needs.
Dr. Bostrom has a number of followers.
He is supported by people such as Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking.
With all due respect to these brilliant minds, I believe that they are fundamentally wrong.
Now, there are a lot of pieces of Dr. Bostrom's argument to unpack, and I don't have time to unpack them all, but very briefly, consider this: super knowing is very different than super doing.
HAL was a threat to the Discovery crew only insofar as HAL commanded all aspects of the Discovery.
So it would have to be with a superintelligence.
It would have to have dominion over all of our world.
This is the stuff of Skynet from the movie "The Terminator" in which we had a superintelligence that commanded human will, that directed every device that was in every corner of the world.
Practically speaking, it ain't gonna happen.
We are not building AIs that control the weather, that direct the tides, that command us capricious, chaotic humans.
And furthermore, if such an artificial intelligence existed, it would have to compete with human economies, and thereby compete for resources with us.
And in the end -- don't tell Siri this -- we can always unplug them.
(Laughter)
We are on an incredible journey of coevolution with our machines.
The humans we are today are not the humans we will be then.
To worry now about the rise of a superintelligence is in many ways a dangerous distraction because the rise of computing itself brings to us a number of human and societal issues to which we must now attend.
How shall I best organize society when the need for human labor diminishes?
How can I bring understanding and education throughout the globe and still respect our differences?
How might I extend and enhance human life through cognitive healthcare?
How might I use computing to help take us to the stars?
And that's the exciting thing.
The opportunities to use computing to advance the human experience are within our reach, here and now, and we are just beginning.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Hi, I'm an engineer and I make robots.
Now, of course you all know what a robot is, right?
If you don't, you'd probably go to Google, and you'd ask Google what a robot is.
So let's do that.
We'll go to Google and this is what we get.
Now, you can see here there are lots of different types of robots, but they're predominantly humanoid in structure.
And they look pretty conventional because they've got plastic, they've got metal, they've got motors and gears and so on.
Some of them look quite friendly, and you could go up and you could hug them.
Some of them not so friendly, they look like they're straight out of "Terminator," in fact they may well be straight out of "Terminator." You can do lots of really cool things with these robots -- you can do really exciting stuff.
But I'd like to look at different kinds of robots -- I want to make different kinds of robots. And I take inspiration from the things that don't look like us, but look like these.
So these are natural biological organisms and they do some really cool things that we can't, and current robots can't either.
They do all sorts of great things like moving around on the floor; they go into our gardens and they eat our crops; they climb trees; they go in water, they come out of water; they trap insects and digest them.
So they do really interesting things.
They live, they breathe, they die, they eat things from the environment.
Our current robots don't really do that.
Now, wouldn't it be great if you could use some of those characteristics in future robots so that you could solve some really interesting problems?
I'm going to look at a couple of problems now in the environment where we can use the skills and the technologies derived from these animals and from the plants, and we can use them to solve those problems.
Let's have a look at two environmental problems.
They're both of our making -- this is man interacting with the environment and doing some rather unpleasant things.
The first one is to do with the pressure of population.
Such is the pressure of population around the world that agriculture and farming is required to produce more and more crops.
Now, to do that, farmers put more and more chemicals onto the land.
They put on fertilizers, nitrates, pesticides -- all sorts of things that encourage the growth of the crops, but there are some negative impacts.
One of the negative impacts is if you put lots of fertilizer on the land, not all of it goes into the crops.
Lots of it stays in the soil, and then when it rains, these chemicals go into the water table.
And in the water table, then they go into streams, into lakes, into rivers and into the sea.
Now, if you put all of these chemicals, these nitrates, into those kinds of environments, there are organisms in those environments that will be affected by that -- algae, for example.
Algae loves nitrates, it loves fertilizer, so it will take in all these chemicals, and if the conditions are right, it will mass produce.
It will produce masses and masses of new algae.
That's called a bloom.
The trouble is that when algae reproduces like this, it starves the water of oxygen.
As soon as you do that, the other organisms in the water can't survive.
So, what do we do?
We try to produce a robot that will eat the algae, consume it and make it safe.
So that's the first problem.
The second problem is also of our making, and it's to do with oil pollution.
Now, oil comes out of the engines that we use, the boats that we use.
Sometimes tankers flush their oil tanks into the sea, so oil is released into the sea that way.
Wouldn't it be nice if we could treat that in some way using robots that could eat the pollution the oil fields have produced?
So that's what we do.
We make robots that will eat pollution.
To actually make the robot, we take inspiration from two organisms.
On the right there you see the basking shark.
The basking shark is a massive shark.
It's noncarnivorous, so you can swim with it, as you can see.
And the basking shark opens its mouth, and it swims through the water, collecting plankton.
As it does that, it digests the food, and then it uses that energy in its body to keep moving.
So, could we make a robot like that -- like the basking shark that chugs through the water and eats up pollution?
Well, let's see if we can do that.
But also, we take the inspiration from other organisms.
I've got a picture here of a water boatman, and the water boatman is really cute.
When it's swimming in the water, it uses its paddle-like legs to push itself forward.
So we take those two organisms and we combine them together to make a new kind of robot.
In fact, because we're using the water boatman as inspiration, and our robot sits on top of the water, and it rows, we call it the "Row-bot." So a Row-bot is a robot that rows. OK. So what does it look like?
Here's some pictures of the Row-bot, and you'll see, it doesn't look anything like the robots we saw right at the beginning.
Google is wrong; robots don't look like that, they look like this.
So I've got the Row-bot here.
I'll just hold it up for you. It gives you a sense of the scale, and it doesn't look anything like the others.
OK, so it's made out of plastic, and we'll have a look now at the components that make up the Row-bot -- what makes it really special.
The Row-bot is made up of three parts, and those three parts are really like the parts of any organism.
It's got a brain, it's got a body and it's got a stomach.
It needs the stomach to create the energy.
Any Row-bot will have those three components, and any organism will have those three components, so let's go through them one at a time.
It has a body, and its body is made out of plastic, and it sits on top of the water.
And it's got flippers on the side here -- paddles that help it move, just like the water boatman.
It's got a plastic body, but it's got a soft rubber mouth here, and a mouth here -- it's got two mouths.
Why does it have two mouths?
One is to let the food go in and the other is to let the food go out.
So you can see really it's got a mouth and a derriere, or a — (Laughter) something where the stuff comes out, which is just like a real organism.
So it's starting to look like that basking shark.
So that's the body.
The second component might be the stomach.
We need to get the energy into the robot and we need to treat the pollution, so the pollution goes in, and it will do something.
It's got a cell in the middle here called a microbial fuel cell.
I'll put this down, and I'll lift up the fuel cell. Here. So instead of having batteries, instead of having a conventional power system, it's got one of these.
This is its stomach.
And it really is a stomach because you can put energy in this side in the form of pollution, and it creates electricity. So what is it? It's called a microbial fuel cell.
It's a little bit like a chemical fuel cell, which you might have come across in school, or you might've seen in the news.
Chemical fuel cells take hydrogen and oxygen, and they can combine them together and you get electricity.
That's well-established technology; it was in the Apollo space missions.
That's from 40, 50 years ago.
This is slightly newer.
This is a microbial fuel cell.
It's the same principle: it's got oxygen on one side, but instead of having hydrogen on the other, it's got some soup, and inside that soup there are living microbes.
Now, if you take some organic material -- could be some waste products, some food, maybe a bit of your sandwich -- you put it in there, the microbes will eat that food, and they will turn it into electricity.
Not only that, but if you select the right kind of microbes, you can use the microbial fuel cell to treat some of the pollution.
If you choose the right microbes, the microbes will eat the algae.
If you use other kinds of microbes, they will eat petroleum spirits and crude oil.
So you can see how this stomach could be used to not only treat the pollution but also to generate electricity from the pollution.
So the robot will move through the environment, taking food into its stomach, digest the food, create electricity, use that electricity to move through the environment and keep doing this.
OK, so let's see what happens when we run the Row-bot -- when it does some rowing.
Here we've got a couple of videos, the first thing you'll see -- hopefully you can see here is the mouth open.
The front mouth and the bottom mouth open, and it will stay opened enough, then the robot will start to row forward.
It moves through the water so that food goes in as the waste products go out.
Once it's moved enough, it stops and then it closes the mouth -- slowly closes the mouths -- and then it will sit there, and it will digest the food.
Of course these microbial fuel cells, they contain microbes.
What you really want is lots of energy coming out of those microbes as quickly as possible.
But we can't force the microbes and they generate a small amount of electricity per second.
They generate milliwatts, or microwatts.
Let's put that into context.
Your mobile phone for example, one of these modern ones, if you use it, it takes about one watt.
So that's a thousand or a million times as much energy that that uses compared to the microbial fuel cell.
How can we cope with that?
Well, when the Row-bot has done its digestion, when it's taken the food in, it will sit there and it will wait until it has consumed all that food.
That could take some hours, it could take some days.
A typical cycle for the Row-bot looks like this: you open your mouth, you move, you close your mouth and you sit there for a while waiting.
Once you digest your food, then you can go about doing the same thing again.
But you know what, that looks like a real organism, doesn't it?
It looks like the kind of thing we do.
Saturday night, we go out, open our mouths, fill our stomachs, sit in front of the telly and digest.
When we've had enough, we do the same thing again.
OK, if we're lucky with this cycle, at the end of the cycle we'll have enough energy left over for us to be able to do something else.
We could send a message, for example.
We could send a message saying, "This is how much pollution I've eaten recently," or, "This is the kind of stuff that I've encountered," or, "This is where I am." That ability to send a message saying, "This is where I am," is really, really important.
If you think about the oil slicks that we saw before, or those massive algal blooms, what you really want to do is put your Row-bot out there, and it eats up all of those pollutions, and then you have to go collect them. Why? Because these Row-bots at the moment, this Row-bot I've got here, it contains motors, it contains wires, it contains components which themselves are not biodegradable.
Current Row-bots contain things like toxic batteries.
You can't leave those in the environment, so you need to track them, and then when they've finished their job of work, you need to collect them.
That limits the number of Row-bots you can use.
If, on the other hand, you have robot a little bit like a biological organism, when it comes to the end of its life, it dies and it degrades to nothing.
So wouldn't it be nice if these robots, instead of being like this, made out of plastic, were made out of other materials, which when you throw them out there, they biodegrade to nothing?
That changes the way in which we use robots.
Instead of putting 10 or 100 out into the environment, having to track them, and then when they die, collect them, you could put a thousand, a million, a billion robots into the environment.
Just spread them around.
You know that at the end of their lives, they're going to degrade to nothing.
You don't need to worry about them.
So that changes the way in which you think about robots and the way you deploy them.
Then the question is: Can you do this?
Well, yes, we have shown that you can do this.
You can make robots which are biodegradable.
What's really interesting is you can use household materials to make these biodegradable robots.
I'll show you some; you might be surprised.
You can make a robot out of jelly.
Instead of having a motor, which we have at the moment, you can make things called artificial muscles.
Artificial muscles are smart materials, you apply electricity to them, and they contract, or they bend or they twist.
They look like real muscles.
So instead of having a motor, you have these artificial muscles.
And you can make artificial muscles out of jelly.
If you take some jelly and some salts, and do a bit of jiggery-pokery, you can make an artificial muscle.
We've also shown you can make the microbial fuel cell's stomach out of paper.
So you could make the whole robot out of biodegradable materials.
You throw them out there, and they degrade to nothing.
Well, this is really, really exciting.
It's going to totally change the way in which we think about robots, but also it allows you to be really creative in the way in which you think about what you can do with these robots.
I'll give you an example.
If you can use jelly to make a robot -- now, we eat jelly, right?
So, why not make something like this?
A robot gummy bear.
Here, I've got some I prepared earlier. There we go. I've got a packet -- and I've got a lemon-flavored one.
I'll take this gummy bear -- he's not robotic, OK? We have to pretend.
And what you do with one of these is you put it in your mouth -- the lemon's quite nice.
Try not to chew it too much, it's a robot, it may not like it. And then you swallow it.
And then it goes into your stomach.
And when it's inside your stomach, it moves, it thinks, it twists, it bends, it does something.
It could go further down into your intestines, find out whether you've got some ulcer or cancer, maybe do an injection, something like that.
You know that once it's done its job of work, it could be consumed by your stomach, or if you don't want that, it could go straight through you, into the toilet, and be degraded safely in the environment.
So this changes the way, again, in which we think about robots.
So, we started off looking at robots that would eat pollution, and then we're looking at robots which we can eat.
I hope this gives you some idea of the kinds of things we can do with future robots.
Thank you very much for your attention. (Applause)
What if I told you that time has a race, a race in the contemporary way that we understand race in the United States?
Typically, we talk about race in terms of black and white issues.
In the African-American communities from which I come, we have a long-standing multi-generational joke about what we call "CP time," or "colored people's time." Now, we no longer refer to African-Americans as "colored," but this long-standing joke about our perpetual lateness to church, to cookouts, to family events and even to our own funerals, remains.
I personally am a stickler for time.
It's almost as if my mother, when I was growing up, said, "We will not be those black people." So we typically arrive to events 30 minutes early.
But today, I want to talk to you more about the political nature of time, for if time had a race, it would be white.
White people own time.
I know, I know.
Making such "incendiary statements" makes us uncomfortable: Haven't we moved past the point where race really matters?
Isn't race a heavy-handed concept?
Shouldn't we go ahead with our enlightened, progressive selves and relegate useless concepts like race to the dustbins of history?
How will we ever get over racism if we keep on talking about race?
Perhaps we should lock up our concepts of race in a time capsule, bury them and dig them up in a thousand years, peer at them with the clearly more enlightened, raceless versions of ourselves that belong to the future.
But you see there, that desire to mitigate the impact of race and racism shows up in how we attempt to manage time, in the ways we narrate history, in the ways we attempt to shove the negative truths of the present into the past, in the ways we attempt to argue that the future that we hope for is the present in which we're currently living.
Now, when Barack Obama became President of the US in 2008, many Americans declared that we were post-racial.
I'm from the academy where we're enamored with being post-everything.
We're postmodern, we're post-structural, we're post-feminist. "Post" has become a simple academic appendage that we apply to a range of terms to mark the way we were.
But prefixes alone don't have the power to make race and racism a thing of the past.
The US was never "pre-race." So to claim that we're post-race when we have yet to grapple with the impact of race on black people, Latinos or the indigenous is disingenuous.
Just about the moment we were preparing to celebrate our post-racial future, our political conditions became the most racial they've been in the last 50 years.
So today, I want to offer to you three observations, about the past, the present and the future of time, as it relates to the combating of racism and white dominance.
First: the past. Time has a history, and so do black people.
But we treat time as though it is timeless, as though it has always been this way, as though it doesn't have a political history bound up with the plunder of indigenous lands, the genocide of indigenous people and the stealing of Africans from their homeland.
When white male European philosophers first thought to conceptualize time and history, one famously declared, "[Africa] is no historical part of the World." He was essentially saying that Africans were people outside of history who had had no impact on time or the march of progress.
This idea, that black people have had no impact on history, is one of the foundational ideas of white supremacy.
It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson created "Negro History Week" in 1926. It's the reason that we continue to celebrate Black History Month in the US every February.
Now, we also see this idea that black people are people either alternately outside of the bounds of time or stuck in the past, in a scenario where, much as I'm doing right now, a black person stands up and insists that racism still matters, and a person, usually white, says to them, "Why are you stuck in the past?
Why can't you move on?
We have a black president.
We're past all that."
William Faulkner famously said, "The past is never dead.
It's not even past." But my good friend Professor Kristie Dotson says, "Our memory is longer than our lifespan." We carry, all of us, family and communal hopes and dreams with us.
We don't have the luxury of letting go of the past.
But sometimes, our political conditions are so troubling that we don't know if we're living in the past or we're living in the present.
Take, for instance, when Black Lives Matter protesters go out to protest unjust killings of black citizens by police, and the pictures that emerge from the protest look like they could have been taken 50 years ago.
The past won't let us go.
But still, let us press our way into the present.
At present, I would argue that the racial struggles we are experiencing are clashes over time and space.
What do I mean?
Well, I've already told you that white people own time.
Those in power dictate the pace of the workday.
They dictate how much money our time is actually worth.
And Professor George Lipsitz argues that white people even dictate the pace of social inclusion.
They dictate how long it will actually take for minority groups to receive the rights that they have been fighting for.
Let me loop back to the past quickly to give you an example.
If you think about the Civil Rights Movement and the cries of its leaders for "Freedom Now," they were challenging the slow pace of white social inclusion.
By 1965, the year the Voting Rights Act was passed, there had been a full 100 years between the end of the Civil War and the conferral of voting rights on African-American communities.
Despite the urgency of a war, it still took a full 100 years for actual social inclusion to occur.
Since 2012, conservative state legislatures across the US have ramped up attempts to roll back African-American voting rights by passing restrictive voter ID laws and curtailing early voting opportunities.
This past July, a federal court struck down North Carolina's voter ID law saying it "... targeted African-Americans with surgical precision."
Restricting African-American inclusion in the body politic is a primary way that we attempt to manage and control people by managing and controlling time.
But another place that we see these time-space clashes is in gentrifying cities like Atlanta, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, New Orleans and Washington, DC -- places that have had black populations for generations.
But now, in the name of urban renewal and progress, these communities are pushed out, in service of bringing them into the 21st century.
Professor Sharon Holland asked: What happens when a person who exists in time meets someone who only occupies space?
These racial struggles are battles over those who are perceived to be space-takers and those who are perceived to be world-makers.
Those who control the flow and thrust of history are considered world-makers who own and master time.
In other words: white people.
But when Hegel famously said that Africa was no historical part of the world, he implied that it was merely a voluminous land mass taking up space at the bottom of the globe. Africans were space-takers. So today, white people continue to control the flow and thrust of history, while too often treating black people as though we are merely taking up space to which we are not entitled.
in service of bringing them into the 21st century. Time and the march of progress is used to justify a stunning degree of violence towards our most vulnerable populations, who, being perceived as space-takers rather than world-makers, are moved out of the places where they live,
Shortened life span according to zip code is just one example of the ways that time and space cohere in an unjust manner in the lives of black people.
Children who are born in New Orleans zip code 70124, which is 93 percent white, can expect to live a full 25 years longer than children born in New Orleans zip code 70112, which is 60 percent black.
Children born in Washington, DC's wealthy Maryland suburbs can expect to live a full 20 years longer than children born in its downtown neighborhoods.
Ta-Nehisi Coates argues that, "The defining feature of being drafted into the Black race is the inescapable robbery of time." We experience time discrimination, he tells us, not just as structural, but as personal: in lost moments of joy, lost moments of connection, lost quality of time with loved ones and lost years of healthy quality of life.
In the future, do you see black people?
Do black people have a future?
What if you belong to the very race of people who have always been pitted against time?
What if your group is the group for whom a future was never imagined?
These time-space clashes -- between protesters and police, between gentrifiers and residents -- don't paint a very pretty picture of what America hopes for black people's future.
If the present is any indicator, our children will be under-educated, health maladies will take their toll and housing will continue to be unaffordable.
So if we're really ready to talk about the future, perhaps we should begin by admitting that we're out of time.
We black people have always been out of time.
Time does not belong to us.
Our lives are lives of perpetual urgency.
Time is used to displace us, or conversely, we are urged into complacency through endless calls to just be patient.
But if past is prologue, let us seize upon the ways in which we're always out of time anyway to demand with urgency freedom now.
I believe the future is what we make it.
But first, we have to decide that time belongs to all of us.
No, we don't all get equal time, but we can decide that the time we do get is just and free.
We can stop making your zip code the primary determinant of your lifespan.
We can stop stealing learning time from black children through excessive use of suspensions and expulsions.
We can stop stealing time from black people through long periods of incarceration for nonviolent crimes.
The police can stop stealing time and black lives through use of excessive force.
I believe the future is what we make it.
But we can't get there on colored people's time or white time or your time or even my time.
It's our time. Ours.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Twenty-eight years ago, I was a broken man.
And you probably wouldn't be able to tell that if you met me.
I had a good job at a well-respected academic institution.
I dressed well, of course.
But my insides were rotting away.
You see, I grew up in a family riddled with addiction, and as a kid, I also struggled with coming to terms with my own sexuality.
And even though I couldn't name it then, growing up as a gay kid just compounded my issues of isolation and insecurities.
But drinking took all of that away.
Like many, I drank at an early age.
I continued to drink my way through college.
And when I finally did come out in the early 1980s, about the only places to meet other gay people, to socialize, to be yourself, were gay bars.
And what do you do in gay bars? You drink. And I did -- a lot.
My story is not unique.
Like millions of Americans, my disease progressed undiagnosed. It took me to people and places and things that I never would have chosen.
It wasn't until an intersection with the law gave me an "opportunity" to get care, that I began my journey of recovery.
My journey of recovery has been filled with love and with joy, but it hasn't been without pain.
Like many of you, I've lost too many friends and family to this disease.
I've heard too many heartbreaking stories of people who've lost loved ones to addiction.
And I've also lost countless friends to HIV and AIDS.
Our current opioid epidemic and the AIDS epidemic tragically have much in common.
Right now, we are in the midst of one of the greatest health crises of our time.
During 2014 alone, 28,000 people died of drug overdoses associated with prescription drugs and heroin.
During the 1980s, scores of people were dying from HIV and AIDS.
Public officials ignored it.
Some wouldn't even utter the words.
They didn't want treatment.
And tragically, there are many parallels with our current epidemic.
Some called it the gay plague.
They called for quarantines.
They wanted to separate the innocent victims from the rest of us.
I was afraid we were losing this battle because people were blaming us for being sick.
Public policy was being held hostage by stigma and fear, and also held hostage were compassion, care, research, recovery and treatment.
But we changed all that. Because out of the pain of those deaths, we saw a social and political movement.
AIDS galvanized us into action; to stand up, to speak up and to act out.
And it also galvanized the LGBT movement.
We knew we were in a battle for our lives because silence equaled death, but we changed, and we made things happen.
And right now, we have the potential to see the end of HIV / AIDS in our lifetime.
These changes came in no small part by the courageous, yet simple decision for people to come out to their neighbors, to their friends, to their families and to their coworkers.
Years ago, I was a volunteer for the Names Project.
This was an effort started by Cleve Jones in San Francisco to show that people who died of AIDS had names and faces and families and people who loved them.
I still recall unfolding the AIDS memorial quilt on the National Mall on a brilliant day in October, 1988.
So fast forward to 2015.
The Supreme Court's decision to strike down the ban on same-sex marriage.
My husband, Dave, and I walk over to the steps of the Supreme Court to celebrate that decision with so many other people, and I couldn't help but think how far we came around LGBT rights and yet how far we needed to go around issues of addiction.
When I was nominated by President Obama to be his Director of Drug Policy, I was very open about my recovery and about the fact that I was a gay man.
And at no point during my confirmation process -- at least that I know of -- did the fact that I was a gay man come to bear on my candidacy or my fitness to do this job.
But my addiction did.
At one point, a congressional staffer said that there was no way that I was going to be confirmed by the United States Senate because of my past, despite the fact that I had been in recovery for over 20 years, and despite the fact that this job takes a little bit of knowledge around addiction.
(Laughter)
So, you know, this is the stigma that people with substance use disorders face every single day, and you know, I have to tell you it's still why I'm more comfortable coming out as a gay man than I am as a person with a history of addiction.
Nearly every family in America is affected by addiction.
Yet, unfortunately, too often, it's not talked about openly and honestly.
It's whispered about.
It's met with derision and scorn.
We hear these stories, time and time again, on TV, online, we hear it from public officials, and we hear it from family and friends.
And those of us with an addiction, we hear those voices, and somehow we believe that we are less deserving of care and treatment.
Today in the United States, only one in nine people get care and treatment for their disorder. One in nine. Think about that.
Generally, people with other diseases get care and treatment.
If you have cancer, you get treatment, if you have diabetes, you get treatment.
If you have a heart attack, you get emergency services, and you get referred to care.
But somehow people with addiction have to wait for treatment or often can't get when they need it.
And left untreated, addiction has significant, dire consequences.
And for many people that means death or incarceration.
We've been down that road before.
For too long our country felt like we could arrest our way out of this problem.
But we know that we can't.
Decades of scientific research has shown that this is a medical issue -- that this is a chronic medical condition that people inherit and that people develop.
So the Obama administration has taken a different tack on drug policy.
We've developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to expand prevention services, treatment services, early intervention and recovery support.
We've pushed criminal justice reform. We've knocked down barriers to give people second chances.
We see public health and public safety officials working hand in hand at the community level.
We see police chiefs across the country guiding people to treatment instead of jail and incarceration.
We see law enforcement and other first responders reversing overdoses with naloxone to give people a second chance for care.
The Affordable Care Act is the biggest expansion of substance use disorder treatment in a generation, and it also calls for the integration of treatment services within primary care.
But fundamentally, all of this work is not enough.
Unless we change the way that we view people with addiction in the United States.
Years ago when I finally understood that I had a problem and I knew that I needed help, I was too afraid to ask for it.
I felt that people would think I was stupid, that I was weak-willed, that I was morally flawed.
But I talk about my recovery because I want to make change.
I want us to see that we need to be open and candid about who we are and what we can do.
I am public about my own recovery not to be self-congratulatory.
I am open about my own recovery to change public opinion, to change public policy and to change the course of this epidemic and empower the millions of Americans who struggle with this journey to be open and candid about who they are.
People are more than their disease.
And all of us have the opportunity to change public opinion and to change public policy.
All of us know someone who has an addiction, and all of us can do our part to change how we view people with addiction in the United States.
So when you see someone with an addiction, don't think of a drunk or a junkie or an addict or an abuser -- see a person; offer them help; give them kindness and compassion.
And together, we can be part of a growing movement in the United States to change how we view people with addiction.
Together we can change public policy.
We can ensure that people get care when they need it, just like any other disease.
We can be part of a growing, unstoppable movement to have millions of Americans enter recovery, and put an end to this epidemic.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Today, I want to tell you about a pressing social issue.
Now, it's not nuclear arms, it's not immigration, and it's not malaria.
I'm here to talk about movies.
Now, in all seriousness, movies are actually really important.
In film, we can be wildly entertained, and we can also be transported through storytelling.
Storytelling is so important.
Stories tell us what societies value, they offer us lessons, and they share and preserve our history. Stories are amazing.
But stories don't give everyone the same opportunity to appear within them, particularly not stories compartmentalized in the form of American movies.
In film, interestingly enough, females are still erased and marginalized in a lot of our stories.
And I learned this for the first time about 10 years ago when I did my first study on gender role in G-rated films.
Since then, we've conducted more than 30 investigations.
My team is tired.
And I've committed my life as researcher and activist to fighting the inclusion crisis in Hollywood.
So today, what I'd like to do is tell you about that crisis. I want to talk about gender inequality in film. I want to tell you how it is perpetuated, and then I'm going to tell you how we're going to fix it.
However, one caveat before I begin: my data are really depressing.
So I want to apologize in advance, because I'm going to put you all in a really bad mood.
But I'm going to bring it up at the end, and I'm going to present a silver lining to fix this mess that we've been in for a very, very long time.
So, let's start with the gravity of the situation.
Each year, my research team examines the top 100 grossing films in the United States.
What we do is we look at every speaking or named character on-screen.
Now, to count in one of my investigations, all a character has to do is say one word.
This is a very low bar.
(Laughter)
Thus far, we've looked at 800 movies, from 2007 to 2015, cataloguing every speaking character on-screen for gender, race, ethnicity, LGBT and characters with a disability.
Let's take a look at really some problematic trends.
First, females are still noticeably absent on-screen in film.
Across 800 movies and 35,205 speaking characters, less than a third of all roles go to girls and women.
Less than a third!
There's been no change from 2007 to 2015, and if you compare our results to a small sample of films from 1946 to 1955, there's been no change in over a half of a century.
Over half of a century!
But we're half of the population.
Now, if we look at this data intersectionally, which has been a focus of today, the picture becomes even more problematic.
Across the top 100 films of just last year, 48 films didn't feature one black or African-American speaking character, not one.
70 films were devoid of Asian or Asian-American speaking characters that were girls or women. None. Eighty-four films didn't feature one female character that had a disability.
And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual or transgender female speaking characters.
This is not underrepresentation. This is erasure, and I call this the epidemic of invisibility.
Now, when we move from prevalence to protagonist, the story is still problematic.
Out of a hundred films last year, only 32 featured a female lead or colead driving the action.
Only three out of a hundred films featured an underrepresented female driving the story, and only one diverse woman that was 45 years of age or older at the time of theatrical release.
Now let's look at portrayal. In addition to the numbers you just saw, females are far more likely to be sexualized in film than their male counterparts.
Matter of fact, they're about three times as likely to be shown in sexually revealing clothing, partially naked, and they're far more likely to be thin.
Now, sometimes, in animation, females are so thin that their waist size approximates the circumference of their upper arm.
(Laughter)
We like to say that these gals have no room for a womb or any other internal organ.
(Laughter)
Now, all joking aside, theories suggest, research confirms, exposure to thin ideals and objectifying content can lead to body dissatisfaction, internalization of the thin ideal and self-objectification among some female viewers.
Obviously, what we see on-screen and what we see in the world, they do not match. They do not match! Matter of fact, if we lived in the screen world, we would have a population crisis on our hands.
So, as soon as I recognized these patterns, I wanted to find out why, and it turns out that there are two drivers to inequality on-screen: content creator gender and misperceptions of the audience. Let's unpack them really quick.
If you want to change any of the patterns I just talked about, all you have to do is hire female directors.
Turns out, the female directors are associated with, in terms of short films and indie films, more girls and women on-screen, more stories with women in the center, more stories with women 40 years of age or older on-screen, which I think is good news for this crowd. More underrepresented —
(Laughter)
Sorry.
(Laughter)
Sorry but not sorry. More underrepresented characters in terms of race and ethnicity, and most importantly, more women working behind the camera in key production roles.
Easy answer to the problems that we just talked about. Or is it? It's actually not. 800 films, 2007-2015, 886 directors. Only 4.1 percent are women.
Only three are African-American or black, and only one woman was Asian.
So why is it so difficult to have female directors if they're part of the solution?
Well, to answer this question, we conducted a study.
We interviewed dozens of industry insiders and asked them about directors.
Turns out, both male and female executives, when they think director, they think male.
They perceive the traits of leadership to be masculine in nature.
So when they're going to hire a director to command a crew, lead a ship, be a visionary or be General Patton, all the things that we've heard -- their thoughts and ideations pull male.
The perception of director or a leader is inconsistent with the perception of a woman.
The roles are incongruous, which is consistent with a lot of research in the psychological arena.
Second factor contributing to inequality on-screen is misperceptions of the audience.
I don't need to tell this crowd: 50 percent of the people that go to the box office and buy tickets are girls and women in this country. Right? But we're not perceived to be a viable or financially lucrative target audience.
Further, there's some misperceptions about whether females can open a film.
Open a film means that if you place a female at the center, it doesn't have the return on investment that if you place a male at the center of a story does.
This misperception is actually costly. Right? Especially in the wake of franchise successes like "The Hunger Games," "Pitch Perfect" or that small little indie film, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens." Our own economic analyses show that gender of the lead character doesn't play a role in economic success in the United States. But what does? Production costs alone or in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country.
It's not the gender of the lead character.
So at this point, we should all be sufficiently depressed.
No change in 50 years, few female directors working behind the camera and the entertainment industry does not trust us as an audience.
Well, I told you there would be a silver lining, and there is.
There are actually simple and tangible solutions to fixing this problem that involve content creators, executives and consumers like the individuals in this room.
Let's talk about a few of them.
The first is what I call "just add five." Did you know if we looked at the top 100 films next year and simply added five female speaking characters on-screen to each of those films, it would create a new norm.
If we were to do this for three contiguous years, we would be at gender parity for the first time in over a half of a century.
Now, this approach is advantageous for a variety of reasons. One? It doesn't take away jobs for male actors. Heaven forbid.
(Laughter)
Two, it's actually cost-effective. It doesn't cost that much.
Three, it builds a pipeline for talent.
And four, it humanizes the production process. Why? Because it makes sure that there's women on set.
Second solution is for A-list talent.
A-listers, as we all know, can make demands in their contracts, particularly the ones that work on the biggest Hollywood films.
What if those A-listers simply added an equity clause or an inclusion rider into their contract?
Now, what does that mean?
Well, you probably don't know but the typical feature film has about 40 to 45 speaking characters in it.
I would argue that only 8 to 10 of those characters are actually relevant to the story.
Except maybe "Avengers." Right?
A few more in "Avengers." The remaining 30 or so roles, there's no reason why those minor roles can't match or reflect the demography of where the story is taking place.
An equity rider by an A-lister in their contract can stipulate that those roles reflect the world in which we actually live.
Now, there's no reason why a network, a studio or a production company cannot adopt the same contractual language in their negotiation processes.
Third solution: this would be for the entertainment industry, Hollywood in particular, to adopt the Rooney Rule when it comes to hiring practices around directors.
Now, in the NFL, the Rooney Rule stipulates that if a team wants to hire a coach from outside the organization, what they have to do is interview an underrepresented candidate.
The exact same principle can apply to Hollywood films. How? Well, on these top films, executives and agents can make sure that women and people of color are not only on the consideration list, but they're actually interviewed for the job.
Now, one might say, why is this important?
Because it exposes or introduces executives to female directors who otherwise fall prey to exclusionary hiring practices.
The fourth solution is for consumers like me and you.
If we want to see more films by, for and about women, we have to support them.
It may mean going to the independent theater chain instead of the multiplex.
Or it might mean scrolling down a little further online to find a film by a female director.
Or it may be writing a check and funding a film, particularly by a female director from an underrepresented background. Right? We need to write, call and email companies that are making and distributing films, and we need to post on our social media accounts when we want to see inclusive representation, women on-screen, and most importantly, women behind the camera.
We need to make our voices heard and our dollars count.
Now, we actually have the ability to change the world on this one.
The US and its content, films in particular, have captured the imaginations of audiences worldwide. Worldwide. So that means that the film industry has unprecedented access to be able to distribute stories about equality all around the world.
Imagine what would happen if the film industry aligned its values with what it shows on-screen.
It could foster inclusion and acceptance for girls and women, people of color, the LGBT community, individuals with disabilities, and so many more around the world.
The only thing that the film industry has to do is unleash its secret weapon, and that's storytelling.
Now, at the beginning of this talk, I said that films -- that they can actually transport us, but I would like to argue that films, they can transform us.
None of us in this room have grown up or experienced a storytelling landscape with fully realized female characters, none of us, because the numbers haven't changed.
What would happen if the next generation of audiences grew up with a whole different screen reality? What would happen? Well I'm here to tell you today that it's not only possible to change what we see on-screen but I am impatient for it to get here.
So let's agree to take action today to eradicate the epidemic of invisibility.
And let's agree to take action today to agree that US audiences and global viewers demand and deserve more.
And let's agree today that the next generation of viewers and audiences, that they deserve to see the stories we were never able to see.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Hello. Welcome to this TED Dialogues. It's the first of a series that's going to be done in response to the current political upheaval.
I don't know about you; I've become quite concerned about the growing divisiveness in this country and in the world.
No one's listening to each other. Right? They aren't. I mean, it feels like we need a different kind of conversation, one that's based on -- I don't know, on reason, listening, on understanding, on a broader context.
That's at least what we're going to try in these TED Dialogues, starting today.
And we couldn't have anyone with us who I'd be more excited to kick this off.
This is a mind right here that thinks pretty much like no one else on the planet, I would hasten to say. I'm serious.
I'm serious. (Yuval Noah Harari laughs)
He synthesizes history with underlying ideas in a way that kind of takes your breath away.
So, some of you will know this book, "Sapiens." Has anyone here read "Sapiens"?
(Applause) I mean, I could not put it down.
The way that he tells the story of mankind through big ideas that really make you think differently -- it's kind of amazing.
And here's the follow-up, which I think is being published in the US next week.
YNH: Yeah, next week.
CA: "Homo Deus." Now, this is the history of the next hundred years.
I've had a chance to read it.
It's extremely dramatic, and I daresay, for some people, quite alarming. It's a must-read. And honestly, we couldn't have someone better to help make sense of what on Earth is happening in the world right now.
So a warm welcome, please, to Yuval Noah Harari.
(Applause)
It's great to be joined by our friends on Facebook and around the Web. Hello, Facebook. And all of you, as I start asking questions of Yuval, come up with your own questions, and not necessarily about the political scandal du jour, but about the broader understanding of: Where are we heading? You ready? OK, we're going to go.
So here we are, Yuval: New York City, 2017, there's a new president in power, and shock waves rippling around the world.
What on Earth is happening?
YNH: I think the basic thing that happened is that we have lost our story.
Humans think in stories, and we try to make sense of the world by telling stories.
And for the last few decades, we had a very simple and very attractive story about what's happening in the world.
And the story said that, oh, what's happening is that the economy is being globalized, politics is being liberalized, and the combination of the two will create paradise on Earth, and we just need to keep on globalizing the economy and liberalizing the political system, and everything will be wonderful.
And 2016 is the moment when a very large segment, even of the Western world, stopped believing in this story. For good or bad reasons -- it doesn't matter.
People stopped believing in the story, and when you don't have a story, you don't understand what's happening.
CA: Part of you believes that that story was actually a very effective story. It worked.
YNH: To some extent, yes.
According to some measurements, we are now in the best time ever for humankind.
Today, for the first time in history, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little, which is an amazing achievement.
(Laughter)
Also for the first time in history, more people die from old age than from infectious diseases, and violence is also down.
For the first time in history, more people commit suicide than are killed by crime and terrorism and war put together.
Statistically, you are your own worst enemy.
At least, of all the people in the world, you are most likely to be killed by yourself —
(Laughter)
which is, again, very good news, compared --
(Laughter)
compared to the level of violence that we saw in previous eras.
CA: But this process of connecting the world ended up with a large group of people kind of feeling left out, and they've reacted.
And so we have this bombshell that's sort of ripping through the whole system.
I mean, what do you make of what's happened?
It feels like the old way that people thought of politics, the left-right divide, has been blown up and replaced.
How should we think of this?
YNH: Yeah, the old 20th-century political model of left versus right is now largely irrelevant, and the real divide today is between global and national, global or local.
And you see it again all over the world that this is now the main struggle.
We probably need completely new political models and completely new ways of thinking about politics.
In essence, what you can say is that we now have global ecology, we have a global economy but we have national politics, and this doesn't work together.
This makes the political system ineffective, because it has no control over the forces that shape our life.
And you have basically two solutions to this imbalance: either de-globalize the economy and turn it back into a national economy, or globalize the political system.
CA: So some, I guess many liberals out there view Trump and his government as kind of irredeemably bad, just awful in every way.
Do you see any underlying narrative or political philosophy in there that is at least worth understanding?
How would you articulate that philosophy?
Is it just the philosophy of nationalism?
YNH: I think the underlying feeling or idea is that the political system — something is broken there.
It doesn't empower the ordinary person anymore.
It doesn't care so much about the ordinary person anymore, and I think this diagnosis of the political disease is correct.
With regard to the answers, I am far less certain.
I think what we are seeing is the immediate human reaction: if something doesn't work, let's go back.
And you see it all over the world, that people, almost nobody in the political system today, has any future-oriented vision of where humankind is going.
Almost everywhere, you see retrograde vision: "Let's make America great again," like it was great — I don't know — in the '50s, in the' 80s, sometime, let's go back there.
And you go to Russia a hundred years after Lenin, Putin's vision for the future is basically, ah, let's go back to the Tsarist empire. And in Israel, where I come from, the hottest political vision of the present is: "Let's build the temple again." So let's go back 2,000 years backwards.
So people are thinking sometime in the past we've lost it, and sometimes in the past, it's like you've lost your way in the city, and you say OK, let's go back to the point where I felt secure and start again.
I don't think this can work, but a lot of people, this is their gut instinct.
CA: But why couldn't it work? "America First" is a very appealing slogan in many ways.
Patriotism is, in many ways, a very noble thing.
It's played a role in promoting cooperation among large numbers of people.
Why couldn't you have a world organized in countries, all of which put themselves first?
YNH: For many centuries, even thousands of years, patriotism worked quite well.
Of course, it led to wars an so forth, but we shouldn't focus too much on the bad.
There are also many, many positive things about patriotism, and the ability to have a large number of people care about each other, sympathize with one another, and come together for collective action.
If you go back to the first nations, so, thousands of years ago, the people who lived along the Yellow River in China -- it was many, many different tribes and they all depended on the river for survival and for prosperity, but all of them also suffered from periodical floods and periodical droughts.
And no tribe could really do anything about it, because each of them controlled just a tiny section of the river.
And then in a long and complicated process, the tribes coalesced together to form the Chinese nation, which controlled the entire Yellow River and had the ability to bring hundreds of thousands of people together to build dams and canals and regulate the river and prevent the worst floods and droughts and raise the level of prosperity for everybody.
And this worked in many places around the world. But in the 21st century, technology is changing all that in a fundamental way.
We are now living -- all people in the world -- are living alongside the same cyber river, and no single nation can regulate this river by itself.
We are all living together on a single planet, which is threatened by our own actions.
And if you don't have some kind of global cooperation, nationalism is just not on the right level to tackle the problems, whether it's climate change or whether it's technological disruption.
CA: So it was a beautiful idea in a world where most of the action, most of the issues, took place on national scale, but your argument is that the issues that matter most today no longer take place on a national scale but on a global scale.
YNH: Exactly. All the major problems of the world today are global in essence, and they cannot be solved unless through some kind of global cooperation.
It's not just climate change, which is, like, the most obvious example people give.
I think more in terms of technological disruption.
If you think about, for example, artificial intelligence, over the next 20, 30 years pushing hundreds of millions of people out of the job market -- this is a problem on a global level.
It will disrupt the economy of all the countries.
And similarly, if you think about, say, bioengineering and people being afraid of conducting, I don't know, genetic engineering research in humans, it won't help if just a single country, let's say the US, outlaws all genetic experiments in humans, but China or North Korea continues to do it.
So the US cannot solve it by itself, and very quickly, the pressure on the US to do the same will be immense because we are talking about high-risk, high-gain technologies.
If somebody else is doing it, I can't allow myself to remain behind.
The only way to have regulations, effective regulations, on things like genetic engineering, is to have global regulations.
If you just have national regulations, nobody would like to stay behind.
CA: So this is really interesting.
It seems to me that this may be one key to provoking at least a constructive conversation between the different sides here, because I think everyone can agree that the start point of a lot of the anger that's propelled us to where we are is because of the legitimate concerns about job loss.
Work is gone, a traditional way of life has gone, and it's no wonder that people are furious about that.
And in general, they have blamed globalism, global elites, for doing this to them without asking their permission, and that seems like a legitimate complaint.
But what I hear you saying is that -- so a key question is: What is the real cause of job loss, both now and going forward?
To the extent that it's about globalism, then the right response, yes, is to shut down borders and keep people out and change trade agreements and so forth. But you're saying, I think, that actually the bigger cause of job loss is not going to be that at all.
It's going to originate in technological questions, and we have no chance of solving that unless we operate as a connected world.
YNH: Yeah, I think that, I don't know about the present, but looking to the future, it's not the Mexicans or Chinese who will take the jobs from the people in Pennsylvania, it's the robots and algorithms.
So unless you plan to build a big wall on the border of California --
the wall on the border with Mexico is going to be very ineffective.
And I was struck when I watched the debates before the election, I was struck that certainly Trump did not even attempt to frighten people by saying the robots will take your jobs. Now even if it's not true, it doesn't matter.
It could have been an extremely effective way of frightening people --
and galvanizing people: "The robots will take your jobs!" And nobody used that line.
And it made me afraid, because it meant that no matter what happens in universities and laboratories, and there, there is already an intense debate about it, but in the mainstream political system and among the general public, people are just unaware that there could be an immense technological disruption — not in 200 years, but in 10, 20, 30 years — and we have to do something about it now, partly because most of what we teach children today in school or in college is going to be completely irrelevant to the job market of 2040, 2050.
So it's not something we'll need to think about in 2040.
We need to think today what to teach the young people.
CA: Yeah, no, absolutely.
You've often written about moments in history where humankind has ... entered a new era, unintentionally.
Decisions have been made, technologies have been developed, and suddenly the world has changed, possibly in a way that's worse for everyone.
So one of the examples you give in "Sapiens" is just the whole agricultural revolution, which, for an actual person tilling the fields, they just picked up a 12-hour backbreaking workday instead of six hours in the jungle and a much more interesting lifestyle.
(Laughter)
So are we at another possible phase change here, where we kind of sleepwalk into a future that none of us actually wants?
YNH: Yes, very much so.
During the agricultural revolution, what happened is that immense technological and economic revolution empowered the human collective, but when you look at actual individual lives, the life of a tiny elite became much better, and the lives of the majority of people became considerably worse.
And this can happen again in the 21st century.
No doubt the new technologies will empower the human collective.
But we may end up again with a tiny elite reaping all the benefits, taking all the fruits, and the masses of the population finding themselves worse than they were before, certainly much worse than this tiny elite.
CA: And those elites might not even be human elites.
They might be cyborgs or --
YNH: Yeah, they could be enhanced super humans. They could be cyborgs.
They could even be non-conscious algorithms. What we see now in the world is authority shifting away from humans to algorithms.
More and more decisions -- about personal lives, about economic matters, about political matters -- are actually being taken by algorithms.
If you ask the bank for a loan, chances are your fate is decided by an algorithm, not by a human being.
And the general impression is that maybe Homo sapiens just lost it.
The world is so complicated, there is so much data, things are changing so fast, that this thing that evolved on the African savanna tens of thousands of years ago -- to cope with a particular environment, a particular volume of information and data -- it just can't handle the realities of the 21st century, and the only thing that may be able to handle it is big-data algorithms.
So no wonder more and more authority is shifting from us to the algorithms.
CA: So we're in New York City for the first of a series of TED Dialogues with Yuval Harari, and there's a Facebook Live audience out there.
We're excited to have you with us.
We'll start coming to some of your questions and questions of people in the room in just a few minutes, so have those coming.
Yuval, if you're going to make the argument that we need to get past nationalism because of the coming technological ... danger, in a way, presented by so much of what's happening we've got to have a global conversation about this.
Trouble is, it's hard to get people really believing that, I don't know, AI really is an imminent threat, and so forth.
The things that people, some people at least, care about much more immediately, perhaps, is climate change, perhaps other issues like refugees, nuclear weapons, and so forth. Would you argue that where we are right now that somehow those issues need to be dialed up?
You've talked about climate change, but Trump has said he doesn't believe in that.
So in a way, your most powerful argument, you can't actually use to make this case.
YNH: Yeah, I think with climate change, at first sight, it's quite surprising that there is a very close correlation between nationalism and climate change.
I mean, almost always, the people who deny climate change are nationalists.
And at first sight, you think: Why?
What's the connection?
Why don't you have socialists denying climate change?
But then, when you think about it, it's obvious -- because nationalism has no solution to climate change.
If you want to be a nationalist in the 21st century, you have to deny the problem.
If you accept the reality of the problem, then you must accept that, yes, there is still room in the world for patriotism, there is still room in the world for having special loyalties and obligations towards your own people, towards your own country.
I don't think anybody is really thinking of abolishing that.
But in order to confront climate change, we need additional loyalties and commitments to a level beyond the nation.
And that should not be impossible, because people can have several layers of loyalty.
You can be loyal to your family and to your community and to your nation, so why can't you also be loyal to humankind as a whole?
Of course, there are occasions when it becomes difficult, what to put first, but, you know, life is difficult. Handle it.
(Laughter)
CA: OK, so I would love to get some questions from the audience here.
We've got a microphone here.
Speak into it, and Facebook, get them coming, too.
Howard Morgan: One of the things that has clearly made a huge difference in this country and other countries is the income distribution inequality, the dramatic change in income distribution in the US from what it was 50 years ago, and around the world.
Is there anything we can do to affect that?
Because that gets at a lot of the underlying causes.
YNH: So far I haven't heard a very good idea about what to do about it, again, partly because most ideas remain on the national level, and the problem is global.
I mean, one idea that we hear quite a lot about now is universal basic income.
But this is a problem.
I mean, I think it's a good start, but it's a problematic idea because it's not clear what "universal" is and it's not clear what "basic" is.
Most people when they speak about universal basic income, they actually mean national basic income.
But the problem is global.
Let's say that you have AI and 3D printers taking away millions of jobs in Bangladesh, from all the people who make my shirts and my shoes. So what's going to happen? The US government will levy taxes on Google and Apple in California, and use that to pay basic income to unemployed Bangladeshis?
If you believe that, you can just as well believe that Santa Claus will come and solve the problem.
So unless we have really universal and not national basic income, the deep problems are not going to go away.
And also it's not clear what basic is, because what are basic human needs?
A thousand years ago, just food and shelter was enough.
But today, people will say education is a basic human need, it should be part of the package. But how much? Six years? Twelve years? PhD? Similarly, with health care, let's say that in 20, 30, 40 years, you'll have expensive treatments that can extend human life to 120, I don't know.
Will this be part of the basket of basic income or not?
It's a very difficult problem, because in a world where people lose their ability to be employed, the only thing they are going to get is this basic income.
So what's part of it is a very, very difficult ethical question.
CA: There's a bunch of questions on how the world affords it as well, who pays.
There's a question here from Facebook from Lisa Larson: "How does nationalism in the US now compare to that between World War I and World War II in the last century?"
YNH: Well the good news, with regard to the dangers of nationalism, we are in a much better position than a century ago.
A century ago, 1917, Europeans were killing each other by the millions.
In 2016, with Brexit, as far as I remember, a single person lost their life, an MP who was murdered by some extremist. Just a single person. I mean, if Brexit was about British independence, this is the most peaceful war of independence in human history.
And let's say that Scotland will now choose to leave the UK after Brexit.
So in the 18th century, if Scotland wanted — and the Scots wanted several times — to break out of the control of London, the reaction of the government in London was to send an army up north to burn down Edinburgh and massacre the highland tribes.
My guess is that if, in 2018, the Scots vote for independence, the London government will not send an army up north to burn down Edinburgh.
Very few people are now willing to kill or be killed for Scottish or for British independence.
So for all the talk of the rise of nationalism and going back to the 1930s, to the 19th century, in the West at least, the power of national sentiments today is far, far smaller than it was a century ago.
CA: Although some people now, you hear publicly worrying about whether that might be shifting, that there could actually be outbreaks of violence in the US depending on how things turn out.
Should we be worried about that, or do you really think things have shifted?
YNH: No, we should be worried. We should be aware of two things.
First of all, don't be hysterical.
We are not back in the First World War yet.
But on the other hand, don't be complacent.
We reached from 1917 to 2017, not by some divine miracle, but simply by human decisions, and if we now start making the wrong decisions, we could be back in an analogous situation to 1917 in a few years.
One of the things I know as a historian is that you should never underestimate human stupidity.
(Laughter)
It's one of the most powerful forces in history, human stupidity and human violence.
Humans do such crazy things for no obvious reason, but again, at the same time, another very powerful force in human history is human wisdom. We have both.
CA: We have with us here moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who I think has a question.
Jonathan Haidt: Thanks, Yuval.
So you seem to be a fan of global governance, but when you look at the map of the world from Transparency International, which rates the level of corruption of political institutions, it's a vast sea of red with little bits of yellow here and there for those with good institutions.
So if we were to have some kind of global governance, what makes you think it would end up being more like Denmark rather than more like Russia or Honduras, and aren't there alternatives, such as we did with CFCs?
There are ways to solve global problems with national governments.
What would world government actually look like, and why do you think it would work?
YNH: Well, I don't know what it would look like.
Nobody still has a model for that.
The main reason we need it is because many of these issues are lose-lose situations.
When you have a win-win situation like trade, both sides can benefit from a trade agreement, then this is something you can work out.
Without some kind of global government, national governments each have an interest in doing it.
But when you have a lose-lose situation like with climate change, it's much more difficult without some overarching authority, real authority.
Now, how to get there and what would it look like, I don't know.
And certainly there is no obvious reason to think that it would look like Denmark, or that it would be a democracy.
Most likely it wouldn't.
We don't have workable democratic models for a global government.
So maybe it would look more like ancient China than like modern Denmark.
But still, given the dangers that we are facing, I think the imperative of having some kind of real ability to force through difficult decisions on the global level is more important than almost anything else.
CA: There's a question from Facebook here, and then we'll get the mic to Andrew.
So, Kat Hebron on Facebook, calling in from Vail: "How would developed nations manage the millions of climate migrants?"
YNH: I don't know.
CA: That's your answer, Kat. (Laughter)
YNH: And I don't think that they know either.
They'll just deny the problem, maybe.
CA: But immigration, generally, is another example of a problem that's very hard to solve on a nation-by-nation basis.
One nation can shut its doors, but maybe that stores up problems for the future.
YNH: Yes, I mean — it's another very good case, especially because it's so much easier to migrate today than it was in the Middle Ages or in ancient times.
CA: Yuval, there's a belief among many technologists, certainly, that political concerns are kind of overblown, that actually, political leaders don't have that much influence in the world, that the real determination of humanity at this point is by science, by invention, by companies, by many things other than political leaders, and it's actually very hard for leaders to do much, so we're actually worrying about nothing here.
YNH: Well, first, it should be emphasized that it's true that political leaders' ability to do good is very limited, but their ability to do harm is unlimited.
There is a basic imbalance here.
You can still press the button and blow everybody up.
You have that kind of ability.
But if you want, for example, to reduce inequality, that's very, very difficult.
But to start a war, you can still do so very easily.
So there is a built-in imbalance in the political system today which is very frustrating, where you cannot do a lot of good but you can still do a lot of harm.
And this makes the political system still a very big concern.
CA: So as you look at what's happening today, and putting your historian's hat on, do you look back in history at moments when things were going just fine and an individual leader really took the world or their country backwards?
YNH: There are quite a few examples, but I should emphasize, it's never an individual leader.
I mean, somebody put him there, and somebody allowed him to continue to be there.
So it's never really just the fault of a single individual.
There are a lot of people behind every such individual.
CA: Can we have the microphone here, please, to Andrew?
Andrew Solomon: You've talked a lot about the global versus the national, but increasingly, it seems to me, the world situation is in the hands of identity groups.
We look at people within the United States who have been recruited by ISIS.
We look at these other groups which have formed which go outside of national bounds but still represent significant authorities.
How are they to be integrated into the system, and how is a diverse set of identities to be made coherent under either national or global leadership?
YNH: Well, the problem of such diverse identities is a problem from nationalism as well.
Nationalism believes in a single, monolithic identity, and exclusive or at least more extreme versions of nationalism believe in an exclusive loyalty to a single identity.
And therefore, nationalism has had a lot of problems with people wanting to divide their identities between various groups.
So it's not just a problem, say, for a global vision.
And I think, again, history shows that you shouldn't necessarily think in such exclusive terms.
If you think that there is just a single identity for a person, "I am just X, that's it, I can't be several things, I can be just that," that's the start of the problem.
You have religions, you have nations that sometimes demand exclusive loyalty, but it's not the only option.
There are many religions and many nations that enable you to have diverse identities at the same time.
CA: But is one explanation of what's happened in the last year that a group of people have got fed up with, if you like, the liberal elites, for want of a better term, obsessing over many, many different identities and them feeling, "But what about my identity?
I am being completely ignored here.
And by the way, I thought I was the majority"?
And that that's actually sparked a lot of the anger.
YNH: Yeah. Identity is always problematic, because identity is always based on fictional stories that sooner or later collide with reality.
Almost all identities, I mean, beyond the level of the basic community of a few dozen people, are based on a fictional story.
They are not the truth.
They are not the reality.
It's just a story that people invent and tell one another and start believing.
And therefore all identities are extremely unstable.
They are not a biological reality.
Sometimes nationalists, for example, think that the nation is a biological entity.
It's made of the combination of soil and blood, creates the nation.
But this is just a fictional story.
CA: Soil and blood kind of makes a gooey mess.
(Laughter)
YNH: It does, and also it messes with your mind when you think too much that I am a combination of soil and blood.
If you look from a biological perspective, obviously none of the nations that exist today existed 5,000 years ago.
Homo sapiens is a social animal, that's for sure.
But for millions of years, Homo sapiens and our hominid ancestors lived in small communities of a few dozen individuals.
Everybody knew everybody else.
Whereas modern nations are imagined communities, in the sense that I don't even know all these people.
I come from a relatively small nation, Israel, and of eight million Israelis, I never met most of them.
I will never meet most of them.
They basically exist here.
CA: But in terms of this identity, this group who feel left out and perhaps have work taken away, I mean, in "Homo Deus," you actually speak of this group in one sense expanding, that so many people may have their jobs taken away by technology in some way that we could end up with a really large -- I think you call it a "useless class" -- a class where traditionally, as viewed by the economy, these people have no use.
YNH: Yes.
CA: How likely a possibility is that?
Is that something we should be terrified about?
And can we address it in any way?
YNH: We should think about it very carefully.
I mean, nobody really knows what the job market will look like in 2040, 2050.
There is a chance many new jobs will appear, but it's not certain.
And even if new jobs do appear, it won't necessarily be easy for a 50-year old unemployed truck driver made unemployed by self-driving vehicles, it won't be easy for an unemployed truck driver to reinvent himself or herself as a designer of virtual worlds.
Previously, if you look at the trajectory of the industrial revolution, when machines replaced humans in one type of work, the solution usually came from low-skill work in new lines of business.
So you didn't need any more agricultural workers, so people moved to working in low-skill industrial jobs, and when this was taken away by more and more machines, people moved to low-skill service jobs.
Now, when people say there will be new jobs in the future, that humans can do better than AI, that humans can do better than robots, they usually think about high-skill jobs, like software engineers designing virtual worlds.
Now, I don't see how an unemployed cashier from Wal-Mart reinvents herself or himself at 50 as a designer of virtual worlds, and certainly I don't see how the millions of unemployed Bangladeshi textile workers will be able to do that.
I mean, if they are going to do it, we need to start teaching the Bangladeshis today how to be software designers, and we are not doing it.
So what will they do in 20 years?
CA: So it feels like you're really highlighting a question that's really been bugging me the last few months more and more.
It's almost a hard question to ask in public, but if any mind has some wisdom to offer in it, maybe it's yours, so I'm going to ask you: What are humans for?
YNH: As far as we know, for nothing.
(Laughter)
I mean, there is no great cosmic drama, some great cosmic plan, that we have a role to play in.
And we just need to discover what our role is and then play it to the best of our ability.
This has been the story of all religions and ideologies and so forth, but as a scientist, the best I can say is this is not true.
There is no universal drama with a role in it for Homo sapiens. So —
CA: I'm going to push back on you just for a minute, just from your own book, because in "Homo Deus," you give really one of the most coherent and understandable accounts about sentience, about consciousness, and that unique sort of human skill.
You point out that it's different from intelligence, the intelligence that we're building in machines, and that there's actually a lot of mystery around it.
How can you be sure there's no purpose when we don't even understand what this sentience thing is?
I mean, in your own thinking, isn't there a chance that what humans are for is to be the universe's sentient things, to be the centers of joy and love and happiness and hope?
And maybe we can build machines that actually help amplify that, even if they're not going to become sentient themselves? Is that crazy? I kind of found myself hoping that, reading your book.
YNH: Well, I certainly think that the most interesting question today in science is the question of consciousness and the mind.
We are getting better and better in understanding the brain and intelligence, but we are not getting much better in understanding the mind and consciousness.
People often confuse intelligence and consciousness, especially in places like Silicon Valley, which is understandable, because in humans, they go together.
I mean, intelligence basically is the ability to solve problems.
Consciousness is the ability to feel things, to feel joy and sadness and boredom and pain and so forth.
In Homo sapiens and all other mammals as well -- it's not unique to humans -- in all mammals and birds and some other animals, intelligence and consciousness go together.
We often solve problems by feeling things.
So we tend to confuse them.
But they are different things.
What's happening today in places like Silicon Valley is that we are creating artificial intelligence but not artificial consciousness.
There has been an amazing development in computer intelligence over the last 50 years, and exactly zero development in computer consciousness, and there is no indication that computers are going to become conscious anytime soon.
So first of all, if there is some cosmic role for consciousness, it's not unique to Homo sapiens.
Cows are conscious, pigs are conscious, chimpanzees are conscious, chickens are conscious, so if we go that way, first of all, we need to broaden our horizons and remember very clearly we are not the only sentient beings on Earth, and when it comes to sentience -- when it comes to intelligence, there is good reason to think we are the most intelligent of the whole bunch.
But when it comes to sentience, to say that humans are more sentient than whales, or more sentient than baboons or more sentient than cats, I see no evidence for that.
So first step is, you go in that direction, expand.
And then the second question of what is it for, I would reverse it and I would say that I don't think sentience is for anything.
I think we don't need to find our role in the universe.
The really important thing is to liberate ourselves from suffering.
What characterizes sentient beings in contrast to robots, to stones, to whatever, is that sentient beings suffer, can suffer, and what they should focus on is not finding their place in some mysterious cosmic drama.
They should focus on understanding what suffering is, what causes it and how to be liberated from it.
CA: I know this is a big issue for you, and that was very eloquent.
We're going to have a blizzard of questions from the audience here, and maybe from Facebook as well, and maybe some comments as well. So let's go quick. There's one right here.
Keep your hands held up at the back if you want the mic, and we'll get it back to you.
Question: In your work, you talk a lot about the fictional stories that we accept as truth, and we live our lives by it.
As an individual, knowing that, how does it impact the stories that you choose to live your life, and do you confuse them with the truth, like all of us?
YNH: I try not to.
I mean, for me, maybe the most important question, both as a scientist and as a person, is how to tell the difference between fiction and reality, because reality is there.
I'm not saying that everything is fiction.
It's just very difficult for human beings to tell the difference between fiction and reality, and it has become more and more difficult as history progressed, because the fictions that we have created — nations and gods and money and corporations — they now control the world.
So just to even think, "Oh, this is just all fictional entities that we've created," is very difficult.
But reality is there.
For me the best... There are several tests to tell the difference between fiction and reality.
The simplest one, the best one that I can say in short, is the test of suffering.
If it can suffer, it's real.
If it can't suffer, it's not real.
A nation cannot suffer.
That's very, very clear.
Even if a nation loses a war, we say, "Germany suffered a defeat in the First World War," it's a metaphor. Germany cannot suffer. Germany has no mind.
Germany has no consciousness.
Germans can suffer, yes, but Germany cannot.
Similarly, when a bank goes bust, the bank cannot suffer.
When the dollar loses its value, the dollar doesn't suffer. People can suffer. Animals can suffer. This is real. So I would start, if you really want to see reality, I would go through the door of suffering.
If you can really understand what suffering is, this will give you also the key to understand what reality is.
CA: There's a Facebook question here that connects to this, from someone around the world in a language that I cannot read.
YNH: Oh, it's Hebrew. CA: Hebrew. There you go.
(Laughter)
Can you read the name?
YNH: Or Lauterbach Goren.
CA: Well, thank you for writing in.
The question is: "Is the post-truth era really a brand-new era, or just another climax or moment in a never-ending trend?
YNH: Personally, I don't connect with this idea of post-truth.
My basic reaction as a historian is: If this is the era of post-truth, when the hell was the era of truth?
CA: Right.
YNH: Was it the 1980s, the 1950s, the Middle Ages?
I mean, we have always lived in an era, in a way, of post-truth.
CA: But I'd push back on that, because I think what people are talking about is that there was a world where you had fewer journalistic outlets, where there were traditions, that things were fact-checked.
It was incorporated into the charter of those organizations that the truth mattered.
So if you believe in a reality, then what you write is information.
There was a belief that that information should connect to reality in a real way, and if you wrote a headline, it was a serious, earnest attempt to reflect something that had actually happened.
And people didn't always get it right.
But I think the concern now is you've got a technological system that's incredibly powerful that, for a while at least, massively amplified anything with no attention paid to whether it connected to reality, only to whether it connected to clicks and attention, and that that was arguably toxic.
That's a reasonable concern, isn't it?
YNH: Yeah, it is.
I mean, the technology changes, and it's now easier to disseminate both truth and fiction and falsehood.
It goes both ways.
It's also much easier, though, to spread the truth than it was ever before.
But I don't think there is anything essentially new about this disseminating fictions and errors.
There is nothing that — I don't know — Joseph Goebbels, didn't know about all this idea of fake news and post-truth.
He famously said that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will think it's the truth, and the bigger the lie, the better, because people won't even think that something so big can be a lie.
I think that fake news has been with us for thousands of years.
Just think of the Bible.
(Laughter)
CA: But there is a concern that the fake news is associated with tyrannical regimes, and when you see an uprise in fake news that is a canary in the coal mine that there may be dark times coming.
YNH: Yeah. I mean, the intentional use of fake news is a disturbing sign.
But I'm not saying that it's not bad, I'm just saying that it's not new.
CA: There's a lot of interest on Facebook on this question about global governance versus nationalism.
Question here from Phil Dennis: "How do we get people, governments, to relinquish power?
Is that -- is that -- actually, the text is so big I can't read the full question.
But is that a necessity?
Is it going to take war to get there?
Sorry Phil -- I mangled your question, but I blame the text right here.
YNH: One option that some people talk about is that only a catastrophe can shake humankind and open the path to a real system of global governance, and they say that we can't do it before the catastrophe, but we need to start laying the foundations so that when the disaster strikes, we can react quickly.
But people will just not have the motivation to do such a thing before the disaster strikes.
Another thing that I would emphasize is that anybody who is really interested in global governance should always make it very, very clear that it doesn't replace or abolish local identities and communities, that it should come both as -- It should be part of a single package.
CA: I want to hear more on this, because the very words "global governance" are almost the epitome of evil in the mindset of a lot of people on the alt-right right now.
It just seems scary, remote, distant, and it has let them down, and so globalists, global governance -- no, go away!
And many view the election as the ultimate poke in the eye to anyone who believes in that.
So how do we change the narrative so that it doesn't seem so scary and remote?
Build more on this idea of it being compatible with local identity, local communities.
YNH: Well, I think again we should start really with the biological realities of Homo sapiens.
And biology tells us two things about Homo sapiens which are very relevant to this issue: first of all, that we are completely dependent on the ecological system around us, and that today we are talking about a global system.
You cannot escape that.
And at the same time, biology tells us about Homo sapiens that we are social animals, but that we are social on a very, very local level.
It's just a simple fact of humanity that we cannot have intimate familiarity with more than about 150 individuals.
The size of the natural group, the natural community of Homo sapiens, is not more than 150 individuals, and everything beyond that is really based on all kinds of imaginary stories and large-scale institutions, and I think that we can find a way, again, based on a biological understanding of our species, to weave the two together and to understand that today in the 21st century, we need both the global level and the local community.
And I would go even further than that and say that it starts with the body itself.
The feelings that people today have of alienation and loneliness and not finding their place in the world, I would think that the chief problem is not global capitalism.
The chief problem is that over the last hundred years, people have been becoming disembodied, have been distancing themselves from their body.
As a hunter-gatherer or even as a peasant, to survive, you need to be constantly in touch with your body and with your senses, every moment.
If you go to the forest to look for mushrooms and you don't pay attention to what you hear, to what you smell, to what you taste, you're dead.
So you must be very connected.
In the last hundred years, people are losing their ability to be in touch with their body and their senses, to hear, to smell, to feel.
More and more attention goes to screens, to what is happening elsewhere, some other time.
This, I think, is the deep reason for the feelings of alienation and loneliness and so forth, and therefore part of the solution is not to bring back some mass nationalism, but also reconnect with our own bodies, and if you are back in touch with your body, you will feel much more at home in the world also.
CA: Well, depending on how things go, we may all be back in the forest soon.
We're going to have one more question in the room and one more on Facebook.
Ama Adi-Dako: Hello. I'm from Ghana, West Africa, and my question is: I'm wondering how do you present and justify the idea of global governance to countries that have been historically disenfranchised by the effects of globalization, and also, if we're talking about global governance, it sounds to me like it will definitely come from a very Westernized idea of what the "global" is supposed to look like.
So how do we present and justify that idea of global versus wholly nationalist to people in countries like Ghana and Nigeria and Togo and other countries like that?
YNH: I would start by saying that history is extremely unfair, and that we should realize that.
Many of the countries that suffered most from the last 200 years of globalization and imperialism and industrialization are exactly the countries which are also most likely to suffer most from the next wave.
And we should be very, very clear about that.
If we don't have a global governance, and if we suffer from climate change, from technological disruptions, the worst suffering will not be in the US.
The worst suffering will be in Ghana, will be in Sudan, will be in Syria, will be in Bangladesh, will be in those places.
So I think those countries have an even greater incentive to do something about the next wave of disruption, whether it's ecological or whether it's technological.
Again, if you think about technological disruption, so if AI and 3D printers and robots will take the jobs from billions of people, I worry far less about the Swedes than about the people in Ghana or in Bangladesh.
And therefore, because history is so unfair and the results of a calamity will not be shared equally between everybody, as usual, the rich will be able to get away from the worst consequences of climate change in a way that the poor will not be able to.
CA: And here's a great question from Cameron Taylor on Facebook: "At the end of 'Sapiens,'" you said we should be asking the question, 'What do we want to want?' Well, what do you think we should want to want?"
YNH: I think we should want to want to know the truth, to understand reality.
Mostly what we want is to change reality, to fit it to our own desires, to our own wishes, and I think we should first want to understand it.
If you look at the long-term trajectory of history, what you see is that for thousands of years we humans have been gaining control of the world outside us and trying to shape it to fit our own desires.
And we've gained control of the other animals, of the rivers, of the forests, and reshaped them completely, causing an ecological destruction without making ourselves satisfied.
So the next step is we turn our gaze inwards, and we say OK, getting control of the world outside us did not really make us satisfied.
Let's now try to gain control of the world inside us.
This is the really big project of science and technology and industry in the 21st century -- to try and gain control of the world inside us, to learn how to engineer and produce bodies and brains and minds.
These are likely to be the main products of the 21st century economy.
When people think about the future, very often they think in terms, "Oh, I want to gain control of my body and of my brain." And I think that's very dangerous.
If we've learned anything from our previous history, it's that yes, we gain the power to manipulate, but because we didn't really understand the complexity of the ecological system, we are now facing an ecological meltdown.
And if we now try to reengineer the world inside us without really understanding it, especially without understanding the complexity of our mental system, we might cause a kind of internal ecological disaster, and we'll face a kind of mental meltdown inside us.
CA: Putting all the pieces together here -- the current politics, the coming technology, concerns like the one you've just outlined -- I mean, it seems like you yourself are in quite a bleak place when you think about the future.
You're pretty worried about it. Is that right? And if there was one cause for hope, how would you state that?
YNH: I focus on the most dangerous possibilities partly because this is like my job or responsibility as a historian or social critic.
I mean, the industry focuses mainly on the positive sides, so it's the job of historians and philosophers and sociologists to highlight the more dangerous potential of all these new technologies.
I don't think any of that is inevitable.
Technology is never deterministic.
You can use the same technology to create very different kinds of societies.
If you look at the 20th century, so, the technologies of the Industrial Revolution, the trains and electricity and all that could be used to create a communist dictatorship or a fascist regime or a liberal democracy.
The trains did not tell you what to do with them.
Similarly, now, artificial intelligence and bioengineering and all of that -- they don't predetermine a single outcome.
Humanity can rise up to the challenge, and the best example we have of humanity rising up to the challenge of a new technology is nuclear weapons.
In the late 1940s, '50s, many people were convinced that sooner or later the Cold War will end in a nuclear catastrophe, destroying human civilization.
And this did not happen.
In fact, nuclear weapons prompted humans all over the world to change the way that they manage international politics to reduce violence.
And many countries basically took out war from their political toolkit.
They no longer tried to pursue their interests with warfare.
Not all countries have done so, but many countries have.
And this is maybe the most important reason why international violence declined dramatically since 1945, and today, as I said, more people commit suicide than are killed in war.
So this, I think, gives us a good example that even the most frightening technology, humans can rise up to the challenge and actually some good can come out of it.
The problem is, we have very little margin for error.
If we don't get it right, we might not have a second option to try again.
CA: That's a very powerful note, on which I think we should draw this to a conclusion.
Before I wrap up, I just want to say one thing to people here and to the global TED community watching online, anyone watching online: help us with these dialogues.
If you believe, like we do, that we need to find a different kind of conversation, now more than ever, help us do it.
Reach out to other people, try and have conversations with people you disagree with, understand them, pull the pieces together, and help us figure out how to take these conversations forward so we can make a real contribution to what's happening in the world right now.
I think everyone feels more alive, more concerned, more engaged with the politics of the moment.
The stakes do seem quite high, so help us respond to it in a wise, wise way.
Yuval Harari, thank you.
This story starts with these two -- my kids.
We were hiking in the Oakland woods when my daughter noticed a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.
She looked at me and said, "Daddy?
That doesn't go there."
When she said that, it reminded me of summer camp.
On the morning of visiting day, right before they'd let our anxious parents come barreling through the gates, our camp director would say, "Quick!
Everyone pick up five pieces of litter. "You get a couple hundred kids each picking up five pieces, and pretty soon, you've got a much cleaner camp.
So I thought, why not apply that crowdsourced cleanup model to the entire planet?
And that was the inspiration for Litterati.
The vision is to create a litter-free world.
Let me show you how it started. I took a picture of a cigarette using Instagram. Then I took another photo ... and another photo ... and another photo.
And I noticed two things: one, litter became artistic and approachable; and two, at the end of a few days, I had 50 photos on my phone and I had picked up each piece, and I realized that I was keeping a record of the positive impact I was having on the planet.
That's 50 less things that you might see, or you might step on, or some bird might eat.
So I started telling people what I was doing, and they started participating.
One day, this photo showed up from China.
And that's when I realized that Litterati was more than just pretty pictures; we were becoming a community that was collecting data.
Each photo tells a story.
It tells us who picked up what, a geotag tells us where and a time stamp tells us when.
So I built a Google map, and started plotting the points where pieces were being picked up.
And through that process, the community grew and the data grew.
My two kids go to school right in that bullseye.
Litter: it's blending into the background of our lives.
But what if we brought it to the forefront?
What if we understood exactly what was on our streets, our sidewalks and our school yards?
How might we use that data to make a difference?
Well, let me show you. The first is with cities.
San Francisco wanted to understand what percentage of litter was cigarettes. Why? To create a tax.
So they put a couple of people in the streets with pencils and clipboards, who walked around collecting information which led to a 20-cent tax on all cigarette sales.
And then they got sued by big tobacco, who claimed that collecting information with pencils and clipboards is neither precise nor provable.
The city called me and asked if our technology could help.
I'm not sure they realized that our technology was my Instagram account --
(Laughter)
But I said, "Yes, we can."
(Laughter)
"And we can tell you if that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.
Plus, every photograph is geotagged and time-stamped, providing you with proof." Four days and 5,000 pieces later, our data was used in court to not only defend but double the tax, generating an annual recurring revenue of four million dollars for San Francisco to clean itself up.
Now, during that process I learned two things: one, Instagram is not the right tool --
(Laughter)
so we built an app.
And two, if you think about it, every city in the world has a unique litter fingerprint, and that fingerprint provides both the source of the problem and the path to the solution.
If you could generate a revenue stream just by understanding the percentage of cigarettes, well, what about coffee cups or soda cans or plastic bottles?
If you could fingerprint San Francisco, well, how about Oakland or Amsterdam or somewhere much closer to home?
And what about brands?
How might they use this data to align their environmental and economic interests?
There's a block in downtown Oakland that's covered in blight.
The Litterati community got together and picked up 1,500 pieces.
And here's what we learned: most of that litter came from a very well-known taco brand.
Most of that brand's litter were their own hot sauce packets, and most of those hot sauce packets hadn't even been opened.
The problem and the path to the solution — well, maybe that brand only gives out hot sauce upon request or installs bulk dispensers or comes up with more sustainable packaging.
How does a brand take an environmental hazard, turn it into an economic engine and become an industry hero?
If you really want to create change, there's no better place to start than with our kids.
A group of fifth graders picked up 1,247 pieces of litter just on their school yard.
And they learned that the most common type of litter were the plastic straw wrappers from their own cafeteria.
So these kids went to their principal and asked, "Why are we still buying straws?" And they stopped.
And they learned that individually they could each make a difference, but together they created an impact.
It doesn't matter if you're a student or a scientist, whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi, this is a community for everyone.
It started because of two little kids in the Northern California woods, and today it's spread across the world.
And you know how we're getting there?
One piece at a time.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Joseph Keller used to jog around the Stanford campus, and he was struck by all the women jogging there as well.
Why did their ponytails swing from side to side like that?
Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why.
(Laughter)
Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms wriggle.
Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller.
I read about him in the New York Times, in the obituaries.
The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature.
I read the obituaries almost every day.
My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a "Let's see who died today."
(Laughter)
But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues man's failures.
An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries.
In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that marketers can derive from past data -- a kind of rearview-mirror analysis.
And we began to think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times?
Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured -- even if you aren't around to enjoy it?
(Laughter)
Would this go better with scrambled eggs?
(Laughter)
And so, we looked at the data.
2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016.
What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us?
Well, first we looked at words.
This here is an obituary headline.
This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew.
If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime.
Just looking at these is fascinating.
Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years.
Try and guess who they are.
[An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince.
[Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha Hadid.
So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing, where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words -- "the," "and," -- the kind of words you can mime easily in "Charades," -- and leaves you with the most significant words.
And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors.
And this is what it looks like.
Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law to be construed as successful.
And while we're talking profession, let's look at age -- the average age at which they achieved things.
That number is 37.
What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for -- on average -- 44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 -- on average.
(Laughter)
Talk about having to be patient.
(Laughter)
Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s.
And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of politics.
(Laughter)
Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s.
(Laughter)
If you're wondering what "others" are, here are some examples.
Isn't it fascinating, the things people do and the things they're remembered for?
(Laughter)
Our curiosity was in overdrive, and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor.
So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous.
Famous people — Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid — people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly.
I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names.
Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous.
So what if we analyze these two groups separately -- the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell us?
Take a look. Two things leap out at me.
First: "John."
(Laughter)
Anyone here named John should thank your parents --
(Laughter)
and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone.
And second: "help."
We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print could teach us.
The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life, and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things.
They made a positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped.
So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society?
Because the most powerful lesson here is, if more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death, the world would be a much better place.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to introduce you to some very wise kids that I've known, but first I want to introduce you to a camel.
This is Cassie, a therapy camel visiting one of our young patients in her room, which is pretty magical.
A friend of mine raises camels at his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
He has about eight of them, and he started 30 years ago because he thought horses were too mundane.
John is an out-of-the-box thinker, which explains why the two of us have been such good friends all of our lives.
Over the years, I've convinced him to shuttle those sweet furry beasts up to hang out with our sick kids from time to time.
Talking to John, I was surprised to learn that camels have an average life expectancy of 40 to 50 years.
The life expectancy of many of the children with whom I work is less than a year.
This is a picture of the George Mark Children's House, the first pediatric palliative respite care center to open in the United States.
I founded it in 2004, after years of working as a psychologist on pediatric intensive care units, frustrated with the undignified deaths that so many children experienced and their families had to endure.
As I sat with families whose children were at the end of their lives, I was acutely aware of our surroundings.
While the elevated train rumbled overhead on its track, quite literally the room reverberated with each passing train car.
The lights on the ward were fluorescent and too bright.
Monitors beeped, as did the elevator, noisily announcing its arrival.
These families were experiencing some of the most excruciating moments of their lives, and I so wanted them to have a more peaceful place in which to say a last goodbye to their young daughters and sons.
Surely, I thought, there must be a better spot than a hospital intensive care unit for children at the end of their lives.
Our children's house is calm and nurturing.
It's a place where families can stay together to enjoy quality time with their children, many of whom are there for respite stays, some with repeated visits over a span of many years.
We call those kids our frequent flyers.
Rather than the bright, noisy quarters of the hospital, their rooms are calm and comfortable, with actual living spaces for the families, a sanctuary of gardens and a wonderful outdoor playground with special structures for children with physical limitations.
This sweet baby Lars came to us directly from a hospital intensive care unit.
Imagine hearing the heartbreaking news that none of us would ever want to hear.
His parents had been told that Lars had a brain anomaly that would keep him from ever swallowing, walking, talking or developing mentally.
Recognizing what little chance he had for survival, his parents chose to focus on the quality of time that they could spend together.
They moved into one of our family apartments and treasured each day that they had, which were far too few.
Lars's life was brief, to be sure, mere weeks, but it was calm and comfortable.
He went on hikes with his parents.
The time that he spent in the pool with our aquatic therapist lessened the seizures he was experiencing and helped him to sleep at night.
His family had a peaceful place in which to both celebrate his life and mourn his death.
It has been five years since Lars was with us, and in that time, his family has welcomed a daughter and another son.
They are such a powerful testament to the positive outcome that specialized children's hospice care can create.
Their baby's physical discomfort was well managed, giving all of them the gift of time to be together in a beautiful place.
I'm going to talk to you now about the elephant rather than the camel in the room.
Very few people want to talk about death, and even fewer about children's death.
Loss of a child, especially for those of us who have our own children, is frightening, more than frightening, paralyzing, debilitating, impossible.
But what I've learned is this: children don't stop dying just because we the adults can't comprehend the injustice of losing them.
And what's more, if we can be brave enough to face the possibility of death, even among the most innocent, we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom.
Take Crystal, for example.
She was one of the first children to come for care after we opened our doors.
She was nine when she arrived, and her neurologist expected that she might live another two weeks.
She had an inoperable brain tumor, and her decline had really accelerated in the week before she came to us.
After settling into her room, dressed entirely in pink and lavender, surrounded by the Hello Kitty accessories that she loved, she spent the next several days winning over the hearts of every staff member.
Bit by bit, her condition stabilized, and then to our astonishment, she actually improved.
There were a variety of factors that contributed to Crystal's improvement which we later came to call the "George Mark bump," a lovely, not uncommon phenomenon where children outlive the prognoses of their illnesses if they're outside of the hospital.
The calmer atmosphere of her surroundings, tasty meals that were fixed often to accommodate her requests, the resident pets, the therapy dog and rabbit spent lots of cozy time with Crystal.
After she had been with us for about a week, she called her grandmother, and she said, "Gee, I'm staying in a great big house, and there's room for you to come, too. And guess what? You don't have to bring any quarters because the washer and dryer are free."
(Laughter)
Crystal's grandmother soon arrived from out of town, and they spent the remaining four months of Crystal's life enjoying very special days together.
Some days were special because Crystal was outside in her wheelchair sitting by the fountain.
For a little girl who had spent most of the year earlier in a hospital bed, being outside counting hummingbirds made for an amazing time with her grandma, and lots of laughter.
Other days were special because of the activities that our child life specialist created for her.
Crystal strung beads and made jewelry for everybody in the house.
She painted a pumpkin to help decorate for Halloween.
She spent many excited days planning her tenth birthday, which of course none of us thought she would ever see.
All of us wore pink boas for the occasion, and Crystal, as you can see, queen for a day, wore a sparkly tiara.
One hot morning, I arrived at work and Crystal and her partner in crime, Charlie, greeted me.
With some help, they had set up a lemonade and cookie stand outside the front door, a very strategic location.
I asked Crystal the price of the cookie that I had selected, and she said, "Three dollars."
(Laughter)
I said that seemed a bit high for one cookie.
(Laughter)
It was small. "I know," she acknowledged with a grin, "but I'm worth it."
And therein lie the words of wisdom of a young girl whose brief life forever impacted mine.
Crystal was worth it, and shouldn't every child whose life is shortened by a horrific illness be worth it?
Together, all of us today can offer that same specialized care that Crystal received by recognizing that children's respite and hospice care is a critical component missing from our healthcare landscape.
It's also interesting to note that we are able to provide this care at about one third of the cost of a hospital intensive care unit, and our families don't see a bill.
We are ever grateful to the supporters who believe in this important work that we're doing.
The truth is that my colleagues and I and the parents and other family members who get to experience this special wisdom are in a unique position.
There are only two freestanding pediatric hospices in the United States, although I'm happy to report that based on our model, there are 18 others under various stages of development.
(Applause)
Still, most of the children who die in the United States every year die in hospital rooms, surrounded by beeping machines and anxious, exhausted adults who have no other option but to say goodbye under those harsh, institutional lights and among virtual strangers.
For comparison's sake, the United Kingdom, which is a country with about one fifth the population of the United States, and about half the size of the state of California, has 54 hospice and respite centers. Why is that? I've asked myself that question obviously many times.
My best guess is that Americans, with our positive can-do attitude hold the expectation that our medical care system will fix it, even though it may be a childhood illness for which there is no cure.
We go to extraordinary measures to keep children alive when in fact the greatest kindness that we might give them would be a peaceful, pain-free end of life.
The transition from cure to care remains a challenging one for many hospital physicians whose training has really been about saving lives, not about gently guiding the patient to the end of life.
The dad of a sweet baby for whom we cared at the end of her life certainly captured this dichotomy when he reflected that there are a lot of people to help you bring an infant into the world but very few to help you usher a baby out.
So what is the magic ingredient at George Mark?
The complex medical diagnoses that bring our young patients to us mean that their lives have often been restricted, some to a hospital bed for long periods of time, others to wheelchairs, still others to intensive courses of chemotherapy or rehab.
We make a practice of ignoring those limitations.
Our default answer is "yes" and our default question is, "Why not?" That's why we took a young boy who wasn't going to live for another baseball season to Game 5 of the World Series.
That's why we have a talent show put on by the staff and kids for family and friends.
Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy playing a piano piece with his feet, because his arms are atrophied?
That's why we have a prom every year.
It's pretty magical.
We started the prom after hearing a dad lament that he would never pin a boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.
The weeks before the dance, the house is in a flurry, and I don't know who's more excited, the staff or the kids.
(Laughter)
The night of the event involves rides in vintage cars, a walk on a red carpet into the great room, a terrific DJ and a photographer at the ready to capture pictures of these attendees and their families.
At the end of the evening this year, one of our young, delightful teenaged girls, Caitlin, said to her mom, "That was the best night of my whole life." And that's just the point, to capture the best days and nights, to abolish limitations, to have your default answer be "yes" and your default question be, "Why not?"
Ultimately life is too short, whether we live to be 85 years or just eight. Trust me. Better yet, trust Sam.
It's not by pretending that death doesn't exist that we keep the people, especially the little people that we love, safe.
In the end, we can't control how long any of us lives.
What we can control is how we spend our days, the spaces we create, the meaning and joy that we make.
We cannot change the outcome, but we can change the journey.
Isn't it time to recognize that children deserve nothing less than our most uncompromising bravery and our wildest imagination.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What if our plants could sense the toxicity levels in the soil and express that toxicity through the color of its leaves?
What if those plants could also remove those toxins from the soil?
Instead, what if those plants grew their own packaging, or were designed to only be harvested by their owners' own patented machines?
What happens when biological design is driven by the motivations of mass-produced commodities?
What kind of world would that be?
My name is Ani, and I'm a designer and researcher at MIT Media Lab, where I'm part of a relatively new and unique group called Design Fiction, where we're wedged somewhere between science fiction and science fact.
And at MIT, I am lucky enough to rub shoulders with scientists studying all kinds of cutting edge fields like synthetic neurobiology, artificial intelligence, artificial life and everything in between.
And across campus, there's truly brilliant scientists asking questions like, "How can I make the world a better place?" And part of what my group likes to ask is, "What is better?" What is better for you, for me, for a white woman, a gay man, a veteran, a child with a prosthetic?
Technology is never neutral.
It frames a reality and reflects a context.
Can you imagine what it would say about the work-life balance at your office if these were standard issue on the first day?
(Laughter)
I believe it's the role of artists and designers to raise critical questions.
Art is how you can see and feel the future, and today is an exciting time to be a designer, for all the new tools becoming accessible.
For instance, synthetic biology seeks to write biology as a design problem.
And through these developments, my lab asks, what are the roles and responsibilities of an artist, designer, scientist or businessman?
What are the implications of synthetic biology, genetic engineering, and how are they shaping our notions of what it means to be a human?
What are the implications of this on society, on evolution and what are the stakes in this game?
My own speculative design research at the current moment plays with synthetic biology, but for more emotionally driven output.
I'm obsessed with olfaction as a design space, and this project started with this idea of what if you could take a smell selfie, a smelfie?
(Laughter)
What if you could take your own natural body odor and send it to a lover?
Funny enough, I found that this was a 19th century Austrian tradition, where couples in courtship would keep a slice of apple crammed under their armpit during dances, and at the end of the evening, the girl would give the guy she most fancied her used fruit, and if the feeling was mutual, he would wolf down that stinky apple.
(Laughter)
Famously, Napoleon wrote many love letters to Josephine, but perhaps amongst the most memorable is this brief and urgent note: "Home in three days.
Don't bathe. "
(Laughter)
Both Napoleon and Josephine adored violets.
Josephine wore violet-scented perfume, carried violets on their wedding day, and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets every year on their anniversary.
When Josephine passed away, he planted violets at her grave, and just before his exile, he went back to that tomb site, picked some of those flowers, entombed them in a locket and wore them until the day he died.
And I found this so moving, I thought, could I engineer that violet to smell just like Josephine?
What if, for the rest of eternity, when you went to visit her site, you could smell Josephine just as Napoleon loved her?
Could we engineer new ways of mourning, new rituals for remembering?
After all, we've engineered transgenic crops to be maximized for profit, crops that stand up to transport, crops that have a long shelf life, crops that taste sugary sweet but resist pests, sometimes at the expense of nutritional value.
Can we harness these same technologies for an emotionally sensitive output?
So currently in my lab, I'm researching questions like, what makes a human smell like a human?
And it turns out it's fairly complicated.
Factors such as your diet, your medications, your lifestyle all factor into the way you smell.
And I found that our sweat is mostly odorless, but it's our bacteria and microbiome that's responsible for your smells, your mood, your identity and so much beyond.
And there's all kinds of molecules that you emit but which we only perceive subconsciously.
So I've been cataloging and collecting bacteria from different sites of my body.
After talking to a scientist, we thought, maybe the perfect concoction of Ani is like 10 percent collarbone, 30 percent underarm, 40 percent bikini line and so forth, and occasionally I let researchers from other labs take a sniff of my samples.
And it's been interesting to hear how smell of the body is perceived outside of the context of the body.
I've gotten feedback such as, smells like flowers, like chicken, like cornflakes, like beef carnitas.
(Laughter)
At the same time, I cultivate a set of carnivorous plants for their ability to emit fleshlike odors to attract prey, in an attempt to kind of create this symbiotic relationship between my bacteria and this organism.
And as it so happens, I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar, and I was talking to a scientist who happens to be a chemist and a plant scientist, and I was telling him about my project, and he was like, "Well, this sounds like botany for lonely women."
(Laughter)
Unperturbed, I said, "OK." I challenged him. "Can we engineer a plant that can love me back?" And for some reason, he was like, "Sure, why not?"
So we started with, can we get a plant to grow towards me like I was the sun?
And so we're looking at mechanisms in plants such as phototropism, which causes the plant to grow towards the sun by producing hormones like auxin, which causes cell elongation on the shady side.
And right now I'm creating a set of lipsticks that are infused with these chemicals that allow me to interact with a plant on its own chemical signatures -- lipsticks that cause plants to grow where I kiss it, plants that blossom where I kiss the bloom.
And through these projects, I'm asking questions like, how do we define nature?
How do we define nature when we can reengineer its properties, and when should we do it?
Should we do it for profit, for utility?
Can we do it for emotional ends?
Can biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music?
What are the thresholds between science and its ability to shape our emotional landscape?
It's a famous design mantra that form follows function.
Well, now, wedged somewhere between science, design and art I get to ask, what if fiction informs fact?
What kind of R & amp; D lab would that look like and what kind of questions would we ask together?
We often look to technology as the answer, but as an artist and designer, I like to ask, but what is the question?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Eight years ago, I was haunted by an evil spirit.
I was 25 at the time, and I was living in a tiny house behind someone else's house in Los Angeles.
It was this guest house, it had kind of been dilapidated, not taken care of for a long time.
And one night, I was sitting there and I got this really spooky feeling, kind of the feeling like you're being watched.
But no one was there except my two dogs, and they were just chewing their feet.
And I looked around.
No one was there.
And I thought, OK, it's just my imagination.
But the feeling just kept getting worse, and I started to feel this pressure in my chest, sort of like the feeling when you get bad news.
But it started to sink lower and lower and almost hurt.
And over the course of that week, this feeling got worse and worse, and I started to become convinced that something was there in my little guest house, haunting me.
And I started to hear these sounds, this "whoosh," kind of whisper, like something passing through me.
I called my best friend, Claire, and said, "I know this is going to sound crazy, but, um... I think there's a ghost in my house, and I need to get rid of it." And she said — she's very open-minded — and she said, "I don't think you're crazy.
I think you just need to do a cleansing ritual."
(Laughter)
"So get some sage and burn it, and tell it to go away."
So I said, "OK," and I went and I bought sage.
I had never done this before, so I set the sage on fire, waved it about, and said, "Go away!
This is my house! I live here. You don't live here! "But the feeling stayed. Nothing got better. And then I started to think, OK, well now this thing is probably just laughing at me, because it hasn't left, and I probably just look like this impotent, powerless thing that couldn't get it to go away.
So every day I'd come home and you guys, this feeling got so bad that -- I mean, I'm laughing at it now -- but I would sit there in bed and cry every night.
And the feeling on my chest got worse and worse. It was physically painful.
And I even went to a psychiatrist and tried to get her to prescribe me medicine, and she wouldn't just because I don't have schizophrenia, OK.
(Laughter) So finally I got on the internet, and I Googled "hauntings." And I came upon this forum of ghost hunters.
But these were a special kind of ghost hunters -- they were skeptics.
They believed that every case of ghosts that they had investigated so far had been explained away by science.
And I was like, "OK, smart guys, this is what's happening to me, and if you have an explanation for me, I would love to hear it."
And one of them said, "OK. Um, have you heard of carbon monoxide poisoning?"
And I said, "Yeah. Like, gas poisoning?"
Carbon monoxide poisoning is when you have a gas leak leaking into your home.
I looked it up, and the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include a pressure on your chest, auditory hallucinations -- whoosh -- and an unexplained feeling of dread.
So that night, I called the gas company. I said, "I have an emergency. I need you to come out.
I don't want to get into the story now, but I need you to come out."
(Laughter)
They came out. I said, "I suspect a gas leak." They brought their carbon monoxide detector, and the man said, "It's a really good thing that you called us tonight, because you could have been dead very soon."
Thirty-seven percent of Americans believe in haunted houses, and I wonder how many of them have been in one and how many of them have been in danger.
So that haunting story has led me to my job.
I'm an investigator, and I'm an investigator in two senses: I'm an investigative journalist, and I'm also an investigator of the claims of the paranormal and claims of the spiritual.
And that means a few things.
Sometimes that means that I'm pretending to need an exorcism so I can get -- yes, that's right! -- so I can go to an exorcist and see if he's using gimmicks or psychological tricks to try to convince someone that they're possessed.
Sometimes that means I'm going undercover in a fringe group which I report on for a podcast that I co-host.
And I've done over 70 investigations like this with my co-host, Ross.
I would love to tell you that nine times out of 10, science wins, saves the day, it's all explained.
That's not true.
The truth is, 10 times out of 10, science wins, it saves the day.
(Applause)
And that doesn't mean there's no such thing as a mystery.
Of course there are mysteries, but a mystery is a mystery.
It is not a ghost.
Now, I believe there are two kinds of truth, and it's taken me a while to get to this place, but I think this is right, so hear me out.
I think there is outer truth and there's inner truth.
So if you say to me, "There was a man named Jesus and he once existed," that's outer truth, right?
And we can go and look at the historical record.
We can determine whether that seems to be true.
And I would argue, it does seem to be true.
If you say, "Jesus rose from the dead," -- ooh, trickier.
(Laughter)
I would say that's an outer-truth claim, because he physically rose or he didn't.
I'm not going to get into whether he rose or he didn't, but I would say that's an outer-truth claim.
It happened or it didn't happen.
But if you say, "I don't care whether he rose from the dead.
It's symbolically important to me, and that metaphor is so meaningful, so purposeful to me, and I'm not going to try to persuade you of it," now you've moved it from outer truth to inner truth, from science to art.
And I think we have a tendency to not be clear about this, to try to move our inner truths to outer truths, or to not be fair about it to each other, and when people are telling us their inner truths, to try to make them defend them by outer-truth standards.
So I'm talking here about outer truth, about objective things.
And there was an objective reality in my haunted house, right?
Now that I've told you about the gas leak, I doubt a single person here would be like, "I still think there was a ghost, too" --
(Laughter)
because as soon as we have these scientific explanations, we know to give up the ghost.
We use these things as stopgaps for things that we can't explain.
We don't believe them because of evidence; we believe them because of a lack of evidence.
So there is a group in Los Angeles called the Independent Investigations Group, or the IIG, and they do great work.
They'll give a $10,000 prize to anyone who can show, under scientific conditions, that they have a paranormal ability.
No one's done it yet, but they've had a couple people who claim that they were clairaudients, which means that they can hear voices either from the great beyond or they can read minds.
And they had one person who was very sincere, who believed that he could read minds.
So they set up a test with him, and this is the way it always works.
The group says, "OK, we have a protocol, we have a way to scientifically test this.
Do you agree with it? "The person says yes.
Then they test it.
It's very important that both sides agree.
They did that, they tested him.
They said, "OK, you know what?
You weren't able to predict what Lisa was thinking.
It matched up about the same as chance.
Looks like you don't have the power."
And that gave them the opportunity to compassionately sit down with him and have a very difficult discussion, which basically amounted to, "Hey, we know you're sincere, and what that means is, you do hear something in your head."
And that guy got to make the very difficult decision, but really the life-changing decision about whether to go get help.
We're actually helping people to make these connections that maybe before seemed like otherworldly explanations, help draw us into reality and maybe change our lives for the better.
Now, on the other hand, maybe one time it'll turn out to be true.
Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts, and holy shit, it will be the best thing!
And every time I do one of these investigations, I still get so excited, and I'm like 75 into them, and still I swear on number 76, I'm going to be like, "This is the one!"
Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic, but I hope I never lose this hope, and I invite you to take this same attitude when people share their outer beliefs with you.
When talking about testable claims, respect them enough to ask these good questions.
Challenge and see how you can examine them together, because there's this idea that you can't respect a belief and still challenge it, but that's not true.
When we jiggle the lock, when we test the claim, we're saying, OK, I respect you, I'm listening to what you're saying, I'm going to test it out with you.
We've all had that experience where you're telling someone something, and they're like, "Oh, that's really interesting, yeah," you know you're being had.
But when someone says, "Really? Huh. Sounds a little sketchy to me, but I'm listening," you at least know you're being engaged and respected.
And that's the kind of attitude we should have with these claims.
That's showing someone that you care what they're saying. That's respect.
Now, yes, most of these searches will come up empty, but that's how all of science works.
Every cure for cancer so far has not panned out, but we don't stop looking, for two reasons.
Because number one, the answer matters.
Whether it's looking at the afterlife or the paranormal or the cure for cancer, it all amounts to the same question: How long will we be here?
And two, because looking for the truth, being open-minded, and being willing to be wrong and to change your whole worldview is awe-inspiring.
I still get excited at ghost stories every single time.
I still consider that every group I join might be right, and I hope I never lose that hope.
Let's all never lose that hope, because searching for what's out there helps us understand what's in here.
And also, please have a carbon monoxide detector in your home.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was a blue-eyed, chubby-cheeked five-year-old when I joined my family on the picket line for the first time.
My mom made me leave my dolls in the minivan.
I'd stand on a street corner in the heavy Kansas humidity, surrounded by a few dozen relatives, with my tiny fists clutching a sign that I couldn't read yet: "Gays are worthy of death." This was the beginning.
Our protests soon became a daily occurrence and an international phenomenon, and as a member of Westboro Baptist Church, I became a fixture on picket lines across the country.
The end of my antigay picketing career and life as I knew it, came 20 years later, triggered in part by strangers on Twitter who showed me the power of engaging the other.
In my home, life was framed as an epic spiritual battle between good and evil.
The good was my church and its members, and the evil was everyone else.
My church's antics were such that we were constantly at odds with the world, and that reinforced our otherness on a daily basis. "Make a difference between the unclean and the clean," the verse says, and so we did.
From baseball games to military funerals, we trekked across the country with neon protest signs in hand to tell others exactly how "unclean" they were and exactly why they were headed for damnation.
This was the focus of our whole lives.
This was the only way for me to do good in a world that sits in Satan's lap.
And like the rest of my 10 siblings, I believed what I was taught with all my heart, and I pursued Westboro's agenda with a special sort of zeal.
In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter.
Initially, the people I encountered on the platform were just as hostile as I expected.
They were the digital version of the screaming hordes I'd been seeing at protests since I was a kid.
But in the midst of that digital brawl, a strange pattern developed.
Someone would arrive at my profile with the usual rage and scorn, I would respond with a custom mix of Bible verses, pop culture references and smiley faces.
They would be understandably confused and caught off guard, but then a conversation would ensue.
And it was civil — full of genuine curiosity on both sides.
How had the other come to such outrageous conclusions about the world?
Sometimes the conversation even bled into real life.
People I'd sparred with on Twitter would come out to the picket line to see me when I protested in their city.
A man named David was one such person.
He ran a blog called "Jewlicious," and after several months of heated but friendly arguments online, he came out to see me at a picket in New Orleans.
He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert from Jerusalem, where he lives, and I brought him kosher chocolate and held a "God hates Jews" sign.
(Laughter)
There was no confusion about our positions, but the line between friend and foe was becoming blurred.
We'd started to see each other as human beings, and it changed the way we spoke to one another.
It took time, but eventually these conversations planted seeds of doubt in me.
My friends on Twitter took the time to understand Westboro's doctrines, and in doing so, they were able to find inconsistencies I'd missed my entire life.
Why did we advocate the death penalty for gays when Jesus said, "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?" How could we claim to love our neighbor while at the same time praying for God to destroy them?
The truth is that the care shown to me by these strangers on the internet was itself a contradiction.
It was growing evidence that people on the other side were not the demons I'd been led to believe.
These realizations were life-altering. Once I saw that we were not the ultimate arbiters of divine truth but flawed human beings, I couldn't pretend otherwise.
I couldn't justify our actions -- especially our cruel practice of protesting funerals and celebrating human tragedy.
These shifts in my perspective contributed to a larger erosion of trust in my church, and eventually it made it impossible for me to stay.
In spite of overwhelming grief and terror, I left Westboro in 2012.
In those days just after I left, the instinct to hide was almost paralyzing.
I wanted to hide from the judgement of my family, who I knew would never speak to me again -- people whose thoughts and opinions had meant everything to me.
And I wanted to hide from the world I'd rejected for so long -- people who had no reason at all to give me a second chance after a lifetime of antagonism.
And yet, unbelievably, they did.
The world had access to my past because it was all over the internet -- thousands of tweets and hundreds of interviews, everything from local TV news to "The Howard Stern Show" -- but so many embraced me with open arms anyway.
I wrote an apology for the harm I'd caused, but I also knew that an apology could never undo any of it.
All I could do was try to build a new life and find a way somehow to repair some of the damage.
People had every reason to doubt my sincerity, but most of them didn't.
And — given my history, it was more than I could've hoped for — forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.
It still amazes me.
I spent my first year away from home adrift with my younger sister, who had chosen to leave with me.
We walked into an abyss, but we were shocked to find the light and a way forward in the same communities we'd targeted for so long.
David, my "Jewlicious" friend from Twitter, invited us to spend time among a Jewish community in Los Angeles.
We slept on couches in the home of a Hasidic rabbi and his wife and their four kids -- the same rabbi that I'd protested three years earlier with a sign that said, "Your rabbi is a whore." We spent long hours talking about theology and Judaism and life while we washed dishes in their kosher kitchen and chopped vegetables for dinner.
They treated us like family.
They held nothing against us, and again I was astonished.
That period was full of turmoil, but one part I've returned to often is a surprising realization I had during that time -- that it was a relief and a privilege to let go of the harsh judgments that instinctively ran through my mind about nearly every person I saw.
I realized that now I needed to learn. I needed to listen.
This has been at the front of my mind lately, because I can't help but see in our public discourse so many of the same destructive impulses that ruled my former church.
We celebrate tolerance and diversity more than at any other time in memory, and still we grow more and more divided.
We want good things -- justice, equality, freedom, dignity, prosperity -- but the path we've chosen looks so much like the one I walked away from four years ago.
We've broken the world into us and them, only emerging from our bunkers long enough to lob rhetorical grenades at the other camp.
We write off half the country as out-of-touch liberal elites or racist misogynist bullies.
No nuance, no complexity, no humanity.
Even when someone does call for empathy and understanding for the other side, the conversation nearly always devolves into a debate about who deserves more empathy.
And just as I learned to do, we routinely refuse to acknowledge the flaws in our positions or the merits in our opponent's. Compromise is anathema. We even target people on our own side when they dare to question the party line.
This path has brought us cruel, sniping, deepening polarization, and even outbreaks of violence.
I remember this path.
It will not take us where we want to go.
What gives me hope is that we can do something about this.
The good news is that it's simple, and the bad news is that it's hard.
We have to talk and listen to people we disagree with.
It's hard because we often can't fathom how the other side came to their positions.
It's hard because righteous indignation, that sense of certainty that ours is the right side, is so seductive.
It's hard because it means extending empathy and compassion to people who show us hostility and contempt.
The impulse to respond in kind is so tempting, but that isn't who we want to be. We can resist. And I will always be inspired to do so by those people I encountered on Twitter, apparent enemies who became my beloved friends.
And in the case of one particularly understanding and generous guy, my husband.
There was nothing special about the way I responded to him.
What was special was their approach.
I thought about it a lot over the past few years and I found four things they did differently that made real conversation possible.
These four steps were small but powerful, and I do everything I can to employ them in difficult conversations today.
The first is don't assume bad intent.
My friends on Twitter realized that even when my words were aggressive and offensive, I sincerely believed I was doing the right thing.
Assuming ill motives almost instantly cuts us off from truly understanding why someone does and believes as they do.
We forget that they're a human being with a lifetime of experience that shaped their mind, and we get stuck on that first wave of anger, and the conversation has a very hard time ever moving beyond it.
But when we assume good or neutral intent, we give our minds a much stronger framework for dialogue.
The second is ask questions.
When we engage people across ideological divides, asking questions helps us map the disconnect between our differing points of view.
That's important because we can't present effective arguments if we don't understand where the other side is actually coming from and because it gives them an opportunity to point out flaws in our positions.
But asking questions serves another purpose; it signals to someone that they're being heard.
When my friends on Twitter stopped accusing and started asking questions, I almost automatically mirrored them.
Their questions gave me room to speak, but they also gave me permission to ask them questions and to truly hear their responses.
It fundamentally changed the dynamic of our conversation.
The third is stay calm.
This takes practice and patience, but it's powerful.
At Westboro, I learned not to care how my manner of speaking affected others.
I thought my rightness justified my rudeness -- harsh tones, raised voices, insults, interruptions -- but that strategy is ultimately counterproductive.
Dialing up the volume and the snark is natural in stressful situations, but it tends to bring the conversation to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.
When my husband was still just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance, our discussions frequently became hard and pointed, but we always refused to escalate.
Instead, he would change the subject.
He would tell a joke or recommend a book or gently excuse himself from the conversation.
We knew the discussion wasn't over, just paused for a time to bring us back to an even keel.
People often lament that digital communication makes us less civil, but this is one advantage that online conversations have over in-person ones.
We have a buffer of time and space between us and the people whose ideas we find so frustrating.
We can use that buffer.
Instead of lashing out, we can pause, breathe, change the subject or walk away, and then come back to it when we're ready.
And finally... make the argument.
This might seem obvious, but one side effect of having strong beliefs is that we sometimes assume that the value of our position is or should be obvious and self-evident, that we shouldn't have to defend our positions because they're so clearly right and good that if someone doesn't get it, it's their problem -- that it's not my job to educate them.
But if it were that simple, we would all see things the same way.
As kind as my friends on Twitter were, if they hadn't actually made their arguments, it would've been so much harder for me to see the world in a different way.
We are all a product of our upbringing, and our beliefs reflect our experiences.
We can't expect others to spontaneously change their own minds.
If we want change, we have to make the case for it.
My friends on Twitter didn't abandon their beliefs or their principles -- only their scorn.
They channeled their infinitely justifiable offense and came to me with pointed questions tempered with kindness and humor.
They approached me as a human being, and that was more transformative than two full decades of outrage, disdain and violence.
I know that some might not have the time or the energy or the patience for extensive engagement, but as difficult as it can be, reaching out to someone we disagree with is an option that is available to all of us.
And I sincerely believe that we can do hard things, not just for them but for us and our future.
Escalating disgust and intractable conflict are not what we want for ourselves, or our country or our next generation.
My mom said something to me a few weeks before I left Westboro, when I was desperately hoping there was a way I could stay with my family.
People I have loved with every pulse of my heart since even before I was that chubby-cheeked five-year-old, standing on a picket line holding a sign I couldn't read.
She said, "You're just a human being, my dear, sweet child." She was asking me to be humble -- not to question but to trust God and my elders.
But to me, she was missing the bigger picture -- that we're all just human beings.
That we should be guided by that most basic fact, and approach one another with generosity and compassion.
Each one of us contributes to the communities and the cultures and the societies that we make up.
The end of this spiral of rage and blame begins with one person who refuses to indulge these destructive, seductive impulses.
We just have to decide that it's going to start with us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was a kid, I was obsessed with the Guinness Book of World Records, and I really wanted to set a world record myself.
But there was just one small problem: I had absolutely no talent.
So I decided to set a world record in something that demanded absolutely no skill at all.
I decided to set a world record in crawling.
(Laughter)
Now, the record at the time was 12 and a half miles, and for some reason, this seemed totally manageable.
(Laughter)
I recruited my friend Anne, and together we decided, we didn't even need to train.
(Laughter)
And on the day of our record attempt, we put furniture pads on the outside of our good luck jeans and we set off, and right away, we were in trouble, because the denim was against our skin and it began to chafe, and soon our knees were being chewed up.
Hours in, it began to rain.
Then, Anne dropped out.
Then, it got dark.
Now, by now, my knees were bleeding through my jeans, and I was hallucinating from the cold and the pain and the monotony.
And to give you an idea of the suffer-fest that I was undergoing, the first lap around the high school track took 10 minutes.
The last lap took almost 30.
After 12 hours of crawling, I stopped, and I had gone eight and a half miles.
So I was short of the 12-and-a-half-mile record.
Now, for many years, I thought this was a story of abject failure, but today I see it differently, because when I was attempting the world record, I was doing three things. I was getting outside my comfort zone, I was calling upon my resilience, and I was finding confidence in myself and my own decisions.
I didn't know it then, but those are not the attributes of failure.
Those are the attributes of bravery.
Now, in 1989, at the age of 26, I became a San Francisco firefighter, and I was the 15th woman in a department of 1,500 men.
(Applause)
And as you can imagine, when I arrived there were many doubts about whether we could do the job.
So even though I was a 5 '10 ", 150-pound collegiate rower, and someone who could endure 12 hours of searing knee pain —
(Laughter)
I knew I still had to prove my strength and fitness.
So one day a call came in for a fire, and sure enough, when my engine group pulled up, there was black smoke billowing from a building off an alleyway.
And I was with a big guy named Skip, and he was on the nozzle, and I was right behind, and it was a typical sort of fire.
It was smoky, it was hot, and all of a sudden, there was an explosion, and Skip and I were blown backwards, my mask was knocked sideways, and there was this moment of confusion.
And then I picked myself up, I groped for the nozzle, and I did what a firefighter was supposed to do: I lunged forward, opened up the water and I tackled the fire myself.
The explosion had been caused by a water heater, so nobody was hurt, and ultimately it was not a big deal, but later Skip came up to me and said, "Nice job, Caroline," in this surprised sort of voice.
(Laughter)
And I was confused, because the fire hadn't been difficult physically, so why was he looking at me with something like astonishment?
And then it became clear: Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy and an excellent firefighter, not only thought that women could not be strong, he thought that they could not be brave either.
And he wasn't the only one.
Friends, acquaintances and strangers, men and women throughout my career ask me over and over, "Caroline, all that fire, all that danger, aren't you scared?" Honestly, I never heard a male firefighter asked this.
And I became curious.
Why wasn't bravery expected of women?
Now, the answer began to come when a friend of mine lamented to me that her young daughter was a big scaredy-cat, and so I began to notice, and yes, the daughter was anxious, but more than that, the parents were anxious.
Most of what they said to her when she was outside began with, "Be careful," "Watch out," or "No." Now, my friends were not bad parents.
They were just doing what most parents do, which is cautioning their daughters much more than they caution their sons.
There was a study involving a playground fire pole, ironically, in which researchers saw that little girls were very likely to be warned by both their moms and dads about the fire pole's risk, and if the little girls still wanted to play on the fire pole, a parent was very likely to assist her.
But the little boys?
They were encouraged to play on the fire pole despite any trepidations that they might have, and often the parents offered guidance on how to use it on their own.
So what message does this send to both boys and girls?
Well, that girls are fragile and more in need of help, and that boys can and should master difficult tasks by themselves. It says that girls should be fearful and boys should be gutsy.
Now, the irony is that at this young age, girls and boys are actually very alike physically.
In fact, girls are often stronger until puberty, and more mature.
And yet we adults act as if girls are more fragile and more in need of help, and they can't handle as much.
This is the message that we absorb as kids, and this is the message that fully permeates as we grow up.
We women believe it, men believe it, and guess what?
As we become parents, we pass it on to our children, and so it goes.
Well, so now I had my answer.
This is why women, even firewomen, were expected to be scared.
This is why women often are scared.
Now, I know some of you won't believe me when I tell you this, but I am not against fear.
I know it's an important emotion, and it's there to keep us safe.
But the problem is when fear is the primary reaction that we teach and encourage in girls whenever they face something outside their comfort zone.
So I was a paraglider pilot for many years --
(Applause)
and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing, and it does fly very well, but to many people I realize it looks just like a bedsheet with strings attached.
(Laughter)
And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops inflating this bedsheet, running off and flying.
And I know what you're thinking.
You're like, Caroline, a little fear would make sense here. And you're right, it does. I assure you, I did feel fear.
But on that mountaintop, waiting for the wind to come in just right, I felt so many other things, too: exhilaration, confidence.
I knew I was a good pilot. I knew the conditions were good, or I wouldn't be there. I knew how great it was going to be a thousand feet in the air.
So yes, fear was there, but I would take a good hard look at it, assess just how relevant it was and then put it where it belonged, which was more often than not behind my exhilaration, my anticipation and my confidence.
So I'm not against fear.
I'm just pro-bravery.
Now, I'm not saying your girls must be firefighters or that they should be paragliders, but I am saying that we are raising our girls to be timid, even helpless, and it begins when we caution them against physical risk.
The fear we learn and the experiences we don't stay with us as we become women and morphs into all those things that we face and try to shed: our hesitation in speaking out, our deference so that we can be liked and our lack of confidence in our own decisions.
So how do we become brave? Well, here's the good news. Bravery is learned, and like anything learned, it just needs to be practiced.
So first, we have to take a deep breath and encourage our girls to skateboard, climb trees and clamber around on that playground fire pole.
This is what my own mother did.
She didn't know it then, but researchers have a name for this. They call it risky play, and studies show that risky play is really important for kids, all kids, because it teaches hazard assessment, it teaches delayed gratification, it teaches resilience, it teaches confidence.
In other words, when kids get outside and practice bravery, they learn valuable life lessons.
Second, we have to stop cautioning our girls willy-nilly.
So notice next time you say, "Watch out, you're going to get hurt," or, "Don't do that, it's dangerous." And remember that often what you're really telling her is that she shouldn't be pushing herself, that she's really not good enough, that she should be afraid.
Third, we women have to start practicing bravery, too.
We cannot teach our girls until we teach ourselves.
So here's another thing: fear and exhilaration feel very similar -- the shaky hands, the heightened heart rate, the nervous tension, and I'm betting that for many of you the last time you thought you were scared out of your wits, you may have been feeling mostly exhilaration, and now you've missed an opportunity. So practice. And while girls should be getting outside to learn to be gutsy, I get that adults don't want to get on hoverboards or climb trees, so we all should be practicing at home, in the office and even right here getting up the guts to talk to someone that you really admire.
Finally, when your girl is, let's say, on her bike on the top of the steep hill that she insists she's too scared to go down, guide her to access her bravery.
Ultimately, maybe that hill really is too steep, but she'll come to that conclusion through courage, not fear.
Because this is not about the steep hill in front of her.
This is about the life ahead of her and that she has the tools to handle and assess all the dangers that we cannot protect her from, all the challenges that we won't be there to guide her through, everything that our girls here and around the world face in their future.
So by the way, the world record for crawling today --
(Laughter)
is 35.18 miles, and I would really love to see a girl go break that.
(Applause)
Hello, I'm Joy, a poet of code, on a mission to stop an unseen force that's rising, a force that I called "the coded gaze," my term for algorithmic bias.
Algorithmic bias, like human bias, results in unfairness.
However, algorithms, like viruses, can spread bias on a massive scale at a rapid pace.
Algorithmic bias can also lead to exclusionary experiences and discriminatory practices.
Let me show you what I mean. (Video) Joy Buolamwini: Hi, camera.
I've got a face.
Can you see my face? No-glasses face? You can see her face. What about my face? I've got a mask.
Can you see my mask?
Joy Buolamwini: So how did this happen?
Why am I sitting in front of a computer in a white mask, trying to be detected by a cheap webcam?
Well, when I'm not fighting the coded gaze as a poet of code, I'm a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab, and there I have the opportunity to work on all sorts of whimsical projects, including the Aspire Mirror, a project I did so I could project digital masks onto my reflection.
So in the morning, if I wanted to feel powerful, I could put on a lion.
If I wanted to be uplifted, I might have a quote.
So I used generic facial recognition software to build the system, but found it was really hard to test it unless I wore a white mask.
Unfortunately, I've run into this issue before.
When I was an undergraduate at Georgia Tech studying computer science, I used to work on social robots, and one of my tasks was to get a robot to play peek-a-boo, a simple turn-taking game where partners cover their face and then uncover it saying, "Peek-a-boo!" The problem is, peek-a-boo doesn't really work if I can't see you, and my robot couldn't see me.
But I borrowed my roommate's face to get the project done, submitted the assignment, and figured, you know what, somebody else will solve this problem.
Not too long after, I was in Hong Kong for an entrepreneurship competition.
The organizers decided to take participants on a tour of local start-ups.
One of the start-ups had a social robot, and they decided to do a demo.
The demo worked on everybody until it got to me, and you can probably guess it.
It couldn't detect my face.
I asked the developers what was going on, and it turned out we had used the same generic facial recognition software.
Halfway around the world, I learned that algorithmic bias can travel as quickly as it takes to download some files off of the internet.
So what's going on?
Why isn't my face being detected?
Well, we have to look at how we give machines sight.
Computer vision uses machine learning techniques to do facial recognition.
So how this works is, you create a training set with examples of faces.
This is a face. This is a face.
This is not a face. And over time, you can teach a computer how to recognize other faces.
However, if the training sets aren't really that diverse, any face that deviates too much from the established norm will be harder to detect, which is what was happening to me.
But don't worry -- there's some good news.
Training sets don't just materialize out of nowhere.
We actually can create them.
So there's an opportunity to create full-spectrum training sets that reflect a richer portrait of humanity.
Now you've seen in my examples how social robots was how I found out about exclusion with algorithmic bias.
But algorithmic bias can also lead to discriminatory practices.
Across the US, police departments are starting to use facial recognition software in their crime-fighting arsenal.
Georgetown Law published a report showing that one in two adults in the US -- that's 117 million people -- have their faces in facial recognition networks.
Police departments can currently look at these networks unregulated, using algorithms that have not been audited for accuracy.
Yet we know facial recognition is not fail proof, and labeling faces consistently remains a challenge.
You might have seen this on Facebook.
My friends and I laugh all the time when we see other people mislabeled in our photos.
But misidentifying a suspected criminal is no laughing matter, nor is breaching civil liberties.
Machine learning is being used for facial recognition, but it's also extending beyond the realm of computer vision.
In her book, "Weapons of Math Destruction," data scientist Cathy O'Neil talks about the rising new WMDs -- widespread, mysterious and destructive algorithms that are increasingly being used to make decisions that impact more aspects of our lives.
So who gets hired or fired? Do you get that loan? Do you get insurance? Are you admitted into the college you wanted to get into?
Do you and I pay the same price for the same product purchased on the same platform?
Law enforcement is also starting to use machine learning for predictive policing.
Some judges use machine-generated risk scores to determine how long an individual is going to spend in prison.
So we really have to think about these decisions. Are they fair? And we've seen that algorithmic bias doesn't necessarily always lead to fair outcomes. So what can we do about it? Well, we can start thinking about how we create more inclusive code and employ inclusive coding practices.
It really starts with people.
So who codes matters.
Are we creating full-spectrum teams with diverse individuals who can check each other's blind spots?
On the technical side, how we code matters.
Are we factoring in fairness as we're developing systems?
And finally, why we code matters.
We've used tools of computational creation to unlock immense wealth.
We now have the opportunity to unlock even greater equality if we make social change a priority and not an afterthought.
And so these are the three tenets that will make up the "incoding" movement.
Who codes matters, how we code matters and why we code matters.
So to go towards incoding, we can start thinking about building platforms that can identify bias by collecting people's experiences like the ones I shared, but also auditing existing software.
We can also start to create more inclusive training sets.
Imagine a "Selfies for Inclusion" campaign where you and I can help developers test and create more inclusive training sets.
And we can also start thinking more conscientiously about the social impact of the technology that we're developing.
To get the incoding movement started, I've launched the Algorithmic Justice League, where anyone who cares about fairness can help fight the coded gaze.
On codedgaze.com, you can report bias, request audits, become a tester and join the ongoing conversation, # codedgaze.
So I invite you to join me in creating a world where technology works for all of us, not just some of us, a world where we value inclusion and center social change.
Thank you. (Applause) But I have one question: Will you join me in the fight? (Laughter)
Why do we think that stories by men are deemed to be of universal importance, and stories by women are thought to be merely about women?
My grandmother left school when she was 12.
She had 14 children.
My mother left school when she was 15. She was a secretary. I graduated from university to become a theater director, and that progress is entirely to do with the fact that people I'll never meet fought for women to have rights, get the vote, get education, have progress.
And I'm determined to do the same, and obviously you are, too. Why not?
(Applause)
So I started a festival called WOW, Women of the World, seven years ago, and it's now in 20 countries across five continents.
And one of those countries is Somaliland in Africa.
So I traveled there last year, and part of the joy I had in going there was going to these caves.
The Laas Geel caves.
Now, these caves contain some of the oldest cave paintings in the world.
These paintings are thought to be round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.
Art: what humanity has done ever since it evolved.
It's how we speak about ourselves, how we understand our identity, how we look at our surroundings, who we find out about each other because of the meaning of our lives.
That's what art is for.
So look at this little picture. I think it's a little girl.
I thought it was a bit like me when I was a little girl.
And I thought, well, who painted this joyful, youthful figure?
And I asked the curator of the caves.
I said, "Tell me about the men and women who painted these." And he looked at me absolutely askance, and he said, "Women didn't paint these pictures." And I said, "Well, it was 11,000 years ago." I said, "How do you know?"
(Laughter)
And he said, "Women don't do these things.
Men made these marks. Women don't."
Now, I wasn't really surprised, because that's an attitude that I've seen continuously all my life as a theater maker.
We are told that divine knowledge comes down through the masculine, whether it be to the imam, the priest, the rabbi, the holy man.
Similarly, we're told that creative genius resides in the masculine, that it is the masculine that will be able to tell us about who we really are, that the masculine will tell the universal story on behalf of all of us, whereas women artists will really just talk about women's experiences, women's issues only really relevant to women and of passing interest to men -- and really only some men.
And it's that conviction, that that we are taught, that I think colors so much of whether we're prepared to believe that women's stories really matter.
And unless we're prepared to believe that women's stories really matter, then women's rights don't really matter, and then change can't really come.
I want to tell you about two examples of stories that are thought to be of universal importance: "E.T." and "Hamlet."
(Laughter)
So I took my two children when they were little -- Caroline was eight and Robby was five -- to see "E.T." And it's a fantastic story of this little alien who ends up in an American family with a mum, two brothers and a sister, but he wants to go home.
Not only that, but some really bad scientists want to do some experiments on him, and they're looking for him.
So the children have a plot.
They decide they're going to take him back to his spaceship as soon as they can, and they plop him in a bicycle basket, and off they ride.
But unfortunately, the baddies have found out, and they're catching up and they've got sirens and they've got their guns, they've got the loud-hailers, it's terribly frightening, and they're closing up on the children, and the children are never going to make it.
And then all of a sudden, magically, the bikes fly up in the air, over the clouds, over the moon, and they're going to save "E.T."
So I turn to see my children's faces, and Robby is enraptured, he's there with them, he's saving E.T., he's a happy boy.
And I turn to Caroline, and she's crying her eyes out.
And I said, "What's the matter?" And she said, "Why can't I save E.T.?
Why can't I come? "And then all of a sudden I realized: they weren't children; they were boys — all boys.
And Caroline, who had invested so much in E.T., well, she wasn't invited to save him, and she felt humiliated and spurned.
So I wrote to Steven Spielberg --
(Laughter) (Applause)
and I said, "I don't know if you understand the psychological importance of what's happened, and are you prepared to pay for the therapy bills?"
(Laughter)
Twenty years later, I haven't had a word back from him, but I'm still hopeful.
(Laughter)
But I thought it was interesting, because if you read reviews of what he intended with E.T., he says very specifically, "I wanted the world to understand that we should love and embrace difference." But somehow he didn't include the idea of girls' difference in this thinking.
He thought he was writing a story about all humanity.
Caroline thought he was marginalizing half of humanity.
He thought he was writing a story about human goodness; she thought he was writing a lad's heroic adventure.
And this is common. Men feel they have been given the mantle for universal communication, but of course, how could they be?
They are writing from male experience through male's eyes.
We have to have a look at this ourselves.
We have to be prepared to go back through all our books and our films, all our favorite things, and say, "Actually, this is written by a male artist -- not an artist. We have to see that so many of these stories are written through a male perspective.
Which is fine, but then females need to have 50 percent of the rights for the stage, the film, the novel, the place of creativity.
Let me talk about "Hamlet." To be or not to be.
That is the question.
But it's not my question.
My question is: Why was I taught as a young woman that this was the quintessential example of human dilemma and human experience?
It's a marvelous story, but actually, it's about a young man fearful that he won't be able to make it as a powerful figure in a male world unless he takes revenge for his father's murder.
He talks a great deal to us about suicide being an option, but the reality is that the person who actually commits suicide, Ophelia, after she's been humiliated and abused by him, never gets a chance to talk to the audience about her feelings.
And then when he's finished with Ophelia, he turns on his mum, because basically she has the audacity to fall in love with his uncle and enjoy sex.
(Laughter)
It is a great story, but it is a story about male conflict, male dilemma, male struggle.
But I was told this was the story of human beings, despite the fact that it only had two women in it.
And unless I reeducate myself, I am always going to think that women's stories matter less than men's.
A woman could have written "Hamlet," but she would have written it differently, and it wouldn't have had global recognition.
As the writer Margaret Atwood says, "When a man writes about doing the dishes, it's realism.
When a woman writes about doing it, it's an unfortunate genetic disposition."
(Laughter)
Now, this is not just something that belongs to then.
I mean, when I was a young girl, wanting desperately to be a theater director, this is what my male lecturer said to me: "Well, there are three women directors in Britain," he said, "Jude." "There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian, there's Joan Littlewood, who's retired, and there's Buzz Goodbody, who's just killed herself.
So, which of those three would you like to be?"
(Laughter)
Now, leaving aside the disgusting slur on gay women, the fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.
He thought it was silly that I wanted to be a director.
And I told my friend Marin Alsop, the conductor, and she said, "Oh yes, well, my music teacher said exactly the same.
He said, 'Women don't conduct.'" But all these years later, we've made our mark.
You think, "Well, it'll be different now." I'm afraid it's not different now.
The current head of the Paris Conservatoire said recently, "It takes great physical strength to conduct a symphony, and women are too weak."
(Laughter)
The artist George Baselitz said, "Well, the fact is women can't paint.
Well -- they can't paint very well."
The writer V.S. Naipaul said two years ago, "I can read two paragraphs and know immediately if it's written by a woman, and I just stop reading, because it's not worthy of me."
Audience: Whoa!
And it goes on.
We have to find a way of stopping young girls and women feeling not only that their story doesn't matter, but they're not allowed to be the storyteller.
Because once you feel that you can't stand in the central space and speak on behalf of the world, you will feel that you can offer your goods up to a small, select group.
You will tend to do smaller work on smaller stages, your economic power will be less, your reach of audiences will be less, and your credit will be less as an artist.
And we do finally give artists these incredible, prominent spaces in the world, because they are our storytellers.
Now, why should it matter to you if you're not an artist?
Supposing you're an accountant or an entrepreneur or a medic or a scientist: Should you care about women artists?
Absolutely, you must, because as you can see from the cave paintings, all civilizations, all of humanity have relied upon artists to tell the human story, and if the human story is finally told by men, take my word for it, it will be about men.
So let's make a change. Let's make a change to all our institutions, and not just in the West.
Don't forget -- this message of incapability of women to hold creative genius is being told to girls and women in Nigeria, in China, in Russia, in Indonesia.
All over the world, girls and women are being told that they can't finally hold the idea of creative inspiration.
And I want to ask you: Do you believe that?
Do you believe that women can be a creative genius?
(Applause and cheers)
Well then, please go forward, support women artists, buy their work, insist that their voices are heard, find platforms on which their voices will be made.
And remember this: that in a sense, if we're going to get past this moment of a world where we know that we are unequal, it's artists who have to imagine a different world. And I'm calling on all artists, women and men, to imagine a gender-equal world.
Let's film it. And if we could imagine it, then we would have the energy and the stamina to work towards it.
When I see this little girl, 11,000 years ago, I want to know that the little girl now can stand there and think she's entitled to her dreams, she's entitled to her destiny and she's entitled to speak on behalf of the whole world, be recognized for it and applauded.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I die, I would like for my body to be laid out to be eaten by animals.
Having your body laid out to be eaten by animals is not for everyone. (Laughter)
Maybe you have already had the end-of-life talk with your family and decided on, I don't know, cremation.
And in the interest of full disclosure, what I am proposing for my dead body is not strictly legal at the moment, but it's not without precedent.
We've been laying out our dead for all of human history; it's call exposure burial.
In fact, it's likely happening right now as we speak.
In the mountainous regions of Tibet, they practice "sky burial," a ritual where the body is left to be consumed by vultures.
In Mumbai, in India, those who follow the Parsi religion put their dead in structures called "Towers of Silence." These are interesting cultural tidbits, but they just haven't really been that popular in the Western world -- they're not what you'd expect.
In America, our death traditions have come to be chemical embalming, followed by burial at your local cemetery, or, more recently, cremation.
I myself, am a recent vegetarian, which means I spent the first 30 years or so of my life frantically inhaling animals -- as many as I could get my hands on.
(Laughter) Why, when I die, should they not have their turn with me?
Am I not an animal?
Biologically speaking, are we not all, in this room, animals?
Accepting the fact that we are animals has some potentially terrifying consequences.
It means accepting that we are doomed to decay and die, just like any other creature on earth.
For the last nine years, I've worked in the funeral industry, first as a crematory operator, then as a mortician and most recently, as the owner of my own funeral home.
And I have some good news: if you're looking to avoid the whole "doomed to decay and die" thing: you will have all the help in the world in that avoidance from the funeral industry.
It's a multi-billion-dollar industry, and its economic model is based on the principle of protection, sanitation and beautification of the corpse.
Whether they mean to or not, the funeral industry promotes this idea of human exceptionalism.
It doesn't matter what it takes, how much it costs, how bad it is for the environment, we're going to do it because humans are worth it!
It ignores the fact that death can be an emotionally messy and complex affair, and that there is beauty in decay -- beauty in the natural return to the earth from whence we came.
Now, I don't want you to get me wrong -- I absolutely understand the importance of ritual, especially when it comes to the people that we love.
But we have to be able to create and practice this ritual without harming the environment, which is why we need new options.
So let's return to the idea of protection, sanitation and beautification.
We'll start with a dead body.
The funeral industry will protect your dead body by offering to sell your family a casket made of hardwood or metal with a rubber sealant.
At the cemetery, on the day of burial, that casket will be lowered into a large concrete or metal vault.
We're wasting all of these resources -- concretes, metal, hardwoods -- hiding them in vast underground fortresses.
When you choose burial at the cemetery, your dead body is not coming anywhere near the dirt that surrounds it.
Food for worms you are not.
Next, the industry will sanitize your body through embalming: the chemical preservation of the dead.
This procedure drains your blood and replaces it with a toxic, cancer-causing formaldehyde.
They say they do this for the public health because the dead body can be dangerous, but the doctors in this room will tell you that that claim would only apply if the person had died of some wildly infectious disease, like Ebola.
Even human decomposition, which, let's be honest, is a little stinky and unpleasant, is perfectly safe.
The bacteria that causes disease is not the same bacteria that causes decomposition.
Finally, the industry will beautify the corpse.
They'll tell you that the natural dead body of your mother or father is not good enough as it is.
They'll put it in makeup. They'll put it in a suit. They'll inject dyes so the person looks a little more alive -- just resting.
Embalming is a cheat code, providing the illusion that death and then decay are not the natural end for all organic life on this planet.
Now, if this system of beautification, sanitation, protection doesn't appeal to you, you are not alone.
There is a whole wave of people -- funeral directors, designers, environmentalists -- trying to come up with a more eco-friendly way of death.
For these people, death is not necessarily a pristine, makeup, powder-blue tuxedo kind of affair.
There's no question that our current methods of death are not particularly sustainable, what with the waste of resources and our reliance on chemicals.
Even cremation, which is usually considered the environmentally friendly option, uses, per cremation, the natural gas equivalent of a 500-mile car trip.
So where do we go from here?
Last summer, I was in the mountains of North Carolina, hauling buckets of wood chips in the summer sun.
I was at Western Carolina University at their "Body Farm," more accurately called a "human decomposition facility." Bodies donated to science are brought here, and their decay is studied to benefit the future of forensics.
On this particular day, there were 12 bodies laid out in various stages of decomposition.
Some were skeletonized, one was wearing purple pajamas, one still had blonde facial hair visible.
The forensic aspect is really fascinating, but not actually why I was there.
I was there because a colleague of mine named Katrina Spade is attempting to create a system, not of cremating the dead, but composting the dead.
She calls the system "Recomposition," and we've been doing it with cattle and other livestock for years.
She imagines a facility where the family could come and lay their dead loved one in a nutrient-rich mixture that would, in four-to-six weeks, reduce the body -- bones and all -- to soil.
In those four-to-six weeks, your molecules become other molecules; you literally transform.
How would this fit in with the very recent desire a lot of people seem to have to be buried under a tree, or to become a tree when they die?
In a traditional cremation, the ashes that are left over -- inorganic bone fragments -- form a thick, chalky layer that, unless distributed in the soil just right, can actually hurt or kill the tree.
But if you're recomposed, if you actually become the soil, you can nourish the tree, and become the post-mortem contributor you've always wanted to be -- that you deserve to be.
So that's one option for the future of cremation.
But what about the future of cemeteries?
There are a lot of people who think we shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore because we're running out of land.
But what if we reframed it, and the corpse wasn't the land's enemy, but its potential savior?
I'm talking about conservation burial, where large swaths of land are purchased by a land trust.
The beauty of this is that once you plant a few dead bodies in that land, it can't be touched, it can't be developed on -- hence the term, "conservation burial." It's the equivalent of chaining yourself to a tree post-mortem -- "Hell no, I won't go!
No, really — I can't.
I'm decomposing under here. "
(Laughter)
Any money that the family gives to the cemetery would go back into protecting and managing the land.
There are no headstones and no graves in the typical sense.
The graves are scattered about the property under elegant mounds, marked only by a rock or a small metal disk, or sometimes only locatable by GPS. There's no embalming, no heavy, metal caskets.
My funeral home sells a few caskets made out of things like woven willow and bamboo, but honestly, most of our families just choose a simple shroud.
There are none of the big vaults that most cemeteries require just because it makes it easier for them to landscape.
Families can come here; they can luxuriate in nature; they can even plant a tree or a shrub, though only native plants to the area are allowed.
The dead then blend seamlessly in with the landscape.
There's hope in conservation cemeteries.
They offer dedicated green space in both urban and rural areas.
They offer a chance to reintroduce native plants and animals to a region.
They offer public trails, places for spiritual practice, places for classes and events -- places where nature and mourning meet. Most importantly, they offer us, once again, a chance to just decompose in a hole in the ground.
The soil, let me tell you, has missed us.
I think for a lot of people, they're starting to get the sense that our current funeral industry isn't really working for them.
For many of us, being sanitized and beautified just doesn't reflect us.
It doesn't reflect what we stood for during our lives.
Will changing the way we bury our dead solve climate change? No. But it will make bold moves in how we see ourselves as citizens of this planet.
If we can die in a way that is more humble and self-aware, I believe that we stand a chance.
Thank you.
(Applause)
For several years now, we've been engaged in a national debate about sexual assault on campus.
No question -- it's crucial that young people understand the ground rules for consent, but that's where the conversation about sex is ending.
And in that vacuum of information the media and the Internet -- that new digital street corner -- are educating our kids for us.
If we truly want young people to engage safely, ethically, and yes, enjoyably, it's time to have open honest discussion about what happens after "yes," and that includes breaking the biggest taboo of all and talking to young people about women's capacity for and entitlement to sexual pleasure. Yeah.
(Applause)
Come on, ladies.
(Applause)
I spent three years talking to girls ages 15 to 20 about their attitudes and experience of sex.
And what I found was that while young women may feel entitled to engage in sexual behavior, they don't necessarily feel entitled to enjoy it.
Take this sophomore at the Ivy League college who told me, "I come from a long line of smart, strong women.
My grandmother was a firecracker, my mom is a professional, my sister and I are loud, and that's our form of feminine power. "She then proceeded to describe her sex life to me: a series of one-off hookups, starting when she was 13, that were... not especially responsible, not especially reciprocal and not especially enjoyable.
She shrugged. "I guess we girls are just socialized to be these docile creatures who don't express our wants or needs." "Wait a minute," I replied. "Didn't you just tell me what a smart, strong woman you are?" She hemmed and hawed. "I guess," she finally said, "no one told me that that smart, strong image applies to sex."
I should probably say right up top that despite the hype, teenagers are not engaging in intercourse more often or at a younger age than they were 25 years ago.
They are, however, engaging in other behavior.
And when we ignore that, when we label that as "not sex," that opens the door to risky behavior and disrespect.
That's particularly true of oral sex, which teenagers consider to be less intimate than intercourse.
Girls would tell me, "it's no big deal," like they'd all read the same instruction manual -- at least if boys were on the receiving end.
Young women have lots of reasons for participating.
It made them feel desired; it was a way to boost social status.
Sometimes, it was a way to get out of an uncomfortable situation.
As a freshman at a West Coast college said to me, "A girl will give a guy a blow job at the end of the night because she doesn't want to have sex with him, and he expects to be satisfied.
So, if I want him to leave and I don't want anything to happen ... " I heard so many stories of girls performing one-sided oral sex that I started asking, "What if every time you were alone with a guy, he told you to get him a glass of water from the kitchen, and he never got you a glass of water -- or if he did, it was like ... 'you want me to uh ...?'" You know, totally begrudging.
You wouldn't stand for it.
But it wasn't always that boys didn't want to.
It was that girls didn't want them to.
Girls expressed a sense of shame around their genitals.
A sense that they were simultaneously icky and sacred.
Women's feelings about their genitals have been directly linked to their enjoyment of sex.
Yet, Debby Herbenick, a researcher at Indiana University, believes that girls' genital self-image is under siege, with more pressure than ever to see them as unacceptable in their natural state.
According to research, about three-quarters of college women remove their pubic hair -- all of it -- at least on occasion, and more than half do so regularly.
Girls would tell me that hair removal made them feel cleaner, that it was a personal choice.
Though, I kind of wondered if left alone on a desert island, if this was how they would choose to spend their time.
(Laughter)
And when I pushed further, a darker motivation emerged: avoiding humiliation. "Guys act like they would be disgusted by it," one young woman told me. "No one wants to be talked about like that." The rising pubic hair removal reminded me of the 1920s, when women first started regularly shaving their armpits and their legs.
That's when flapper dresses came into style, and women's limbs were suddenly visible, open to public scrutiny.
There's a way that I think that this too is a sign. That a girl's most intimate part is open to public scrutiny, open to critique, to becoming more about how it looks to someone else than how it feels to her.
The shaving trend has sparked another rise in labiaplasty.
Labiaplasty, which is the trimming of the inner and outer labia, is the fastest-growing cosmetic surgery among teenage girls.
It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015, and whereas girls under 18 comprise two percent of all cosmetic surgeries, they are five percent of labiaplasty.
The most sought-after look, incidentally, in which the outer labia appear fused like a clam shell, is called... wait for it... "The Barbie."
(Groan)
I trust I don't have to tell you that Barbie is a) made of plastic and b) has no genitalia.
(Laughter)
The labiaplasty trend has become so worrisome that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued a statement on the procedure, which is rarely medically indicated, has not been proven safe and whose side effects include scarring, numbness, pain and diminished sexual sensation.
Now, admittedly, and blessedly, the number of girls involved is still quite small, but you could see them as canaries in a coal mine, telling us something important about the way girls see their bodies.
Sara McClellan, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, coined what is my favorite phrase ever in talking about all of this: "Intimate justice." That's the idea that sex has political, as well as personal implications, just like, who does the dishes in your house, or who vacuums the rug.
And it raises similar issues about inequality, about economic disparity, violence, physical and mental health.
Intimate justice asks us to consider who is entitled to engage in an experience.
Who is entitled to enjoy it?
Who is the primary beneficiary?
And how does each partner define "good enough"?
Honestly, I think those questions are tricky and sometimes traumatic for adult women to confront, but when we're talking about girls, I just kept coming back to the idea that their early sexual experience shouldn't have to be something that they get over.
In her work, McClelland found that young women were more likely than young men to use their partner's pleasure as a measure of their satisfaction.
So they'd say things like, "If he's sexually satisfied, then I'm sexually satisfied." Young men were more likely to measure their satisfaction by their own orgasm.
Young women also defined bad sex differently.
In the largest ever survey ever conducted on American sexual behavior, they reported pain in their sexual encounters 30 percent of the time.
They also used words like "depressing," "humiliating," "degrading." The young men never used that language.
So when young women report sexual satisfaction levels that are equal to or greater than young men's -- and they do in research -- that can be deceptive.
If a girl goes into an encounter hoping that it won't hurt, wanting to feel close to her partner and expecting him to have an orgasm, she'll be satisfied if those criteria are met.
And there's nothing wrong with wanting to feel close to your partner, or wanting him to be happy, and orgasm isn't the only measure of an experience ... but absence of pain -- that's a very low bar for your own sexual fulfillment.
Listening to all of this and thinking about it, I began to realize that we performed a kind of psychological clitoridectomy on American girls.
Starting in infancy, parents of baby boys are more likely to name all their body parts, at least they'll say, "here's your pee-pee." Parents of baby girls go right from navel to knees, and they leave this whole situation in here unnamed.
(Laughter)
There's no better way to make something unspeakable than not to name it.
Then kids go into their puberty education classes and they learn that boys have erections and ejaculations, and girls have ... periods and unwanted pregnancy.
And they see that internal diagram of a woman's reproductive system -- you know, the one that looks kind of like a steer head --
(Laughter)
And it always grays out between the legs.
So we never say vulva, we certainly never say clitoris.
No surprise, fewer than half of teenage girls age 14 to 17 have ever masturbated.
And then they go into their partnered experience and we expect that somehow they'll think sex is about them, that they'll be able to articulate their needs, their desires, their limits. It's unrealistic.
Here's something, though. Girls' investment in their partner's pleasure remains regardless of the gender of the partner.
So in same-sex encounters, the orgasm gap disappears.
And young women climax at the same rate as men.
Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me that they felt liberated to get off the script -- free to create an encounter that worked for them.
Gay girls also challenged the idea of first intercourse as the definition of virginity.
Not because intercourse isn't a big deal, but it's worth questioning why we consider this one act, which most girls associate with discomfort or pain, to be the line in the sand of sexual adulthood -- so much more meaningful, so much more transformative than anything else.
And it's worth considering how this is serving girls; whether it's keeping them safer from disease, coercion, betrayal, assault.
Whether it's encouraging mutuality and caring; what it means about the way they see other sex acts; whether it's giving them more control over and joy in their experience, and what it means about gay teens, who can have multiple sex partners without heterosexual intercourse.
So I asked a gay girl that I met, "How'd you know you weren't a virgin anymore?" She said she had to Google it.
(Laughter)
And Google wasn't sure.
(Laughter)
She finally decided that she wasn't a virgin anymore after she'd had her first orgasm with a partner.
And I thought -- whoa.
What if just for a second we imagined that was the definition?
Again, not because intercourse isn't a big deal -- of course it is -- but it isn't the only big deal, and rather than thinking about sex as a race to a goal, this helps us reconceptualize it as a pool of experiences that include warmth, affection, arousal, desire, touch, intimacy.
And it's worth asking young people: who's really the more sexually experienced person?
The one who makes out with a partner for three hours and experiments with sensual tension and communication, or the one who gets wasted at a party and hooks up with a random in order to dump their "virginity" before they get to college?
The only way that shift in thinking can happen though is if we talk to young people more about sex -- if we normalize those discussions, integrating them into everyday life, talking about those intimate acts in a different way -- the way we mostly have changed in the way that we talk about women in the public realm.
Consider a survey of 300 randomly chosen girls from a Dutch and an American university, two similar universities, talking about their early experience of sex.
The Dutch girls embodied everything we say we want from our girls.
They had fewer negative consequences, like disease, pregnancy, regret — more positive outcomes like being able to communicate with their partner, who they said they knew very well; preparing for the experience responsibly; enjoying themselves.
What was their secret?
The Dutch girls said that their doctors, teachers and parents talked to them candidly, from an early age, about sex, pleasure and the importance of mutual trust.
What's more, while American parents weren't necessarily less comfortable talking about sex, we tend to frame those conversations entirely in terms or risk and danger, whereas Dutch parents talk about balancing responsibility and joy.
I have to tell you, as a parent myself, that hit me hard, because I know, had I not delved into that research, I would have talked to my own child about contraception, about disease protection, about consent because I'm a modern parent, and I would have thought ... job well done.
Now I know that's not enough.
I also know what I hope for for our girls.
I want them to see sexuality as a source of self-knowledge, creativity and communication, despite its potential risks.
I want them to be able to revel in their bodies' sensuality without being reduced to it.
I want them to be able to ask for what they want in bed, and to get it.
I want them to be safe from unwanted pregnancy, disease, cruelty, dehumanization, violence.
If they are assaulted, I want them to have recourse from their schools, their employers, the courts.
It's a lot to ask, but it's not too much.
As parents, teachers, advocates and activists, we have raised a generation of girls to have a voice, to expect egalitarian treatment in the home, in the classroom, in the workplace.
Now it's time to demand that intimate justice in their personal lives as well.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today I want to talk about the meaning of words, how we define them and how they, almost as revenge, define us.
The English language is a magnificent sponge.
I love the English language.
I'm glad that I speak it.
But for all that, it has a lot of holes.
In Greek, there's a word, "lachesism" which is the hunger for disaster.
You know, when you see a thunderstorm on the horizon and you just find yourself rooting for the storm.
In Mandarin, they have a word "yù yī" -- I'm not pronouncing that correctly -- which means the longing to feel intensely again the way you did when you were a kid.
In Polish, they have a word "jouska" which is the kind of hypothetical conversation that you compulsively play out in your head.
And finally, in German, of course in German, they have a word called "zielschmerz" which is the dread of getting what you want.
(Laughter)
Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream.
I'm German myself, so I know exactly what that feels like.
Now, I'm not sure if I would use any of these words as I go about my day, but I'm really glad they exist.
But the only reason they exist is because I made them up.
I am the author of "The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows," which I've been writing for the last seven years.
And the whole mission of the project is to find holes in the language of emotion and try to fill them so that we have a way of talking about all those human peccadilloes and quirks of the human condition that we all feel but may not think to talk about because we don't have the words to do it.
And about halfway through this project, I defined "sonder," the idea that we all think of ourselves as the main character and everyone else is just extras.
But in reality, we're all the main character, and you yourself are an extra in someone else's story.
And so as soon as I published that, I got a lot of response from people saying, "Thank you for giving voice to something I had felt all my life but there was no word for that." So it made them feel less alone.
That's the power of words, to make us feel less alone.
And it was not long after that that I started to notice sonder being used earnestly in conversations online, and not long after I actually noticed it, I caught it next to me in an actual conversation in person.
There is no stranger feeling than making up a word and then seeing it take on a mind of its own.
I don't have a word for that yet, but I will.
(Laughter)
I'm working on it.
I started to think about what makes words real, because a lot of people ask me, the most common thing I got from people is, "Well, are these words made up?
I don't really understand. "And I didn't really know what to tell them because once sonder started to take off, who am I to say what words are real and what aren't.
And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs, who described his epiphany as when he realized that most of us, as we go through the day, we just try to avoid bouncing against the walls too much and just sort of get on with things.
But once you realize that people -- that this world was built by people no smarter than you, then you can reach out and touch those walls and even put your hand through them and realize that you have the power to change it.
And when people ask me, "Are these words real?" I had a variety of answers that I tried out.
Some of them made sense. Some of them didn't.
But one of them I tried out was, "Well, a word is real if you want it to be real." The way that this path is real because people wanted it to be there.
(Laughter)
It happens on college campuses all the time. It's called a "desire path."
(Laughter)
But then I decided, what people are really asking when they're asking if a word is real, they're really asking, "Well, how many brains will this give me access to?" Because I think that's a lot of how we look at language.
A word is essentially a key that gets us into certain people's heads.
And if it gets us into one brain, it's not really worth it, not really worth knowing. Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is. A million brains, OK, now we're talking.
And so a real word is one that gets you access to as many brains as you can.
That's what makes it worth knowing.
Incidentally, the realest word of all by this measure is this.
[O.K.]
That's it. The realest word we have.
That is the closest thing we have to a master key.
That's the most commonly understood word in the world, no matter where you are.
The problem with that is, no one seems to know what those two letters stand for.
(Laughter)
Which is kind of weird, right?
I mean, it could be a misspelling of "all correct," I guess, or "old kinderhook." No one really seems to know, but the fact that it doesn't matter says something about how we add meaning to words.
The meaning is not in the words themselves.
We're the ones that pour ourselves into it.
And I think, when we're all searching for meaning in our lives, and searching for the meaning of life, I think words have something to do with that.
And I think if you're looking for the meaning of something, the dictionary is a decent place to start.
It brings a sense of order to a very chaotic universe.
Our view of things is so limited that we have to come up with patterns and shorthands and try to figure out a way to interpret it and be able to get on with our day.
We need words to contain us, to define ourselves.
I think a lot of us feel boxed in by how we use these words.
We forget that words are made up.
It's not just my words. All words are made up, but not all of them mean something.
We're all just sort of trapped in our own lexicons that don't necessarily correlate with people who aren't already like us, and so I think I feel us drifting apart a little more every year, the more seriously we take words.
Because remember, words are not real.
They don't have meaning. We do.
And I'd like to leave you with a reading from one of my favorite philosophers, Bill Watterson, who created "Calvin and Hobbes." He said, "Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement.
To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it is still allowed, and I think you'll be happier for the trouble."
Thank you.
(Applause)
We all have milestones in life that we remember so vividly.
The first one for me was when I was entering kindergarten.
My big brother was in school, and by golly, it was my time.
And I went trottin' down that hallway.
I was so excited, I almost wet myself.
And I go to the door, and there was the teacher with a warm welcome, and she took me into the classroom, showed me my little cubbyhole -- we all remember those little cubbyholes, don't we -- and we put our stuff in there. And then she said, "Go over to the circle and play with the kids until class starts." So I went over there and plopped down like I owned the place, and I'm playing, and all of a sudden, the boy next to me, he was wearing a white shirt with blue shorts. I remember it like it was yesterday.
(Laughter)
And in a louder voice, he said, "Hey, why are you so short?" So I looked up and I said, "What are you talking about? Let's just play. We're happy. I've been waiting for this."
And so we played, and about a minute later, the girl next to him, in a white shirt and a pink skirt, stood up, put her hands on her hips, and said, "Yeah, why do you look so different?" And I went, "What are you talking about?
I don't look different.
I'm not short. Again, let's just play. "
About this time, I looked all around the circle I was in, and all the kids had stopped playing and they were all looking at me.
And I'm thinking -- in today's language, it would be "OMG" or "WTF."
(Laughter)
What just happened?
So all the confidence that I went in with that morning was withering away as the morning went on and the questions kept coming.
And at the end of the morning, before I went home, the teacher had us in a circle, and I actually found myself outside of the circle.
I couldn't look at anybody.
I could not understand what just happened.
And over the next few years, I hated to go out in public.
I felt every stare, every giggle, every pointed finger, not the finger, but every pointed finger, and I hated it.
I would hide behind my parents' legs like nobody could see me.
And as a child, you can't understand another child's curiosity, nor an adult's ignorance.
It became very apparent to me that the real world was not built for someone of my size, both literally or figuratively.
And so I have no anonymity, as you can probably tell, and while you can see my size, we all go through many challenges through our lifetime.
And some you can see, like mine.
Most you can't.
You can't tell if someone's dealing with a mental illness, or they're struggling with their gender identity, they're caring for an aging parent, they're having financial difficulty.
You can't see that kind of stuff.
So while you can see one of my challenges is my size, seeing does not mean you understand what it's truly to be me on a daily basis, or what I go through.
And so I'm here to debunk a myth.
I do not believe you can walk in someone else's shoes, and because of that, we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves.
Simply stated, I will never know what it's like to be you and you will never know what it's like to be me.
I cannot face your fears or chase your dreams, and you can't do that for me, but we can be supportive of each other.
Instead of trying to walk in each other's shoes, we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves.
I learned at an early age that I did have to do some things different than most people, but I also learned there were things I was on equal footing with, and one of those was the classroom.
Heh, heh, heh. I was equal. As a matter of fact, I excelled in the classroom.
This was vitally important, I discovered as I grew older and realized I wasn't going to be able to do a physical job.
I needed an education.
So I went on and got a university degree, but I felt to be one step ahead of everyone for employment, I needed to have an advanced university degree, so I went ahead and got that.
Now I'm ready for my interview.
Remember your first interview? What am I going to wear? What questions? And don't forget that firm handshake.
I was right there with you.
So 24 hours before my interview, a friend of mine who I've known all my life called and said, "Michele, the building you're going in has steps." And she knew I couldn't climb steps.
So suddenly, my focus changed.
In my shoes, I was worried about how am I going to get there?
So I went early and found a loading dock and got in and had a great interview.
They had no idea what I went through for the day and that's OK.
You're probably thinking my greatest challenge that day was the interview, or getting in the building.
In reality, my biggest challenge that day was getting through the loading dock without getting run over.
I am very vulnerable in certain situations: airports, hallways, parking lots, loading docks.
And so I have to be very careful. I have to anticipate and be flexible and move as quickly as I can sometimes.
So I got the job, and in my current role I travel quite a bit.
And travel is a challenge for all of us these days.
And so you probably get to the airport, run through security, get to the gate.
Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat? Did I get my upgrade? Me, first of all, I don't run through anything.
(Laughter)
And I especially don't run through the TSA because I get to experience the personal patdown.
I won't comment on that.
And then I make my way to the gate, and with my gift of gab that my parents said I was born with, I talk to the gate agent, and then I say, "By the way, my scooter weighs this much, I have a dry cell battery, and I can drive it down to the door of the plane." Also, the day before, I had called the city where I'm traveling to to find out where I could rent a scooter in case mine gets broken on the way.
So in my shoes, it's a little bit different.
When I get onto the plane, I use my gift of gab to ask the lady to put my bag up, and they graciously do.
I try not to eat or drink on a plane because I don't want to have to get up and walk on the plane, but nature has its own schedule, and not long ago, it knocked and I answered.
So I walked up to the front of the plane and gabbed with the flight attendant, and said, "Can you watch the door?
I can't reach the lock. "So I'm in there doing my business, and the door flies open.
And there's a gentleman there with a look of horror on his face.
I'm sure I had the same look.
As I came out, I noticed that he was sitting right across from me, and he's in total, complete embarrassment.
So I walk up to him and I quietly go, "Are you going to remember this as much as I am?"
(Laughter)
And he goes, "I think so."
(Laughter)
Now, while he's probably not talking about it publicly, I am.
(Laughter)
But we talked for the rest of the flight, and we got to know each other, our families, sports, work, and when we landed, he said, "Michele, I noticed someone put your bag up.
Can I get that for you?" And I said, "Of course, thank you." And we wished each other well, and the most important thing that day was that he was not going to leave with that embarrassment, that experience of embarrassment.
He won't forget it, and neither will I, but I think he will remember more our chat and our different perspectives.
When you travel internationally, it can be even more challenging in certain ways.
A few years ago, I was in Zanzibar, and I come wheeling in, and think about that. Short, white, blond woman in a chair.
That doesn't probably happen every day.
So I go up, and with my gift of gab, I start to talk to the agent.
So friendly, and I ask about their culture and so forth, and I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.
So I had to kind of say, "Not only do you have to lift my chair, I could use some help getting up the steps." So we got to spend about an hour together while we waited for the flight, and it was the most magnificent hour.
Our perspective changed for both of us that day.
And once I got on the flight, he patted me on the back and wished me well, and I thanked him so much.
And again, I think he's going to remember that experience more than when I first came in, and there was a bit of hesitation.
And as you notice, I get a lot of help.
I would not be where I am today if it was not for my family, my friends, my colleagues and the many strangers that help me every single day of my life.
And it's important that we all have a support system.
Asking for help is a strength, not a weakness.
(Applause)
We all need help throughout our lifetime, but it is just as important that we are part of other people's support systems.
We must adopt that way of giving back.
We all obviously have a role to play in our own successes, but think about the role we have to play in other people's successes, just like people do for me every single day.
It's vitally important that we help each other, because society is increasingly placing people in silos based on biases and ideologies.
And we must look past the surface and be confronted with the truth that none of us are what you can see.
There's more to us than that, and we're all dealing with things that you cannot see.
So living a life free of judgment allows all of us to share those experiences together and have a totally different perspective, just like the couple of people I mentioned earlier in my stories.
So remember, the only shoes you truly can walk in are your own.
I cannot walk in yours.
I know you can't walk in my size 1s --
(Laughter)
but you can try. But we can do something better than that.
With compassion, courage and understanding, we can walk side by side and support one another, and think about how society can change if we all do that instead of judging on only what you can see.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
In the last couple of years, I have produced what I call "The Dead Mall Series," 32 short films and counting about dead malls.
Now, for those of you who are not familiar with what a dead mall is, it's basically a shopping mall that has fallen into hard times.
So it either has few shops and fewer shoppers, or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.
No sale at Penny's.
(Laughter)
I started producing this series in early 2015 after going through kind of a dark period in my life where I just didn't want to create films anymore.
I put my camera away and I just stopped.
So in 2015, I decided to make a short film about the Owings Mills Mall.
Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986.
I should know because I was there on opening day.
I was there with my family, along with every other family in Baltimore, and you had to drive around for 45 minutes just to find a parking spot.
So if you can imagine, that's not happening at the malls today.
My first mall job that I had as a teenager was at a sporting goods store called Herman's World of Sports. Maybe you remember.
(Singing) Herman's World of Sports.
You guys remember that?
(Laughter)
Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.
I worked in a leather goods store, and I also worked in a video store, and not being one who was very fond of the retail arts --
(Laughter)
I got fired from every single job.
(Laughter)
In between these low-paying retail jobs, I did what any normal teenager did in the 1990s. I shoplifted. I'm just kidding.
I hung out with my friends at the mall.
(Laughter)
Everyone's like, "Oh my God, what kind of talk is this?"
(Laughter)
Hanging out at the mall could be fun, but it could be really lame, too, like sharing a cigarette with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat who has put on black lipstick for the night while you're on your break from your crappy minimum wage job.
As I stand here today, Owings Mills has been gutted and it's ready for the wrecking ball.
The last time I was there, it was in the evening, and it was about three days before they closed the mall for good.
And you kind of felt -- they never announced the mall was closing, but you had this sort of feeling, this ominous feeling, that something big was going to happen, like it was the end of the road. It was a very creepy walk through the mall.
Let me show you.
(Music)
So when I started producing "The Dead Mall Series," I put the videos up onto YouTube, and while I thought they were interesting, frankly I didn't think others would share the enthusiasm for such a drab and depressing topic.
But apparently I was wrong, because a lot of people started to comment.
And at first the comments were like -- basically like, "Oh my God, that's the mall from my childhood.
What happened? "And then I would get comments from people who were like," There's a dead mall in my town.
You should come and film it. "So I started to travel around the mid-Atlantic region filming these dead malls. Some were open. Some were abandoned. It was kind of always hard to get into the ones that were abandoned, but I somehow always found a way in.
(Laughter)
The malls that are still open, they always do this weird thing -- like the dead malls.
They'll have three stores left, but they try to spruce it up to make it appear like things are on the up-and-up.
For example, you'll have an empty store and they bring the gate down.
So at Owings Mills, for example, they put this tarp over the gate. Right? And it's got a stock photo of a woman who is so happy and she's holding a blouse, and she's like --
(Laughter)
And then there's a guy standing next to her, with, like, an espresso cup, and he's like --
(Laughter)
And it says, "What brings you today?"
(Laughter)
I wanted to be scared and depressed. Thank you.
So the comments just kept pouring in on the videos, from all over the country, and then all over the world.
And I started to think, this could really be something, but I had to get creative, because I'm like, how long are people going to sit and watch me waddling through an empty mall?
(Laughter)
So the original episodes I filmed with an iPhone.
So I'd walk through the mall with an iPhone, and, you know. Like that.
(Laughter)
And security -- because malls, they don't like photography -- so the security would come up and be like, "Put that away," and I'm like, "OK." So I had to get creative and sneaky, so I started using a hidden camera and different techniques to get the footage that I needed, and basically what I wanted to do was make the video like it was a first-person experience, like you are sitting -- put your headphones on watching the screen -- it's like, you're there in the video, like a video game, basically.
I also started to use music, collaborating with artists who create music called vaporwave. And vaporwave is a music genre that emerged in the early 2010s among internet communities. Here's an example.
(Music)
That's by an artist named Disconscious from an album he did called "Hologram Plaza." So if you look that up, you can hear more of those tunes.
Vaporwave is more than an art form. It's like a movement.
It's nihilistic, it's angsty, but it's somehow comforting.
The whole aesthetic is a way of dealing with things you can't do anything about, like no jobs, or sitting in your parents' basement eating ramen noodles.
Vaporwave came out of this generation's desire to express their hopelessness, the same way that the pre-internet generation did sitting around in the food court.
One of my favorite malls I've been to is in Corpus Christi, and it's called the Sunrise Mall.
When I was a kid, my favorite thing to do was watch movies, and I used to watch movies over and over and over again.
And one of my favorite films was "The Legend of Billie Jean." Now, for those of you who have seen "The Legend of Billie Jean," you'll know that it's a great film. I love it. And Helen Slater and Christian Slater -- and if you didn't know, they are not related.
Many people thought that they were brother and sister. They're not. But anyway, Sunrise Mall was used in the film as a filming location.
The mall is exactly the same as it was in 1984.
We're talking 32 years later. Let me show you.
(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean running across the fountain, being chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends.
And she jumps over here.
And you can see the shot right here is what it looks like today. It's pretty incredible.
I mean, honestly, it's exactly the same.
And there they are falling in the fountain, and she runs up the stairs.
This is a nice shot of the whole thing here.
Dan Bell: I love that so much.
(Laughter)
I always think in my head, if I owned a dead mall -- why don't they embrace their vintage look?
Put in a bar, like, put vegan food in the food court and invite millennials and hipsters to come and drink and eat, and I guarantee you within three weeks H & amp; M and Levi's will be banging on the door trying to get space.
I don't know why they don't do this, but apparently, it's only in my mind, it goes all day.
(Laughter)
Anyway, in closing --
(Laughter)
When they first asked me to do this talk, I said, "Do you have the right person?"
(Laughter)
These talks are supposed to be kind of inspiring and --
(Laughter)
I remembered something, though.
I put my camera down three or four years ago, and it took going to these malls for me to be inspired again.
And to see my audience and people from all over the world writing me and saying, "God, I love your videos," is incredible.
I don't know how to even explain it, as an artist, how fulfilling that is.
If you would have told me a year ago that I would be standing on this stage talking to all of you wonderful people, I would have never believed it.
I am humbled and so appreciative.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Well, as many of you know, the results of the recent election were as follows: Hillary Clinton, the Democratic candidate won a landslide victory with 52 percent of the overall vote.
Jill Stein, the Green candidate, came a distant second, with 19 percent.
Donald J. Trump, the Republic candidate, was hot on her heels with 14 percent, and the remainder of the vote were shared between abstainers and Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate.
(Laughter)
Now, what parallel universe do you suppose I live in?
Well, I don't live in a parallel universe.
I live in the world, and that is how the world voted.
So let me take you back and explain what I mean by that.
In June this year, I launched something called the Global Vote.
And the Global Vote does exactly what it says on the tin.
For the first time in history, it lets anybody, anywhere in the world, vote in the elections of other people's countries. Now, why would you do that? What's the point?
Well, let me show you what it looks like.
You go to a website, rather a beautiful website, and then you select an election.
Here's a bunch that we've already covered.
We do about one a month, or thereabouts.
So you can see Bulgaria, the United States of America, Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Brexit referendum at the end there.
You select the election that you're interested in, and you pick the candidates.
These are the candidates from the recent presidential election in the tiny island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe, 199,000 inhabitants, off the coast of West Africa.
And then you can look at the brief summary of each of those candidates which I dearly hope is very neutral, very informative and very succinct.
And when you've found the one you like, you vote.
These were the candidates in the recent Icelandic presidential election, and that's the way it goes.
So why on earth would you want to vote in another country's election?
Well, the reason that you wouldn't want to do it, let me reassure you, is in order to interfere in the democratic processes of another country.
That's not the purpose at all.
In fact, you can't, because usually what I do is I release the results after the electorate in each individual country has already voted, so there's no way that we could interfere in that process.
But more importantly, I'm not particularly interested in the domestic issues of individual countries.
That's not what we're voting on.
So what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton proposed to do for the Americans is frankly none of our business.
That's something that only the Americans can vote on.
No, in the global vote, you're only considering one aspect of it, which is what are those leaders going to do for the rest of us?
And that's so very important because we live, as no doubt you're sick of hearing people tell you, in a globalized, hyperconnected, massively interdependent world where the political decisions of people in other countries can and will have an impact on our lives no matter who we are, no matter where we live.
Like the wings of the butterfly beating on one side of the Pacific that can apparently create a hurricane on the other side, so it is with the world that we live in today and the world of politics.
There is no longer a dividing line between domestic and international affairs.
Any country, no matter how small, even if it's São Tomé and Príncipe, could produce the next Nelson Mandela or the next Stalin.
They could pollute the atmosphere and the oceans, which belong to all of us, or they could be responsible and they could help all of us.
And yet, the system is so strange because the system hasn't caught up with this globalized reality.
Only a small number of people are allowed to vote for those leaders, even though their impact is gigantic and almost universal.
What number was it?
140 million Americans voted for the next president of the United States, and yet, as all of us knows, in a few weeks time, somebody is going to hand over the nuclear launch codes to Donald J. Trump.
Now, if that isn't having a potential impact on all of us, I don't know what is.
Similarly, the election for the referendum on the Brexit vote, a small number of millions of British people voted on that, but the outcome of the vote, whichever way it went, would have had a significant impact on the lives of tens, hundreds of millions of people around the world.
And yet, only a tiny number could vote.
What kind of democracy is that?
Huge decisions that affect all of us being decided by relatively very small numbers of people.
And I don't know about you, but I don't think that sounds very democratic.
So I'm trying to clear it up.
But as I say, we don't ask about domestic questions.
In fact, I only ever ask two questions of all of the candidates.
I send them the same two questions every single time.
I say, one, if you get elected, what are you going to do for the rest of us, for the remainder of the seven billion who live on this planet? Second question: What is your vision for your country's future in the world?
What role do you see it playing? Every candidate, I send them those questions.
They don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.
I reckon if you're standing to become the next president of the United States, you're probably pretty tied up most of the time, so I'm not altogether surprised that they don't all answer, but many do. More every time. And some of them do much more than answer.
Some of them answer in the most enthusiastic and most exciting way you could imagine.
I just want to say a word here for Saviour Chishimba, who was one of the candidates in the recent Zambian presidential election.
His answers to those two questions were basically an 18-page dissertation on his view of Zambia's potential role in the world and in the international community.
I posted it on the website so anybody could read it.
Now, Saviour won the global vote, but he didn't win the Zambian election.
So I found myself wondering, what am I going to do with this extraordinary group of people?
I've got some wonderful people here who won the global vote.
We always get it wrong, by the way.
The one that we elect is never the person who's elected by the domestic electorate.
That may be partly because we always seem to go for the woman.
But I think it may also be a sign that the domestic electorate is still thinking very nationally.
They're still thinking very inwardly.
They're still asking themselves: What's in it for me? ... instead of what they should be asking today, which is, what's in it for we?
But there you go. So suggestions, please, not right now, but send me an email if you've got an idea about what we can do with this amazing team of glorious losers. (Laughter) We've got Saviour Chishimba, who I mentioned before.
We've got Halla Tómasdóttir, who was the runner up in the Icelandic presidential election.
Many of you may have seen her amazing talk at TEDWomen just a few weeks ago where she spoke about the need for more women to get into politics.
We've got Maria das Neves from São Tomé and Príncipe.
We've got Hillary Clinton.
I don't know if she's available.
We've got Jill Stein.
And we covered also the election for the next Secretary-General of the United Nations.
We've got the ex-prime minister of New Zealand, who would be a wonderful member of the team.
So I think maybe those people, the glorious loser's club, could travel around the world wherever there's an election and remind people of the necessity in our modern age of thinking a little bit outwards and thinking of the international consequences.
So what comes next for the global vote?
Well, obviously, the Donald and Hillary show is a bit of a difficult one to follow, but there are some other really important elections coming up.
In fact, they seem to be multiplying.
There's something going on, I'm sure you've noticed, in the world.
And the next row of elections are all critically important.
In just a few day's time we've got the rerun of the Austrian presidential election, with the prospect of Norbert Hofer becoming what is commonly described as the first far-right head of state in Europe since the Second World War.
Next year we've got Germany, we've got France, we've got presidential elections in Iran and a dozen others.
It doesn't get less important.
It gets more and more important.
Clearly, the global vote is not a stand-alone project.
It's not just there on its own.
It has some background.
It's part of a project which I launched back in 2014, which I call the Good Country.
The idea of the Good Country is basically very simple.
It's my simple diagnosis of what's wrong with the world and how we can fix it.
What's wrong with the world I've already hinted at.
Basically, we face an enormous and growing number of gigantic, existential global challenges: climate change, human rights abuses, mass migration, terrorism, economic chaos, weapons proliferation.
All of these problems which threaten to wipe us out are by their very nature globalized problems.
No individual country has the capability of tackling them on its own.
And so very obviously we have to cooperate and we have to collaborate as nations if we're going to solve these problems.
It's so obvious, and yet we don't.
We don't do it nearly often enough.
Most of the time, countries still persist in behaving as if they were warring, selfish tribes battling against each other, much as they have done since the nation-state was invented hundreds of years ago. And this has got to change.
This is not a change in political systems or a change in ideology. This is a change in culture.
We, all of us, have to understand that thinking inwards is not the solution to the world's problems.
We have to learn how to cooperate and collaborate a great deal more and compete just a tiny bit less.
Otherwise things are going to carry on getting bad and they're going to get much worse, much sooner than we anticipate.
This change will only happen if we ordinary people tell our politicians that things have changed.
We have to tell them that the culture has changed.
We have to tell them that they've got a new mandate.
The old mandate was very simple and very single: if you're in a position of power or authority, you're responsible for your own people and your own tiny slice of territory, and that's it.
And if in order to do the best thing for your own people, you screw over everybody else on the planet, that's even better.
That's considered to be a bit macho.
Today, I think everybody in a position of power and responsibility has got a dual mandate, which says if you're in a position of power and responsibility, you're responsible for your own people and for every single man, woman, child and animal on the planet.
You're responsible for your own slice of territory and for every single square mile of the earth's surface and the atmosphere above it.
And if you don't like that responsibility, you should not be in power.
That for me is the rule of the modern age, and that's the message that we've got to get across to our politicians, and show them that that's the way things are done these days.
Otherwise, we're all screwed.
I don't have a problem, actually, with Donald Trump's credo of "America first." It seems to me that that's a pretty banal statement of what politicians have always done and probably should always do.
Of course they're elected to represent the interests of their own people.
But what I find so boring and so old-fashioned and so unimaginative about his take on that is that America first means everyone else last, that making America great again means making everybody else small again, and it's just not true.
In my job as a policy advisor over the last 20 years or so, I've seen so many hundreds of examples of policies that harmonize the international and the domestic needs, and they make better policy.
I'm not asking nations to be altruistic or self-sacrificing. That would be ridiculous.
No nation would ever do that.
I'm asking them to wake up and understand that we need a new form of governance, which is possible and which harmonizes those two needs, those good for our own people and those good for everybody else.
Since the US election and since Brexit it's become more and more obvious to me that those old distinctions of left wing and right wing no longer make sense.
They really don't fit the pattern.
What does seem to matter today is very simple, whether your view of the world is that you take comfort from looking inwards and backwards, or whether, like me, you find hope in looking forwards and outwards.
That's the new politics.
That's the new division that is splitting the world right down the middle.
Now, that may sound judgmental, but it's not meant to be.
I don't at all misunderstand why so many people find their comfort in looking inwards and backwards.
When times are difficult, when you're short of money, when you're feeling insecure and vulnerable, it's almost a natural human tendency to turn inwards, to think of your own needs and to discard everybody else's, and perhaps to start to imagine that the past was somehow better than the present or the future could ever be.
But I happen to believe that that's a dead end.
History shows us that it's a dead end.
When people turn inwards and turn backwards, human progress becomes reversed and things get worse for everybody very quickly indeed.
If you're like me and you believe in forwards and outwards, and you believe that the best thing about humanity is its diversity, and the best thing about globalization is the way that it stirs up that diversity, that cultural mixture to make something more creative, more exciting, more productive than there's ever been before in human history, then, my friends, we've got a job on our hands, because the inwards and backwards brigade are uniting as never before, and that creed of inwards and backwards, that fear, that anxiety, playing on the simplest instincts, is sweeping across the world.
Those of us who believe, as I believe, in forwards and outwards, we have to get ourselves organized, because time is running out very, very quickly.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Welcome to this next edition of TED Dialogues.
We're trying to do some bridging here today.
You know, the American dream has inspired millions of people around the world for many years.
Today, I think, you can say that America is divided, perhaps more than ever, and the divisions seem to be getting worse.
It's actually really hard for people on different sides to even have a conversation.
People almost feel... disgusted with each other.
Some families can't even speak to each other right now.
Our purpose in this dialogue today is to try to do something about that, to try to have a different kind of conversation, to do some listening, some thinking, some understanding.
And I have two people with us to help us do that.
They're not going to come at this hammer and tong against each other. This is not like cable news.
This is two people who have both spent a lot of their working life in the political center or right of the center.
They've immersed themselves in conservative worldviews, if you like.
They know that space very well.
And we're going to explore together how to think about what is happening right now, and whether we can find new ways to bridge and just to have wiser, more connected conversations.
With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson, who has spent a decade working at Fox News, hosting "Fox and Friends" and then "The Real Story," before taking a courageous stance in filing sexual harassment claims against Roger Ailes, which eventually led to his departure from Fox News.
David Brooks, who has earned the wrath of many of [The New York Times's] left-leaning readers because of his conservative views, and more recently, perhaps, some of the right-leaning readers because of his criticism of some aspects of Trump.
Yet, his columns are usually the top one, two or three most-read content of the day because they're brilliant, because they bring psychology and social science to providing understanding for what's going on.
So without further ado, a huge welcome to Gretchen and David. Come and join me.
So, Gretchen. Sixty-three million Americans voted for Donald Trump.
Why did they do this?
Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.
I mean, I think it was a movement of sorts, but it started long ago.
It didn't just happen overnight. "Anger" would be the first word that I would think of -- anger with nothing being done in Washington, anger about not being heard.
I think there was a huge swath of the population that feels like Washington never listens to them, you know, a good part of the middle of America, not just the coasts, and he was somebody they felt was listening to their concerns.
So I think those two issues would be the main reason.
I have to throw in there also celebrity.
I think that had a huge impact on Donald Trump becoming president.
CA: Was the anger justified?
David Brooks: Yeah, I think so.
In 2015 and early 2016, I wrote about 30 columns with the following theme: don't worry, Donald Trump will never be the Republican nominee.
(Laughter)
And having done that and gotten that so wrong, I decided to spend the ensuing year just out in Trumpworld, and I found a lot of economic dislocation.
I ran into a woman in West Virginia who was going to a funeral for her mom. She said, "The nice thing about being Catholic is we don't have to speak, and that's good, because we're not word people." That phrase rung in my head: word people.
A lot of us in the TED community are word people, but if you're not, the economy has not been angled toward you, and so 11 million men, for example, are out of the labor force because those jobs are done away.
A lot of social injury.
You used to be able to say, "I'm not the richest person in the world, I'm not the most famous, but my neighbors can count on me and I get some dignity out of that." And because of celebritification or whatever, if you're not rich or famous, you feel invisible.
And a lot of moral injury, sense of feeling betrayed, and frankly, in this country, we almost have one success story, which is you go to college, get a white-collar job, and you're a success, and if you don't fit in that formula, you feel like you're not respected.
And so that accumulation of things -- and when I talked to Trump voters and still do, I found most of them completely realistic about his failings, but they said, this is my shot.
GC: And yet I predicted that he would be the nominee, because I've known him for 27 years.
He's a master marketer, and one of the things he did extremely well that President Obama also did extremely well, was simplifying the message, simplifying down to phrases and to a populist message.
Even if he can't achieve it, it sounded good.
And many people latched on to that simplicity again.
It's something they could grasp onto: "I get that. I want that. That sounds fantastic." And I remember when he used to come on my show originally, before "The Apprentice" was even "The Apprentice," and he'd say it was the number one show on TV.
I'd say back to him, "No, it's not." And he would say, "Yes it is, Gretchen." And I would say, "No it's not." But people at home would see that, and they'd be like, "Wow, I should be watching the number one show on TV." And -- lo and behold -- it became the number one show on TV.
So he had this, I've seen this ability in him to be the master marketer.
CA: It's puzzling to a lot of people on the left that so many women voted for him, despite some of his comments.
GC: I wrote a column about this for Time Motto, saying that I really believe that lot of people put on blinders, and maybe for the first time, some people decided that policies they believed in and being heard and not being invisible anymore was more important to them than the way in which he had acted or acts as a human.
And so human dignity -- whether it would be the dust-up about the disabled reporter, or what happened in that audiotape with Billy Bush and the way in which he spoke about women -- they put that aside and pretended as if they hadn't seen that or heard that, because to them, policies were more important.
CA: Right, so just because someone voted for Trump, it's not blind adherence to everything that he's said or stood for.
GC: No. I heard a lot of people that would say to me, "Wow, I just wish he would shut up before the election.
If he would just stay quiet, he'd get elected."
CA: And so, maybe for people on the left there's a trap there, to sort of despise or just be baffled by the support, assuming that it's for some of the unattractive features.
Actually, maybe they're supporting him despite those, because they see something exciting. They see a man of action.
They see the choking hold of government being thrown off in some way and they're excited by that.
GC: But don't forget we saw that on the left as well -- Bernie Sanders.
So this is one of the commonalities that I think we can talk about today, "The Year of the Outsider," David -- right?
And even though Bernie Sanders has been in Congress for a long time, he was deemed an outsider this time. And so there was anger on the left as well, and so many people were in favor of Bernie Sanders.
So I see it as a commonality.
People who like Trump, people who like Bernie Sanders, they were liking different policies, but the underpinning was anger.
CA: David, there's often this narrative, then, that the sole explanation for Trump's victory and his rise is his tapping into anger in a very visceral way.
But you've written a bit about that it's actually more than that, that there's a worldview that's being worked on here.
Could you talk about that?
DB: I would say he understood what, frankly, I didn't, which is what debate we were having.
And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan, and it was the big government versus small government debate.
It was Barry Goldwater versus George McGovern, and that was the debate we had been having for a generation. It was: Democrats wanted to use government to enhance equality, Republicans wanted to limit government to enhance freedom.
That was the debate.
He understood what I think the two major parties did not, which was that's not the debate anymore.
The debate is now open versus closed.
On one side are those who have the tailwinds of globalization and the meritocracy blowing at their back, and they tend to favor open trade, open borders, open social mores, because there are so many opportunities.
On the other side are those who feel the headwinds of globalization and the meritocracy just blasting in their faces, and they favor closed trade, closed borders, closed social mores, because they just want some security.
And so he was right on that fundamental issue, and people were willing to overlook a lot to get there.
And so he felt that sense of security.
We're speaking the morning after Trump's joint session speech.
There are three traditional groups in the Republican Party.
There are the foreign policies hawks who believe in America as global policeman.
Trump totally repudiated that view.
Second, there was the social conservatives who believed in religious liberty, pro-life, prayer in schools.
He totally ignored that.
There was not a single mention of a single social conservative issue.
And then there were the fiscal hawks, the people who wanted to cut down on the national debt, Tea Party, cut the size of government.
He's expanding the size of government!
Here's a man who has single-handedly revolutionized a major American party because he understood where the debate was headed before other people.
And then guys like Steve Bannon come in and give him substance to his impulses.
CA: And so take that a bit further, and maybe expand a bit more on your insights into Steve Bannon's worldview.
Because he's sometimes tarred in very simple terms as this dangerous, racist, xenophobic, anger-sparking person.
There's more to the story; that is perhaps an unfair simplification.
DB: I think that part is true, but there's another part that's probably true, too.
He's part of a global movement.
It's like being around Marxists in 1917.
There's him here, there's the UKIP party, there's the National Front in France, there's Putin, there's a Turkish version, a Philippine version.
So we have to recognize that this is a global intellectual movement. And it believes that wisdom and virtue is not held in individual conversation and civility the way a lot of us in the enlightenment side of the world do.
It's held in -- the German word is the "volk" -- in the people, in the common, instinctive wisdom of the plain people.
And the essential virtue of that people is always being threatened by outsiders.
And he's got a strategy for how to get there.
He's got a series of policies to bring the people up and repudiate the outsiders, whether those outsiders are Islam, Mexicans, the media, the coastal elites... And there's a whole worldview there; it's a very coherent worldview.
I sort of have more respect for him.
I loathe what he stands for and I think he's wrong on the substance, but it's interesting to see someone with a set of ideas find a vehicle, Donald Trump, and then try to take control of the White House in order to advance his viewpoint.
CA: So it's almost become, like, that the core question of our time now is: Can you be patriotic but also have a global mindset?
Are these two things implacably opposed to each other?
I mean, a lot of conservatives and, to the extent that it's a different category, a lot of Trump supporters, are infuriated by the coastal elites and the globalists because they see them as, sort of, not cheering for America, not embracing fully American values.
I mean, have you seen that in your conversations with people, in your understanding of their mindset?
GC: I do think that there's a huge difference between -- I hate to put people in categories, but, Middle America versus people who live on the coasts.
It's an entirely different existence.
And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have an understanding of Middle America, and I've never forgotten it.
And maybe that's why I have an understanding of what happened here, because those people often feel like nobody's listening to them, and that we're only concentrating on California and New York.
And so I think that was a huge reason why Trump was elected.
I mean, these people felt like they were being heard.
Whether or not patriotism falls into that, I'm not sure about that.
I do know one thing: a lot of things Trump talked about last night are not conservative things.
Had Hillary Clinton gotten up and given that speech, not one Republican would have stood up to applaud.
I mean, he's talking about spending a trillion dollars on infrastructure.
That is not a conservative viewpoint.
He talked about government-mandated maternity leave.
A lot of women may love that; it's not a conservative viewpoint. So it's fascinating that people who loved what his message was during the campaign, I'm not sure -- how do you think they'll react to that?
DB: I should say I grew up in Lower Manhattan, in the triangle between ABC Carpets, the Strand Bookstore and The Odeon restaurant.
(Laughter)
CA: You are a card-carrying member of the coastal elite, my man.
But what did you make of the speech last night?
It seemed to be a move to a more moderate position, on the face of it.
DB: Yeah, I thought it was his best speech, and it took away the freakishness of him.
I do think he's a moral freak, and I think he'll be undone by that fact, the fact that he just doesn't know anything about anything and is uncurious about it.
But if you take away these minor flaws, I think we got to see him at his best, and it was revealing for me to see him at his best, because to me, it exposed a central contradiction that he's got to confront, that a lot of what he's doing is offering security. So, "I'm ordering closed borders, I'm going to secure the world for you, for my people." But then if you actually look at a lot of his economic policies, like health care reform, which is about private health care accounts, that's not security, that's risk.
Educational vouchers: that's risk. Deregulation: that's risk.
There's really a contradiction between the security of the mindset and a lot of the policies, which are very risk-oriented.
And what I would say, especially having spent this year, the people in rural Minnesota, in New Mexico -- they've got enough risk in their lives.
And so they're going to say, "No thank you." And I think his health care repeal will fail for that reason.
CA: But despite the criticisms you just made of him, it does at least seem that he's listening to a surprisingly wide range of voices; it's not like everyone is coming from the same place.
And maybe that leads to a certain amount of chaos and confusion, but --
GC: I actually don't think he's listening to a wide range of voices.
I think he's listening to very few people.
That's just my impression of it.
I believe that some of the things he said last night had Ivanka all over them.
So I believe he was listening to her before that speech.
And he was Teleprompter Trump last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.
And that's why, before we came out here, I said, "We better check Twitter to see if anything's changed." And also I think you have to keep in mind that because he's such a unique character, what was the bar that we were expecting last night?
Was it here or here or here?
And so he comes out and gives a looking political speech, and everyone goes, "Wow! He can do it." It just depends on which direction he goes.
DB: Yeah, and we're trying to build bridges here, and especially for an audience that may have contempt for Trump, it's important to say, no, this is a real thing.
But as I try my best to go an hour showing respect for him, my thyroid is surging, because I think the oddities of his character really are condemnatory and are going to doom him.
CA: Your reputation is as a conservative.
People would you describe you as right of center, and yet here you are with this visceral reaction against him and some of what he stands for.
I mean, I'm -- how do you have a conversation?
The people who support him, on evidence so far, are probably pretty excited.
He's certainly shown real engagement in a lot of what he promised to do, and there is a strong desire to change the system radically.
People hate what government has become and how it's left them out.
GC: I totally agree with that, but I think that when he was proposing a huge government program last night that we used to call the bad s-word, "stimulus," I find it completely ironic.
To spend a trillion dollars on something -- that is not a conservative viewpoint.
Then again, I don't really believe he's a Republican.
DB: And I would say, as someone who identifies as conservative: first of all, to be conservative is to believe in the limitations of politics.
Samuel Johnson said, "Of all the things that human hearts endure, how few are those that kings can cause and cure." Politics is a limited realm; what matters most is the moral nature of the society.
And so I have to think character comes first, and a man who doesn't pass the character threshold cannot be a good president.
Second, I'm the kind of conservative who -- I harken back to Alexander Hamilton, who was a Latino hip-hop star from the heights --
(Laughter)
but his definition of America was very future-oriented.
He was a poor boy from the islands who had this rapid and amazing rise to success, and he wanted government to give poor boys and girls like him a chance to succeed, using limited but energetic government to create social mobility.
For him and for Lincoln and for Teddy Roosevelt, the idea of America was the idea of the future.
We may have division and racism and slavery in our past, but we have a common future.
The definition of America that Steve Bannon stands for is backwards-looking. It's nostalgic; it's for the past.
And that is not traditionally the American identity.
That's traditionally, frankly, the Russian identity. That's how they define virtue.
And so I think it is a fundamental and foundational betrayal of what conservatism used to stand for.
CA: Well, I'd like actually like to hear from you, and if we see some comments coming in from some of you, we'll -- oh, well here's one right now.
Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried to convince progressive friends that they need to understand what motivates Trump supporters, yet many of them have given up trying to understand in the face of what they perceive as lies, selfishness and hatred. How would you reach out to such people, the Tea Party of the left, to try to bridge this divide?
GC: I actually think there are commonalities in anger, as I expressed earlier.
So I think you can come to the table, both being passionate about something.
So at least you care.
And I would like to believe -- the c-word has also become a horrible word -- "compromise," right?
So you have the far left and the far right, and compromise -- forget it.
Those groups don't want to even think about it.
But you have a huge swath of voters, myself included, who are registered independents, like 40 percent of us, right?
So there is a huge faction of America that wants to see change and wants to see people come together. It's just that we have to figure out how to do that.
CA: So let's talk about that for a minute, because we're having these TED Dialogues, we're trying to bridge.
There's a lot of people out there, right now, perhaps especially on the left, who think this is a terrible idea, that actually, the only moral response to the great tyranny that may be about to emerge in America is to resist it at every stage, is to fight it tooth and nail, it's a mistake to try and do this. Just fight! Is there a case for that?
DB: It depends what "fight" means.
If it means literal fighting, then no.
If it means marching, well maybe marching to raise consciousness, that seems fine.
But if you want change in this country, we do it through parties and politics.
We organize parties, and those parties are big, diverse, messy coalitions, and we engage in politics, and politics is always morally unsatisfying because it's always a bunch of compromises. But politics is essentially a competition between partial truths. The Trump people have a piece of the truth in America.
I think Trump himself is the wrong answer to the right question, but they have some truth, and it's truth found in the epidemic of opiates around the country, it's truth found in the spread of loneliness, it's the truth found in people whose lives are inverted.
They peaked professionally at age 30, and it's all been downhill since.
And so, understanding that doesn't take fighting, it takes conversation and then asking, "What are we going to replace Trump with?"
GC: But you saw fighting last night, even at the speech, because you saw the Democratic women who came and wore white to honor the suffragette movement.
I remember back during the campaign where some Trump supporters wanted to actually get rid of the amendment that allowed us to vote as women.
It was like, what?
So I don't know if that's the right way to fight.
It was interesting, because I was looking in the audience, trying to see Democratic women who didn't wear white.
So there's a lot going on there, and there's a lot of ways to fight that are not necessarily doing that.
CA: I mean, one of the key questions, to me, is: The people who voted for Trump but, if you like, are more in the center, like they're possibly amenable to persuasion -- are they more likely to be persuaded by seeing a passionate uprising of people saying, "No, no, no, you can't!" or will that actually piss them off and push them away?
DB: How are any of us persuaded?
Am I going to persuade you by saying, "Well, you're kind of a bigot, you're supporting bigotry, you're supporting sexism.
You're a primitive, fascistic rise from some authoritarian past"?
That's probably not going to be too persuasive to you.
And so the way any of us are persuaded is by: a) some basic show of respect for the point of view, and saying, "I think this guy is not going to get you where you need to go." And there are two phrases you've heard over and over again, wherever you go in the country.
One, the phrase "flyover country." And that's been heard for years, but I would say this year, I heard it almost on an hourly basis, a sense of feeling invisible.
And then the sense a sense of the phrase "political correctness." Just that rebellion: "They're not even letting us say what we think." And I teach at Yale.
The narrowing of debate is real.
CA: So you would say this is a trap that liberals have fallen into by celebrating causes they really believe in, often expressed through the language of "political correctness." They have done damage.
They have pushed people away.
DB: I would say a lot of the argument, though, with "descent to fascism," "authoritarianism" -- that just feels over-the-top to people.
And listen, I've written eight million anti-Trump columns, but it is a problem, especially for the coastal media, that every time he does something slightly wrong, we go to 11, and we're at 11 every day. And it just strains credibility at some point.
CA: Crying wolf a little too loud and a little too early.
But there may be a time when we really do have to cry wolf.
GC: But see -- one of the most important things to me is how the conservative media handles Trump.
Will they call him out when things are not true, or will they just go along with it?
To me, that is what is essential in this entire discussion, because when you have followers of somebody who don't really care if he tells the truth or not, that can be very dangerous.
So to me, it's: How is the conservative media going to respond to it?
I mean, you've been calling them out.
But how will other forms of conservative media deal with that as we move forward?
DB: It's all shifted, though.
The conservative media used to be Fox or Charles Krauthammer or George Will.
They're no longer the conservative media.
Now there's another whole set of institutions further right, which is Breitbart and Infowars, Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham, and so they're the ones who are now his base, not even so much Fox.
CA: My last question for the time being is just on this question of the truth. I mean, it's one of the scariest things to people right now, that there is no agreement, nationally, on what is true.
I've never seen anything like it, where facts are so massively disputed.
Your whole newspaper, sir, is delivering fake news every day.
DB: And failing.
(Laughter)
CA: And failing. My commiserations. But is there any path whereby we can start to get some kind of consensus, to believe the same things?
Can online communities play a role here? How do we fix this?
GC: See, I understand how that happened.
That's another groundswell kind of emotion that was going on in the middle of America and not being heard, in thinking that the mainstream media was biased.
There's a difference, though, between being biased and being fake.
To me, that is a very important distinction in this conversation.
So let's just say that there was some bias in the mainstream media. OK. So there are ways to try and mend that.
But what Trump's doing is nuclearizing that and saying, "Look, we're just going to call all of that fake." That's where it gets dangerous.
CA: Do you think enough of his supporters have a greater loyalty to the truth than to any ... Like, the principle of not supporting something that is demonstrably not true actually matters, so there will be a correction at some point?
DB: I think the truth eventually comes out.
So for example, Donald Trump has based a lot of his economic policy on this supposition that Americans have lost manufacturing jobs because they've been stolen by the Chinese.
That is maybe 13 percent of the jobs that left.
The truth is that 87 percent of the jobs were replaced by technology.
That is just the truth.
And so as a result, when he says, "I'm going to close TPP and all the jobs will come roaring back," they will not come roaring back.
So that is an actual fact, in my belief. And —
GC: But I'm saying what his supporters think is the truth, no matter how many times you might say that, they still believe him.
DB: But eventually either jobs will come back or they will not come back, and at that point, either something will work or it doesn't work, and it doesn't work or not work because of great marketing, it works because it actually addresses a real problem and so I happen to think the truth will out.
CA: If you've got a question, please raise your hand here.
Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.
My name's Yael Eisenstat.
I hear a lot of this talk about how we all need to start talking to each other more and understanding each other more, and I've even written about this, published on this subject as well, but now today I keep hearing liberals -- yes, I live in New York, I can be considered a liberal -- we sit here and self-analyze: What did we do to not understand the Rust Belt?
Or: What can we do to understand Middle America better?
And what I'd like to know: Have you seen any attempts or conversations from Middle America of what can I do to understand the so-called coastal elites better?
Because I'm just offended as being put in a box as a coastal elite as someone in Middle America is as being considered a flyover state and not listened to.
CA: There you go, I can hear Facebook cheering as you --
DB: I would say -- and this is someone who has been conservative all my adult life -- when you grow up conservative, you learn to speak both languages.
Because if I'm going to listen to music, I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.
So a lot of my favorite rock bands are all on the left.
If I'm going to go to a school, I'm going probably to school where the culture is liberal.
If I'm going to watch a sitcom or a late-night comedy show, it's going to be liberal.
If I'm going to read a good newspaper, it'll be the New York Times.
As a result, you learn to speak both languages.
And that actually, at least for a number of years, when I started at National Review with William F. Buckley, it made us sharper, because we were used to arguing against people every day.
The problem now that's happened is you have ghettoization on the right and you can live entirely in rightworld, so as a result, the quality of argument on the right has diminished, because you're not in the other side all the time.
But I do think if you're living in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona, the coastal elites make themselves aware to you, so you know that language as well, but it's not the reverse.
CA: But what does Middle America not get about coastal elites?
So the critique is, you are not dealing with the real problems.
There's a feeling of a snobbishness, an elitism that is very off-putting.
What are they missing?
If you could plant one piece of truth from the mindset of someone in this room, for example, what would you say to them?
DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are.
No, I reject the category.
The problem with populism is the same problem with elitism.
It's just a prejudice on the basis of probably an over-generalized social class distinction which is too simplistic to apply in reality.
Those of us in New York know there are some people in New York who are completely awesome, and some people who are pathetic, and if you live in Iowa, some people are awesome and some people are pathetic.
It's not a question of what degree you have or where you happen to live in the country.
The distinction is just a crude simplification to arouse political power.
GC: But I would encourage people to watch a television news show or read a column that they normally wouldn't.
So if you are a Trump supporter, watch the other side for a day, because you need to come out of the bubble if you're ever going to have a conversation.
And both sides -- so if you're a liberal, then watch something that's very conservative.
Read a column that is not something you would normally read, because then you gain perspective of what the other side is thinking, and to me, that's a start of coming together.
I worry about the same thing you worry about, these bubbles.
I think if you only watch certain entities, you have no idea what the rest of the world is talking about.
DB: I think not only watching, being part of an organization that meets at least once a month that puts you in direct contact with people completely unlike yourself is something we all have a responsibility for.
I may get this a little wrong, but I think of the top-selling automotive models in this country, I think the top three or four are all pickup trucks.
So ask yourself: How many people do I know who own a pickup truck?
And it could be very few or zero for a lot of people.
And that's sort of a warning sign kind of a problem.
Where can I join a club where I'll have a lot in common with a person who drives a pickup truck because we have a common interest in whatever?
CA: And so the internet is definitely contributing to this.
A question here from Chris Ajemian: "How do you feel structure of communications, especially the prevalence of social media and individualized content, can be used to bring together a political divide, instead of just filing communities into echo chambers?" I mean, it looks like Facebook and Google, since the election, are working hard on this question. They're trying to change the algorithms so that they don't amplify fake news to the extent that it happened last time round.
Do you see any other promising signs of ...?
GC: ... or amplify one side of the equation.
CA: Exactly.
GC: I think that was the constant argument from the right, that social media and the internet in general was putting articles towards the top that were not their worldview.
I think, again, that fed into the anger. It fed into the anger of: "You're pushing something that's not what I believe." But social media has obviously changed everything, and I think Trump is the example of Twitter changing absolutely everything.
And from his point of view, he's reaching the American people without a filter, which he believes the media is.
CA: Question from the audience.
Destiny: Hi. I'm Destiny. I have a question regarding political correctness, and I'm curious: When did political correctness become synonymous with silencing, versus a way that we speak about other people to show them respect and preserve their dignity?
GC: Well, I think the conservative media really pounded this issue for the last 10 years.
I think that they really, really spent a lot of time talking about political correctness, and how people should have the ability to say what they think.
Another reason why Trump became so popular: because he says what he thinks.
It also makes me think about the fact that I do believe there are a lot of people in America who agree with Steve Bannon, but they would never say it publicly, and so voting for Trump gave them the opportunity to agree with it silently.
DB: On the issue of immigration, it's a legitimate point of view that we have too many immigrants in the country, that it's economically costly.
CA: That we have too many --
DB: Immigrants in the country, especially from Britain.
(Laughter)
GC: I kind of like the British accent, OK?
CA: I apologize. America, I am sorry.
(Laughter)
I'll go now.
DB: But it became sort of impermissible to say that, because it was a sign that somehow you must be a bigot of some sort.
So the political correctness was not only cracking down on speech that we would all find completely offensive, it was cracking down on some speech that was legitimate, and then it was turning speech and thought into action and treating it as a crime, and people getting fired and people thrown out of schools, and there were speech codes written.
Now there are these diversity teams, where if you say something that somebody finds offensive, like, "Smoking is really dangerous," you can say "You're insulting my group," and the team from the administration will come down into your dorm room and put thought police upon you.
And so there has been a genuine narrowing of what is permissible to say.
And some of it is legitimate.
There are certain words that there should be some social sanction against, but some of it was used to enforce a political agenda.
CA: So is that a project you would urge on liberals, if you like -- progressives -- to rethink the ground rules around political correctness and accept a little more uncomfortable language in certain circumstances?
Can you see that being solved to an extent that others won't be so offended?
DB: I mean, most American universities, especially elite universities, are overwhelmingly on the left, and there's just an ease of temptation to use your overwhelming cultural power to try to enforce some sort of thought that you think is right and correct thought.
So, be a little more self-suspicious of, are we doing that?
And second, my university, the University of Chicago, sent out this letter saying, we will have no safe spaces.
There will be no critique of micro-aggression.
If you get your feelings hurt, well, welcome to the world of education.
I do think that policy -- which is being embraced by a lot of people on the left, by the way -- is just a corrective to what's happened.
CA: So here's a question from Karen Holloway: How do we foster an American culture that's forward-looking, like Hamilton, that expects and deals with change, rather than wanting to have everything go back to some fictional past?
That's an easy question, right?
GC: Well, I'm still a believer in the American dream, and I think what we can teach our children is the basics, which is that hard work and believing in yourself in America, you can achieve whatever you want.
I was told that every single day.
When I got in the real world, I was like, wow, that's maybe not always so true.
But I still believe in that.
Maybe I'm being too optimistic.
So I still look towards the future for that to continue.
DB: I think you're being too optimistic.
GC: You do?
DB: The odds of an American young person exceeding their parents' salary -- a generation ago, like 86 percent did it.
Now 51 percent do it.
There's just been a problem in social mobility in the country.
CA: You've written that this entire century has basically been a disaster, that the age of sunny growth is over and we're in deep trouble.
DB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged, in real terms, population-adjusted, two or three percent growth for 50 years, and now we've had less than one percent growth.
And so there's something seeping out.
And so if I'm going to tell people that they should take risks, one of the things we're seeing is a rapid decline in mobility, the number of people who are moving across state lines, and that's especially true among millennials.
It's young people that are moving less.
So how do we give people the security from which they can take risk?
And I'm a big believer in attachment theory of raising children, and attachment theory is based on the motto that all of life is a series of daring adventures from a secure base.
Have you parents given you a secure base?
And as a society, we do not have a secure base, and we won't get to that "Hamilton," risk-taking, energetic ethos until we can supply a secure base.
CA: So I wonder whether there's ground here to create almost like a shared agenda, a bridging conversation, on the one hand recognizing that there is this really deep problem that the system, the economic system that we built, seems to be misfiring right now.
Second, that maybe, if you're right that it's not all about immigrants, it's probably more about technology, if you could win that argument, that de-emphasizes what seems to me the single most divisive territory between Trump supporters and others, which is around the role of the other.
It's very offensive to people on the left to have the other demonized to the extent that the other seems to be demonized.
That feels deeply immoral, and maybe people on the left could agree, as you said, that immigration may have happened too fast, and there is a limit beyond which human societies struggle, but nonetheless this whole problem becomes de-emphasized if automation is the key issue, and then we try to work together on recognizing that it's real, recognizing that the problem probably wasn't properly addressed or seen or heard, and try to figure out how to rebuild communities using, well, using what?
That seems to me to become the fertile conversation of the future: How do we rebuild communities in this modern age, with technology doing what it's doing, and reimagine this bright future?
GC: That's why I go back to optimism.
I'm not being ... it's not like I'm not looking at the facts, where we've come or where we've come from.
But for gosh sakes, if we don't look at it from an optimistic point of view -- I'm refusing to do that just yet.
I'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old to say, "Look, the world is dim."
CA; We're going to have one more question from the room here.
Questioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry. You both mentioned the infrastructure plan and Russia and some other things that wouldn't be traditional Republican priorities.
What do you think, or when, will Republicans be motivated to take a stand against Trumpism?
GC: After last night, not for a while.
He changed a lot last night, I believe.
DB: His popularity among Republicans -- he's got 85 percent approval, which is higher than Reagan had at this time, and that's because society has just gotten more polarized.
So people follow the party much more than they used to.
So if you're waiting for Paul Ryan and the Republicans in Congress to flake away, it's going to take a little while.
GC: But also because they're all concerned about reelection, and Trump has so much power with getting people either for you or against you, and so, they're vacillating every day, probably: "Well, should I go against or should I not?" But last night, where he finally sounded presidential, I think most Republicans are breathing a sigh of relief today.
DB: The half-life of that is short.
GC: Right -- I was just going to say, until Twitter happens again.
CA: OK, I want to give each of you the chance to imagine you're speaking to -- I don't know -- the people online who are watching this, who may be Trump supporters, who may be on the left, somewhere in the middle.
How would you advise them to bridge or to relate to other people?
Can you share any final wisdom on this?
Or if you think that they shouldn't, tell them that as well.
GC: I would just start by saying that I really think any change and coming together starts from the top, just like any other organization.
And I would love if, somehow, Trump supporters or people on the left could encourage their leaders to show that compassion from the top, because imagine the change that we could have if Donald Trump tweeted out today, to all of his supporters, "Let's not be vile anymore to each other. Let's have more understanding. As a leader, I'm going to be more inclusive to all of the people of America." To me, it starts at the top.
Is he going to do that?
I have no idea.
But I think that everything starts from the top, and the power that he has in encouraging his supporters to have an understanding of where people are coming from on the other side.
CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say I don't think we can teach each other to be civil, and give us sermons on civility. That's not going to do it.
It's substance and how we act, and the nice thing about Donald Trump is he smashed our categories.
All the categories that we thought we were thinking in, they're obsolete.
They were great for the 20th century. They're not good for today.
He's got an agenda which is about closing borders and closing trade.
I just don't think it's going to work.
I think if we want to rebuild communities, recreate jobs, we need a different set of agenda that smashes through all our current divisions and our current categories.
For me, that agenda is Reaganism on macroeconomic policy, Sweden on welfare policy and cuts across right and left.
I think we have to have a dynamic economy that creates growth.
That's the Reagan on economic policy.
But people have to have that secure base.
There have to be nurse-family partnerships; there has to be universal preschool; there have to be charter schools; there have to be college programs with wraparound programs for parents and communities.
We need to help heal the crisis of social solidarity in this country and help heal families, and government just has to get a lot more involved in the way liberals like to rebuild communities.
At the other hand, we have to have an economy that's free and open the way conservatives used to like.
And so getting the substance right is how you smash through the partisan identities, because the substance is what ultimately shapes our polarization.
CA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much for an absolutely fascinating conversation. Thank you. That was really, really interesting.
(Applause)
Hey, let's keep the conversation going. We're continuing to try and figure out whether we can add something here, so keep the conversation going on Facebook.
Give us your thoughts from whatever part of the political spectrum you're on, and actually, wherever in the world you are. This is not just about America. It's about the world, too.
But we're not going to end today without music, because if we put music in every political conversation, the world would be completely different, frankly. It just would.
(Applause)
Up in Harlem, this extraordinary woman, Vy Higginsen, who's actually right here -- let's get a shot of her.
She created this program that brings teens together, teaches them the joy and the impact of gospel music, and hundreds of teens have gone through this program.
It's transformative for them.
The music they made, as you already heard, is extraordinary, and I can't think of a better way of ending this TED Dialogue than welcoming Vy Higginsen's Gospel Choir from Harlem. Thank you.
(Singing) Choir: O beautiful for spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountain majesties Above the fruited plain America! America! America! America! God shed his grace on thee And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea From sea to shining sea
(Applause)
I'm going to be talking about statistics today.
If that makes you immediately feel a little bit wary, that's OK, that doesn't make you some kind of crazy conspiracy theorist, it makes you skeptical.
And when it comes to numbers, especially now, you should be skeptical.
But you should also be able to tell which numbers are reliable and which ones aren't.
So today I want to try to give you some tools to be able to do that.
But before I do, I just want to clarify which numbers I'm talking about here.
I'm not talking about claims like, "9 out of 10 women recommend this anti-aging cream." I think a lot of us always roll our eyes at numbers like that.
What's different now is people are questioning statistics like, "The US unemployment rate is five percent." What makes this claim different is it doesn't come from a private company, it comes from the government.
About 4 out of 10 Americans distrust the economic data that gets reported by government.
Among supporters of President Trump it's even higher; it's about 7 out of 10.
I don't need to tell anyone here that there are a lot of dividing lines in our society right now, and a lot of them start to make sense, once you understand people's relationships with these government numbers.
On the one hand, there are those who say these statistics are crucial, that we need them to make sense of society as a whole in order to move beyond emotional anecdotes and measure progress in an [objective] way.
And then there are the others, who say that these statistics are elitist, maybe even rigged; they don't make sense and they don't really reflect what's happening in people's everyday lives.
It kind of feels like that second group is winning the argument right now.
We're living in a world of alternative facts, where people don't find statistics this kind of common ground, this starting point for debate.
This is a problem.
There are actually moves in the US right now to get rid of some government statistics altogether.
Right now there's a bill in congress about measuring racial inequality.
The draft law says that government money should not be used to collect data on racial segregation.
This is a total disaster.
If we don't have this data, how can we observe discrimination, let alone fix it?
In other words: How can a government create fair policies if they can't measure current levels of unfairness?
This isn't just about discrimination, it's everything — think about it.
How can we legislate on health care if we don't have good data on health or poverty?
How can we have public debate about immigration if we can't at least agree on how many people are entering and leaving the country?
Statistics come from the state; that's where they got their name.
The point was to better measure the population in order to better serve it.
So we need these government numbers, but we also have to move beyond either blindly accepting or blindly rejecting them.
We need to learn the skills to be able to spot bad statistics.
I started to learn some of these when I was working in a statistical department that's part of the United Nations.
Our job was to find out how many Iraqis had been forced from their homes as a result of the war, and what they needed.
It was really important work, but it was also incredibly difficult.
Every single day, we were making decisions that affected the accuracy of our numbers -- decisions like which parts of the country we should go to, who we should speak to, which questions we should ask.
And I started to feel really disillusioned with our work, because we thought we were doing a really good job, but the one group of people who could really tell us were the Iraqis, and they rarely got the chance to find our analysis, let alone question it.
So I started to feel really determined that the one way to make numbers more accurate is to have as many people as possible be able to question them.
So I became a data journalist. My job is finding these data sets and sharing them with the public.
Anyone can do this, you don't have to be a geek or a nerd.
You can ignore those words; they're used by people trying to say they're smart while pretending they're humble.
Absolutely anyone can do this.
I want to give you guys three questions that will help you be able to spot some bad statistics.
So, question number one is: Can you see uncertainty?
One of things that's really changed people's relationship with numbers, and even their trust in the media, has been the use of political polls.
I personally have a lot of issues with political polls because I think the role of journalists is actually to report the facts and not attempt to predict them, especially when those predictions can actually damage democracy by signaling to people: don't bother to vote for that guy, he doesn't have a chance.
Let's set that aside for now and talk about the accuracy of this endeavor.
Based on national elections in the UK, Italy, Israel and of course, the most recent US presidential election, using polls to predict electoral outcomes is about as accurate as using the moon to predict hospital admissions.
No, seriously, I used actual data from an academic study to draw this.
There are a lot of reasons why polling has become so inaccurate.
Our societies have become really diverse, which makes it difficult for pollsters to get a really nice representative sample of the population for their polls.
People are really reluctant to answer their phones to pollsters, and also, shockingly enough, people might lie.
But you wouldn't necessarily know that to look at the media.
For one thing, the probability of a Hillary Clinton win was communicated with decimal places.
We don't use decimal places to describe the temperature.
How on earth can predicting the behavior of 230 million voters in this country be that precise?
And then there were those sleek charts.
See, a lot of data visualizations will overstate certainty, and it works -- these charts can numb our brains to criticism.
When you hear a statistic, you might feel skeptical.
As soon as it's buried in a chart, it feels like some kind of objective science, and it's not.
So I was trying to find ways to better communicate this to people, to show people the uncertainty in our numbers.
What I did was I started taking real data sets, and turning them into hand-drawn visualizations, so that people can see how imprecise the data is; so people can see that a human did this, a human found the data and visualized it.
For example, instead of finding out the probability of getting the flu in any given month, you can see the rough distribution of flu season. This is --
(Laughter)
a bad shot to show in February.
But it's also more responsible data visualization, because if you were to show the exact probabilities, maybe that would encourage people to get their flu jabs at the wrong time.
The point of these shaky lines is so that people remember these imprecisions, but also so they don't necessarily walk away with a specific number, but they can remember important facts.
Facts like injustice and inequality leave a huge mark on our lives.
Facts like Black Americans and Native Americans have shorter life expectancies than those of other races, and that isn't changing anytime soon.
Facts like prisoners in the US can be kept in solitary confinement cells that are smaller than the size of an average parking space.
The point of these visualizations is also to remind people of some really important statistical concepts, concepts like averages.
So let's say you hear a claim like, "The average swimming pool in the US contains 6.23 fecal accidents." That doesn't mean every single swimming pool in the country contains exactly 6.23 turds.
So in order to show that, I went back to the original data, which comes from the CDC, who surveyed 47 swimming facilities.
And I just spent one evening redistributing poop. So you can kind of see how misleading averages can be.
(Laughter)
OK, so the second question that you guys should be asking yourselves to spot bad numbers is: Can I see myself in the data?
This question is also about averages in a way, because part of the reason why people are so frustrated with these national statistics, is they don't really tell the story of who's winning and who's losing from national policy.
It's easy to understand why people are frustrated with global averages when they don't match up with their personal experiences.
I wanted to show people the way data relates to their everyday lives.
I started this advice column called "Dear Mona," where people would write to me with questions and concerns and I'd try to answer them with data.
People asked me anything. questions like, "Is it normal to sleep in a separate bed to my wife?" "Do people regret their tattoos?" "What does it mean to die of natural causes?"
All of these questions are great, because they make you think about ways to find and communicate these numbers.
If someone asks you, "How much pee is a lot of pee?" which is a question that I got asked, you really want to make sure that the visualization makes sense to as many people as possible.
These numbers aren't unavailable.
Sometimes they're just buried in the appendix of an academic study.
And they're certainly not inscrutable; if you really wanted to test these numbers on urination volume, you could grab a bottle and try it for yourself.
(Laughter)
The point of this isn't necessarily that every single data set has to relate specifically to you.
I'm interested in how many women were issued fines in France for wearing the face veil, or the niqab, even if I don't live in France or wear the face veil.
The point of asking where you fit in is to get as much context as possible.
So it's about zooming out from one data point, like the unemployment rate is five percent, and seeing how it changes over time, or seeing how it changes by educational status -- this is why your parents always wanted you to go to college -- or seeing how it varies by gender.
Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher than the female unemployment rate.
Up until the early '80s, it was the other way around.
This is a story of one of the biggest changes that's happened in American society, and it's all there in that chart, once you look beyond the averages.
The axes are everything; once you change the scale, you can change the story.
OK, so the third and final question that I want you guys to think about when you're looking at statistics is: How was the data collected?
So far, I've only talked about the way data is communicated, but the way it's collected matters just as much.
I know this is tough, because methodologies can be opaque and actually kind of boring, but there are some simple steps you can take to check this.
I'll use one last example here.
One poll found that 41 percent of Muslims in this country support jihad, which is obviously pretty scary, and it was reported everywhere in 2015.
When I want to check a number like that, I'll start off by finding the original questionnaire.
It turns out that journalists who reported on that statistic ignored a question lower down on the survey that asked respondents how they defined "jihad." And most of them defined it as, "Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle to be more religious." Only 16 percent defined it as, "violent holy war against unbelievers." This is the really important point: based on those numbers, it's totally possible that no one in the survey who defined it as violent holy war also said they support it.
Those two groups might not overlap at all.
It's also worth asking how the survey was carried out.
This was something called an opt-in poll, which means anyone could have found it on the internet and completed it.
There's no way of knowing if those people even identified as Muslim.
And finally, there were 600 respondents in that poll.
There are roughly three million Muslims in this country, according to Pew Research Center.
That means the poll spoke to roughly one in every 5,000 Muslims in this country.
This is one of the reasons why government statistics are often better than private statistics.
A poll might speak to a couple hundred people, maybe a thousand, or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell skin care products in 2005, then you spoke to 48 women to claim that they work.
(Laughter)
Private companies don't have a huge interest in getting the numbers right, they just need the right numbers.
Government statisticians aren't like that.
In theory, at least, they're totally impartial, not least because most of them do their jobs regardless of who's in power. They're civil servants. And to do their jobs properly, they don't just speak to a couple hundred people.
Those unemployment numbers I keep on referencing come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and to make their estimates, they speak to over 140,000 businesses in this country.
I get it, it's frustrating.
If you want to test a statistic that comes from a private company, you can buy the face cream for you and a bunch of friends, test it out, if it doesn't work, you can say the numbers were wrong.
But how do you question government statistics?
You just keep checking everything. Find out how they collected the numbers. Find out if you're seeing everything on the chart you need to see.
But don't give up on the numbers altogether, because if you do, we'll be making public policy decisions in the dark, using nothing but private interests to guide us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It was just an ordinary Saturday.
My dad was outside mowing the lawn, my mom was upstairs folding laundry, my sister was in her room doing homework and I was in the basement playing video games.
And as I came upstairs to get something to drink, I looked out the window and realized that there was something that I was supposed to be doing, and this is what I saw.
No, this wasn't my family's dinner on fire.
This was my science project. Flames were pouring out, smoke was in the air and it looked like our wooden deck was about to catch fire.
I immediately started yelling.
My mom was freaking out, my dad ran around to put out the fire and of course my sister started recording a Snapchat video. (Laughter) This was just the beginning of my team's science project.
My team is composed of me and three other students who are here in the audience today.
We competed in FIRST LEGO League which is an international LEGO robotics competition for kids, and in addition to a robotics game, we also worked on a separate science project, and this was the project that we were working on.
So the idea for this project all started when a few months earlier, a couple of my teammates took a trip to Central America and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam, or expanded polystyrene foam.
And when they came back and told us about it, we really started thinking about the ways in which we see Styrofoam every day.
Get a new flat-screen TV?
You end up with a block of Styrofoam bigger than the TV itself.
Drink a cup of coffee?
Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups are sure going to add up.
And where do all these items go after their one-time use?
Since there aren't any good existing solutions for used Styrofoam, almost all of them end up right in the landfill, or the oceans and beaches, taking over 500 years to degrade.
And in fact, every year, the US alone produces over two billion pounds of Styrofoam, filling up a staggering 25 percent of landfills.
So why do we have these ghost accumulations of Styrofoam waste?
Why can't we just recycle them like many plastics?
Well, simply put, recycled polystyrene is too expensive and potentially contaminated, so there is very little market demand for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.
And as a result, Styrofoam is considered a nonrenewable material, because it is neither feasible nor viable to recycle polystyrene.
And in fact, many cities across the US have even passed ordinances that simply ban the production of many products containing polystyrene, which includes disposable utensils, packing peanuts, takeout containers and even plastic beach toys, all products that are very useful in today's society.
And now France has become the first country to completely ban all plastic utensils, cups and plates.
But what if we could keep using Styrofoam and keep benefiting from its cheap, lightweight, insulating and excellent packing ability, while not having to suffer from the repercussions of having to dispose of it?
What if we could turn it into something else that's actually useful?
What if we could make the impossible possible?
My team hypothesized that we could use the carbon that's already in Styrofoam to create activated carbon, which is used in almost every water filter today.
And activated carbon works by using very small micropores to filter out contaminants from water or even air.
So we started out by doing a variety of heating tests, and unfortunately, we had many failures. Literally, nothing worked. Besides my dad's grill catching on fire, most of our samples vaporized into nothing, or exploded inside expensive furnaces, leaving a horribly sticky mess.
In fact, we were so saddened by our failures that we almost gave up.
So why did we keep trying when all the adults said it was impossible?
Well, maybe it's because we're kids. We don't know any better.
But the truth is, we kept trying because we thought it was still possible.
We knew that if we were successful, we would be helping the environment and making the world a better place.
So we kept trying and failing and trying and failing.
We were so ready to give up.
But then it happened. With the right temperatures, times and chemicals, we finally got that successful test result showing us that we had created activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.
And at that moment, the thing that had been impossible all of a sudden wasn't.
It showed us that although we had many failures at the beginning, we were able to persevere through them to get the test results that we wanted.
And moreover, not only were we able to create activated carbon for purifying water, but we were also able to reduce Styrofoam waste, solving two global problems with just one solution.
So from then on, we were inspired to take our project further, performing more tests to make it more effective and testing it in real world situations.
We then proceeded to receive funding from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION STEM-in-Action program sponsored by the US Army, as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards sponsored by XPRIZE.
And we were also honored with the Scientific American Innovator Award from Google Science Fair.
And using these funds, we plan to file a full patent on our process and to continue to work on our project.
So yes, although we started with catching my dad's grill on fire and failing so many times that we almost quit, it was well worth it when we look back at it now.
We took a problem that many people said was impossible and we made it possible, and we persevered when it looked like nothing that we did would work.
We learned that you can't have success without a little, or a lot, of failure.
So in the future, don't be afraid if your grill goes up in flames, because you never know when your idea might just catch fire.
Thank you. (Applause)
Have you ever heard the one about how breastfeeding is free?
(Laughter)
Yeah, it's pretty funny, because it's only free if we don't value women's time and energy.
Any mother can tell you how much time and energy it takes to liquify her body -- to literally dissolve herself --
(Laughter)
as she feeds this precious little cannibal.
(Laughter)
Milk is why mammals suck.
At Arizona State University, in the Comparative Lactation Lab, I decode mothers' milk composition to understand its complexity and how it influences infant development.
The most important thing that I've learned is that we do not do enough to support mothers and babies.
And when we fail mothers and babies, we fail everyone who loves mothers and babies: the fathers, the partners, the grandparents, the aunties, the friends and kin that make our human social networks.
It's time that we abandon simple solutions and simple slogans, and grapple with the nuance.
I was very fortunate to run smack-dab into that nuance very early, during my first interview with a journalist when she asked me, "How long should a mother breastfeed her baby?" And it was that word "should" that brought me up short, because I will never tell a woman what she should do with her body.
Babies survive and thrive because their mother's milk is food, medicine and signal.
For young infants, mother's milk is a complete diet that provides all the building blocks for their bodies, that shapes their brain and fuels all of their activity.
Mother's milk also feeds the microbes that are colonizing the infant's intestinal tract.
Mothers aren't just eating for two, they're eating for two to the trillions.
Milk provides immunofactors that help fight pathogens and mother's milk provides hormones that signal to the infant's body.
But in recent decades, we have come to take milk for granted.
We stopped seeing something in plain sight.
We began to think of milk as standardized, homogenized, pasteurized, packaged, powdered, flavored and formulated.
We abandoned the milk of human kindness and turned our priorities elsewhere.
At the National Institutes of Health in Washington DC is the National Library of Medicine, which contains 25 million articles -- the brain trust of life science and biomedical research.
We can use keywords to search that database, and when we do that, we discover nearly a million articles about pregnancy, but far fewer about breast milk and lactation.
When we zoom in on the number of articles just investigating breast milk, we see that we know much more about coffee, wine and tomatoes.
(Laughter)
We know over twice as much about erectile dysfunction.
(Laughter)
I'm not saying we shouldn't know about those things -- I'm a scientist, I think we should know about everything.
But that we know so much less --
(Laughter)
about breast milk -- the first fluid a young mammal is adapted to consume -- should make us angry.
Globally, nine out of 10 women will have at least one child in her lifetime.
That means that nearly 130 million babies are born each year.
These mothers and babies deserve our best science.
Recent research has shown that milk doesn't just grow the body, it fuels behavior and shapes neurodevelopment.
In 2015, researchers discovered that the mixture of breast milk and baby saliva -- specifically, baby saliva -- causes a chemical reaction that produces hydrogen peroxide that can kill staph and salmonella.
And from humans and other mammal species, we're starting to understand that the biological recipe of milk can be different when produced for sons or daughters.
When we reach for donor milk in the neonatal intensive care unit, or formula on the store shelf, it's nearly one-size-fits-all.
We aren't thinking about how sons and daughters may grow at different rates, or different ways, and that milk may be a part of that.
Mothers have gotten the message and the vast majority of mothers intend to breastfeed, but many do not reach their breastfeeding goals.
That is not their failure; it's ours.
Increasingly common medical conditions like obesity, endocrine disorders, C-section and preterm births all can disrupt the underlying biology of lactation.
And many women do not have knowledgeable clinical support.
Twenty-five years ago, the World Health Organization and UNICEF established criteria for hospitals to be considered baby friendly -- that provide the optimal level of support for mother-infant bonding and infant feeding.
Today, only one in five babies in the United States is born in a baby-friendly hospital.
This is a problem, because mothers can grapple with many problems in the minutes, hours, days and weeks of lactation.
They can have struggles with establishing latch, with pain, with milk letdown and perceptions of milk supply.
These mothers deserve knowledgeable clinical staff that understand these processes.
Mothers will call me as they're grappling with these struggles, crying with wobbly voices. "It's not working.
This is what I'm supposed to naturally be able to do.
Why is it not working?" And just because something is evolutionarily ancient doesn't mean that it's easy or that we're instantly good at it.
You know what else is evolutionarily ancient?
(Laughter)
Sex. And nobody expects us to start out being good at it.
(Laughter)
Clinicians best deliver quality equitable care when they have continuing education about how to best support lactation and breastfeeding.
And in order to have that continuing education, we need to anchor it to cutting-edge research in both the life sciences and the social sciences, because we need to recognize that too often historical traumas and implicit biases sit in the space between a new mother and her clinician.
The body is political.
If our breastfeeding support is not intersectional, it's not good enough.
And for moms who have to return for work, because countries like the United States do not provide paid parental leave, they can have to go back in as short as just a few days after giving birth.
How do we optimize mother and infant health just by messaging about breast milk to moms without providing the institutional support that facilitates that mother-infant bonding to support breastfeeding?
The answer is: we can't.
I'm talking to you, legislators, and the voters who elect them.
I'm talking to you, job creators and collective bargaining units, and workers, and shareholders.
We all have a stake in the public health of our community, and we all have a role to play in achieving it.
Breast milk is a part of improving human health.
In the NICU, when infants are born early or sick or injured, milk or bioactive constituents in milk can be critically important.
Environments or ecologies, or communities where there's high risk of infectious disease, breast milk can be incredibly protective.
Where there are emergencies like storms and earthquakes, when the electricity goes out, when safe water is not available, breast milk can keep babies fed and hydrated.
And in the context of humanitarian crises, like Syrian mothers fleeing war zones, the smallest drops can buffer babies from the biggest global challenges.
But understanding breast milk is not just about messaging to mothers and policy makers.
It's also about understanding what is important in breast milk so that we can deliver better formulas to moms who cannot or do not breastfeed for whatever reason.
We can all do a better job of supporting the diversity of moms raising their babies in a diversity of ways.
As women around the world struggle to achieve political, social and economic equality, we must reimagine motherhood as not the central, core aspect of womanhood, but one of the many potential facets of what makes women awesome.
It's time.
(Applause)
So it all came to life in a dark bar in Madrid.
I encountered my colleague from McGill, Michael Meaney.
And we were drinking a few beers, and like scientists do, he told me about his work.
And he told me that he is interested in how mother rats lick their pups after they were born.
And I was sitting there and saying, "This is where my tax dollars are wasted — (Laughter) on this kind of soft science." And he started telling me that the rats, like humans, lick their pups in very different ways.
Some mothers do a lot of that, some mothers do very little, and most are in between.
But what's interesting about it is when he follows these pups when they become adults -- like, years in human life, long after their mother died. They are completely different animals.
The animals that were licked and groomed heavily, the high-licking and grooming, are not stressed.
They have different sexual behavior.
They have a different way of living than those that were not treated as intensively by their mothers.
So then I was thinking to myself: Is this magic? How does this work? As geneticists would like you to think, perhaps the mother had the "bad mother" gene that caused her pups to be stressful, and then it was passed from generation to generation; it's all determined by genetics.
Or is it possible that something else is going on here?
In rats, we can ask this question and answer it.
So what we did is a cross-fostering experiment.
You essentially separate the litter, the babies of this rat, at birth, to two kinds of fostering mothers -- not the real mothers, but mothers that will take care of them: high-licking mothers and low-licking mothers.
And you can do the opposite with the low-licking pups.
And the remarkable answer was, it wasn't important what gene you got from your mother.
It was not the biological mother that defined this property of these rats. It is the mother that took care of the pups.
So how can this work?
I am an a epigeneticist.
I am interested in how genes are marked by a chemical mark during embryogenesis, during the time we're in the womb of our mothers, and decide which gene will be expressed in what tissue.
Different genes are expressed in the brain than in the liver and the eye.
And we thought: Is it possible that the mother is somehow reprogramming the gene of her offspring through her behavior?
And we spent 10 years, and we found that there is a cascade of biochemical events by which the licking and grooming of the mother, the care of the mother, is translated to biochemical signals that go into the nucleus and into the DNA and program it differently.
So now the animal can prepare itself for life: Is life going to be harsh?
Is there going to be a lot of food?
Are there going to be a lot of cats and snakes around, or will I live in an upper-class neighborhood where all I have to do is behave well and proper, and that will gain me social acceptance?
And now one can think about how important that process can be for our lives.
We inherit our DNA from our ancestors.
The DNA is old.
It evolved during evolution.
But it doesn't tell us if you are going to be born in Stockholm, where the days are long in the summer and short in the winter, or in Ecuador, where there's an equal number of hours for day and night all year round.
And that has such an enormous [effect] on our physiology.
So what we suggest is, perhaps what happens early in life, those signals that come through the mother, tell the child what kind of social world you're going to be living in.
It will be harsh, and you'd better be anxious and be stressful, or it's going to be an easy world, and you have to be different.
Is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light?
Is it going to be a world with a lot of food or little food?
If there's no food around, you'd better develop your brain to binge whenever you see a meal, or store every piece of food that you have as fat.
So this is good. Evolution has selected this to allow our fixed, old DNA to function in a dynamic way in new environments.
But sometimes things can go wrong; for example, if you're born to a poor family and the signals are, "You better binge, you better eat every piece of food you're going to encounter." But now we humans and our brain have evolved, have changed evolution even faster.
Now you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.
And therefore, the preparation that we had by our mothers is turning out to be maladaptive.
The same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine is going to cause obesity, cardiovascular problems and metabolic disease.
So this concept that genes could be marked by our experience, and especially the early life experience, can provide us a unifying explanation of both health and disease.
But is true only for rats?
The problem is, we cannot test this in humans, because ethically, we cannot administer child adversity in a random way.
So if a poor child develops a certain property, we don't know whether this is caused by poverty or whether poor people have bad genes.
So geneticists will try to tell you that poor people are poor because their genes make them poor.
Epigeneticists will tell you poor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment that creates that phenotype, that property.
So we moved to look into our cousins, the monkeys.
My colleague, Stephen Suomi, has been rearing monkeys in two different ways: randomly separated the monkey from the mother and reared her with a nurse and surrogate motherhood conditions.
So these monkeys didn't have a mother; they had a nurse.
And other monkeys were reared with their normal, natural mothers.
And when they were old, they were completely different animals.
The monkeys that had a mother did not care about alcohol, they were not sexually aggressive.
The monkeys that didn't have a mother were aggressive, were stressed and were alcoholics.
So we looked at their DNA early after birth, to see: Is it possible that the mother is marking?
Is there a signature of the mother in the DNA of the offspring?
These are Day-14 monkeys, and what you see here is the modern way by which we study epigenetics.
We can now map those chemical marks, which we call methylation marks, on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.
We can map the entire genome.
We can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not.
And here's a visual presentation of this.
What you see is the genes that got more methylated are red.
The genes that got less met hylated are green.
You can see many genes are changing, because not having a mother is not just one thing -- it affects the whole way; it sends signals about the whole way your world is going to look when you become an adult.
And you can see the two groups of monkeys extremely well-separated from each other.
How early does this develop?
These monkeys already didn't see their mothers, so they had a social experience.
Do we sense our social status, even at the moment of birth?
So in this experiment, we took placentas of monkeys that had different social status.
What's interesting about social rank is that across all living beings, they will structure themselves by hierarchy.
Monkey number one is the boss; monkey number four is the peon.
You put four monkeys in a cage, there will always be a boss and always be a peon.
And what's interesting is that the monkey number one is much healthier than monkey number four.
And if you put them in a cage, monkey number one will not eat as much. Monkey number four will eat [a lot].
And what you see here in this methylation mapping, a dramatic separation at birth of the animals that had a high social status versus the animals that did not have a high status.
So we are born already knowing the social information, and that social information is not bad or good, it just prepares us for life, because we have to program our biology differently if we are in the high or the low social status.
But how can you study this in humans?
We can't do experiments, we can't administer adversity to humans.
But God does experiments with humans, and it's called natural disasters.
One of the hardest natural disasters in Canadian history happened in my province of Quebec.
It's the ice storm of 1998.
We lost our entire electrical grid because of an ice storm when the temperatures were, in the dead of winter in Quebec, minus 20 to minus 30. And there were pregnant mothers during that time.
And my colleague Suzanne King followed the children of these mothers for 15 years.
And what happened was, that as the stress increased -- and here we had objective measures of stress: How long were you without power? Where did you spend your time? Was it in your mother-in-law's apartment or in some posh country home?
So all of these added up to a social stress scale, and you can ask the question: How did the children look?
And it appears that as stress increases, the children develop more autism, they develop more metabolic diseases and they develop more autoimmune diseases.
We would map the methylation state, and again, you see the green genes becoming red as stress increases, the red genes becoming green as stress increases, an entire rearrangement of the genome in response to stress.
So if we can program genes, if we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes, that they could be programmed, can we deprogram them?
Because epigenetic causes can cause diseases like cancer, metabolic disease and mental health diseases.
Let's talk about cocaine addiction.
Cocaine addiction is a terrible situation that can lead to death and to loss of human life.
We asked the question: Can we reprogram the addicted brain to make that animal not addicted anymore?
We used a cocaine addiction model that recapitulates what happens in humans.
In humans, you're in high school, some friends suggest you use some cocaine, you take cocaine, nothing happens.
Months pass by, something reminds you of what happened the first time, a pusher pushes cocaine, and you become addicted and your life has changed.
In rats, we do the same thing.
My colleague, Gal Yadid, he trains the animals to get used to cocaine, then for one month, no cocaine.
Then he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time by cue, the colors of the cage when they saw cocaine. And they go crazy.
They will press the lever to get cocaine until they die.
We first determined that the difference between these animals is that during that time when nothing happens, there's no cocaine around, their epigenome is rearranged.
Their genes are re-marked in a different way, and when the cue comes, their genome is ready to develop this addictive phenotype.
So we treated these animals with drugs that either increase DNA methylation, which was the epigenetic marker to look at, or decrease epigenetic markings.
And we found that if we increased methylation, these animals go even crazier.
They become more craving for cocaine.
But if we reduce the DNA methylation, the animals are not addicted anymore.
We have reprogrammed them.
And a fundamental difference between an epigenetic drug and any other drug is that with epigenetic drugs, we essentially remove the signs of experience, and once they're gone, they will not come back unless you have the same experience.
The animal now is reprogrammed.
So when we visited the animals 30 days, 60 days later, which is in human terms many years of life, they were still not addicted -- by a single epigenetic treatment.
So what did we learn about DNA?
DNA is not just a sequence of letters; it's not just a script.
DNA is a dynamic movie.
Our experiences are being written into this movie, which is interactive.
You're, like, watching a movie of your life, with the DNA, with your remote control.
You can remove an actor and add an actor.
And so you have, in spite of the deterministic nature of genetics, you have control of the way your genes look, and this has a tremendous optimistic message for the ability to now encounter some of the deadly diseases like cancer, mental health, with a new approach, looking at them as maladaptation.
And if we can epigenetically intervene, [we can] reverse the movie by removing an actor and setting up a new narrative.
So what I told you today is, our DNA is really combined of two components, two layers of information.
One layer of information is old, evolved from millions of years of evolution. It is fixed and very hard to change.
The other layer of information is the epigenetic layer, which is open and dynamic and sets up a narrative that is interactive, that allows us to control, to a large extent, our destiny, to help the destiny of our children and to hopefully conquer disease and serious health challenges that have plagued humankind for a long time.
So even though we are determined by our genes, we have a degree of freedom that can set up our life to a life of responsibility.
Thank you. (Applause)
I was 10 years old when I learned what the word "genocide" meant.
It was 2003, and my people were being brutally attacked because of their race -- hundreds of thousands murdered, millions displaced, a nation torn apart at the hands of its own government.
My mother and father immediately began speaking out against the crisis.
I didn't really understand it, except for the fact that it was destroying my parents.
One day, I walked in on my mother crying, and I asked her why we are burying so many people.
I don't remember the words that she chose to describe genocide to her 10-year-old daughter, but I remember the feeling.
We felt completely alone, as if no one could hear us, as if we were essentially invisible.
This is when I wrote my first poem about Darfur.
I wrote poetry to convince people to hear and see us, and that's how I learned the thing that changed me.
It's easy to be seen.
I mean, look at me -- I'm a young African woman with a scarf around my head, an American accent on my tongue and a story that makes even the most brutal of Monday mornings seem inviting.
But it's hard to convince people that they deserve to be seen.
I learned this in my high school classroom one day, when my teacher asked me to give a presentation about Darfur.
I was setting up the projector when a classmate of mine said, "Why do you have to talk about this?
Can't you think about us and how it will make us feel?"
(Laughter)
My 14-year-old self didn't know what to say to her, or how to explain the pain that I felt in that moment, and in every moment that we were forced not to talk about "this." Her words took me back to the days and nights on the ground in Darfur, where we were forced to remain silent; where we didn't speak over morning tea because the warplanes overhead would swallow any and all noise; back to the days when we were told not only that we don't deserve to be heard but that we do not have a right to exist.
And this is where the magic happened, in that classroom when all the students started taking their seats and I began to speak, despite this renewed feeling that I didn't deserve to be there, that I didn't belong there or have a right to break the silence.
As I talked, and my classmates listened, the fear ebbed away. My mind became calm, and I felt safe.
It was the sound of our grieving, the feel of their arms around me, the steady walls that held us together.
It felt nothing like a vacuum.
I choose poetry because it's so visceral.
When someone is standing in front of you, mind, body and soul, saying "Witness me," it's impossible not to become keenly aware of your own humanity.
This changed everything for me.
It gave me courage.
Every day I experience the power of witness, and because of that, I am whole.
And so now I ask: Will you witness me?
They hand me the microphone as my shoulders sink under the weight of this stress.
The woman says, "The one millionth refugee just left South Sudan. Can you comment?"
I feel my feet rock back and forth on the heels my mother bought,
begging the question:
Do we stay, or is it safer to choose flight?
My mind echoes the numbers:
one million gone,
two million displaced,
400,000 dead in Darfur.
And this lump takes over my throat,
as if each of those bodies just found a grave
right here in my esophagus.
Our once country,
all north and south and east and west,
so restless the Nile couldn't hold us together,
and you ask me to summarize.
They talk about the numbers as if this isn't still happening,
as if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria,
as if 3,000 aren't still making their final stand
at the bottom of the Mediterranean,
as if there aren't entire volumes full of fact sheets about our genocides,
and now they want me to write one.
Fact:
we never talked over breakfast,
because the warplanes would swallow our voices.
Fact:
my grandfather didn't want to leave home,
so he died in a war zone.
Fact:
a burning bush without God is just a fire.
I measure the distance between what I know
and what is safe to say on a microphone.
Do I talk about sorrow? Displacement?
Do I mention the violence,
how it's never as simple as what you see on TV,
how there are weeks' worth of fear before the camera is on?
Do I tell her about our bodies,
how they are 60 percent water,
but we still burn like driftwood,
making fuel of our sacrifice?
Do I tell her the men died first, mothers forced to watch the slaughter?
That they came for our children,
scattering them across the continent until our homes sank?
That even castles sink at the bite of the bomb?
Do I talk about the elderly, our heroes,
too weak to run, too expensive to shoot,
how they would march them,
hands raised, rifles at their backs, into the fire?
How their walking sticks kept the flames alive?
It feels too harsh for a bundle of wires and an audience to swallow.
Too relentless,
like the valley that filled with the putrid smoke of our deaths.
Is it better in verse?
Can a stanza become a burial shroud?
Will it sting less if I say it softly?
If you don't see me cry, will you listen better?
Will the pain leave when the microphone does?
Why does every word feel as if I'm saying my last?
Thirty seconds for the sound bite,
and now three minutes for the poem.
My tongue goes dry the same way we died,
becoming ash, having never been coal.
I feel my left leg go numb,
and I realize that I locked my knees, bracing for impact.
I never wear shoes I can't run in.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, I wanted to leave on a positive note, because that's the paradox that this life has been: in the places where I learned to cry the most, I also learned how to smile after. So, here goes.
"You Have a Big Imagination or 400,000 Ways to Cry." For Zeinab.
I am a sad girl,
but my face makes other plans,
focusing energy on this smile, so as not to waste it on pain.
The first thing they took was my sleep,
eyes heavy but wide open,
thinking maybe I missed something,
maybe the cavalry is still coming.
They didn't come,
so I bought bigger pillows.
(Laughter)
My grandmother could cure anything
by talking the life out of it.
And she said that I could make a thief in a silo laugh in the middle of our raging war.
War makes a broken marriage bed out of sorrow.
You want nothing more than to disappear,
but your heart can't salvage enough remnants to leave.
But joy --
joy is the armor we carried across the borders of our broken homeland.
A hasty mix of stories and faces that lasts long after the flavor is gone.
A muscle memory that overcomes even the most bitter of times,
my memory is spotted with days of laughing until I cried,
or crying until I laughed.
Laughter and tears are both involunt ary human reactions,
testaments to our capacity for expression.
So allow me to express
that if I make you laugh, it's usually on purpose.
And if I make you cry, I'll still think you are beautiful.
This is for my cousin Zeinab,
bedridden on a random afternoon.
I hadn't seen her since the last time we were in Sudan together,
and there I was at her hospital bedside
in a 400-year-old building in France.
Zeinab wanted to hear poems.
Suddenly, English, Arabic and French were not enough.
Every word I knew became empty noise,
and Zeinab said, "Well, get on with it."
(Laughter)
And I read her everything that I could, and we laughed, and we loved it,
and it was the most important stage that I've ever stood on,
surrounded by family,
by remnants of a people who were given as a dowry to a relentless war
but still managed to make pearls of this life;
by the ones who taught me to not only laugh,
but to live in the face of death;
who placed their hands across the sky,
measuring the distance to the sun and saying, "Smile; I'm gonna meet you there."
And for Zeinab —
Zeinab, who taught me love in a place like France,
Zeinab, who wanted to he.ar poems on her deathbed —
Dilated fibromyalgia.
Her heart muscles expanded until they couldn't function.
And she held me, and she made me feel like gold.
And I said, "Zeinab,
isn't it strange that your only problem
is that your heart was too big?"
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the movie "Interstellar," we get an up-close look at a supermassive black hole.
Set against a backdrop of bright gas, the black hole's massive gravitational pull bends light into a ring.
However, this isn't a real photograph, but a computer graphic rendering -- an artistic interpretation of what a black hole might look like.
A hundred years ago, Albert Einstein first published his theory of general relativity.
In the years since then, scientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it.
But one thing predicted from this theory, black holes, still have not been directly observed.
Although we have some idea as to what a black hole might look like, we've never actually taken a picture of one before.
However, you might be surprised to know that that may soon change.
We may be seeing our first picture of a black hole in the next couple years.
Getting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists, an Earth-sized telescope and an algorithm that puts together the final picture.
Although I won't be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today, I'd like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved in getting that first picture.
My name is Katie Bouman, and I'm a PhD student at MIT.
I do research in a computer science lab that works on making computers see through images and video.
But although I'm not an astronomer, today I'd like to show you how I've been able to contribute to this exciting project.
If you go out past the bright city lights tonight, you may just be lucky enough to see a stunning view of the Milky Way Galaxy.
And if you could zoom past millions of stars, 26,000 light-years toward the heart of the spiraling Milky Way, we'd eventually reach a cluster of stars right at the center.
Peering past all the galactic dust with infrared telescopes, astronomers have watched these stars for over 16 years.
But it's what they don't see that is the most spectacular.
These stars seem to orbit an invisible object.
By tracking the paths of these stars, astronomers have concluded that the only thing small and heavy enough to cause this motion is a supermassive black hole -- an object so dense that it sucks up anything that ventures too close -- even light.
But what happens if we were to zoom in even further?
Is it possible to see something that, by definition, is impossible to see?
Well, it turns out that if we were to zoom in at radio wavelengths, we'd expect to see a ring of light caused by the gravitational lensing of hot plasma zipping around the black hole.
In other words, the black hole casts a shadow on this backdrop of bright material, carving out a sphere of darkness.
This bright ring reveals the black hole's event horizon, where the gravitational pull becomes so great that not even light can escape.
Einstein's equations predict the size and shape of this ring, so taking a picture of it wouldn't only be really cool, it would also help to verify that these equations hold in the extreme conditions around the black hole.
However, this black hole is so far away from us, that from Earth, this ring appears incredibly small -- the same size to us as an orange on the surface of the moon.
That makes taking a picture of it extremely difficult. Why is that? Well, it all comes down to a simple equation.
Due to a phenomenon called diffraction, there are fundamental limits to the smallest objects that we can possibly see.
This governing equation says that in order to see smaller and smaller, we need to make our telescope bigger and bigger.
But even with the most powerful optical telescopes here on Earth, we can't even get close to the resolution necessary to image on the surface of the moon.
In fact, here I show one of the highest resolution images ever taken of the moon from Earth.
It contains roughly 13,000 pixels, and yet each pixel would contain over 1.5 million oranges.
So how big of a telescope do we need in order to see an orange on the surface of the moon and, by extension, our black hole?
Well, it turns out that by crunching the numbers, you can easily calculate that we would need a telescope the size of the entire Earth.
(Laughter)
If we could build this Earth-sized telescope, we could just start to make out that distinctive ring of light indicative of the black hole's event horizon.
Although this picture wouldn't contain all the detail we see in computer graphic renderings, it would allow us to safely get our first glimpse of the immediate environment around a black hole.
However, as you can imagine, building a single-dish telescope the size of the Earth is impossible.
But in the famous words of Mick Jagger, "You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find you get what you need." And by connecting telescopes from around the world, an international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope is creating a computational telescope the size of the Earth, capable of resolving structure on the scale of a black hole's event horizon.
This network of telescopes is scheduled to take its very first picture of a black hole next year.
Each telescope in the worldwide network works together.
Linked through the precise timing of atomic clocks, teams of researchers at each of the sites freeze light by collecting thousands of terabytes of data.
This data is then processed in a lab right here in Massachusetts.
So how does this even work? Remember if we want to see the black hole in the center of our galaxy, we need to build this impossibly large Earth-sized telescope?
For just a second, let's pretend we could build a telescope the size of the Earth.
This would be a little bit like turning the Earth into a giant spinning disco ball.
Each individual mirror would collect light that we could then combine together to make a picture.
However, now let's say we remove most of those mirrors so only a few remained.
We could still try to combine this information together, but now there are a lot of holes.
These remaining mirrors represent the locations where we have telescopes.
This is an incredibly small number of measurements to make a picture from.
But although we only collect light at a few telescope locations, as the Earth rotates, we get to see other new measurements.
In other words, as the disco ball spins, those mirrors change locations and we get to observe different parts of the image.
The imaging algorithms we develop fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball in order to reconstruct the underlying black hole image.
If we had telescopes located everywhere on the globe -- in other words, the entire disco ball -- this would be trivial.
However, we only see a few samples, and for that reason, there are an infinite number of possible images that are perfectly consistent with our telescope measurements.
However, not all images are created equal.
Some of those images look more like what we think of as images than others.
And so, my role in helping to take the first image of a black hole is to design algorithms that find the most reasonable image that also fits the telescope measurements.
Just as a forensic sketch artist uses limited descriptions to piece together a picture using their knowledge of face structure, the imaging algorithms I develop use our limited telescope data to guide us to a picture that also looks like stuff in our universe.
Using these algorithms, we're able to piece together pictures from this sparse, noisy data.
So here I show a sample reconstruction done using simulated data, when we pretend to point our telescopes to the black hole in the center of our galaxy.
Although this is just a simulation, reconstruction such as this give us hope that we'll soon be able to reliably take the first image of a black hole and from it, determine the size of its ring.
Although I'd love to go on about all the details of this algorithm, luckily for you, I don't have the time.
But I'd still like to give you a brief idea of how we define what our universe looks like, and how we use this to reconstruct and verify our results.
Since there are an infinite number of possible images that perfectly explain our telescope measurements, we have to choose between them in some way.
We do this by ranking the images based upon how likely they are to be the black hole image, and then choosing the one that's most likely.
So what do I mean by this exactly?
Let's say we were trying to make a model that told us how likely an image were to appear on Facebook.
We'd probably want the model to say it's pretty unlikely that someone would post this noise image on the left, and pretty likely that someone would post a selfie like this one on the right.
The image in the middle is blurry, so even though it's more likely we'd see it on Facebook compared to the noise image, it's probably less likely we'd see it compared to the selfie.
But when it comes to images from the black hole, we're posed with a real conundrum: we've never seen a black hole before.
In that case, what is a likely black hole image, and what should we assume about the structure of black holes?
We could try to use images from simulations we've done, like the image of the black hole from "Interstellar," but if we did this, it could cause some serious problems.
What would happen if Einstein's theories didn't hold?
We'd still want to reconstruct an accurate picture of what was going on.
If we bake Einstein's equations too much into our algorithms, we'll just end up seeing what we expect to see.
In other words, we want to leave the option open for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy.
(Laughter)
Different types of images have very distinct features.
We can easily tell the difference between black hole simulation images and images we take every day here on Earth.
We need a way to tell our algorithms what images look like without imposing one type of image's features too much.
One way we can try to get around this is by imposing the features of different kinds of images and seeing how the type of image we assume affects our reconstructions.
If all images' types produce a very similar-looking image, then we can start to become more confident that the image assumptions we're making are not biasing this picture that much.
This is a little bit like giving the same description to three different sketch artists from all around the world.
If they all produce a very similar-looking face, then we can start to become confident that they're not imposing their own cultural biases on the drawings.
One way we can try to impose different image features is by using pieces of existing images.
So we take a large collection of images, and we break them down into their little image patches.
We then can treat each image patch a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.
And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces to piece together an image that also fits our telescope measurements.
Different types of images have very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.
So what happens when we take the same data but we use different sets of puzzle pieces to reconstruct the image?
Let's first start with black hole image simulation puzzle pieces. OK, this looks reasonable. This looks like what we expect a black hole to look like.
But did we just get it because we just fed it little pieces of black hole simulation images?
Let's try another set of puzzle pieces from astronomical, non-black hole objects.
OK, we get a similar-looking image.
And then how about pieces from everyday images, like the images you take with your own personal camera?
Great, we see the same image.
then we can start to become more confident When we get the same image from all different sets of puzzle pieces, that the image assumptions we're making aren't biasing the final image we get too much.
Another thing we can do is take the same set of puzzle pieces, such as the ones derived from everyday images, and use them to reconstruct many different kinds of source images.
So in our simulations, we pretend a black hole looks like astronomical non-black hole objects, as well as everyday images like the elephant in the center of our galaxy.
When the results of our algorithms on the bottom look very similar to the simulation's truth image on top, then we can start to become more confident in our algorithms.
And I really want to emphasize here that all of these pictures were created by piecing together little pieces of everyday photographs, like you'd take with your own personal camera.
So an image of a black hole we've never seen before may eventually be created by piecing together pictures we see all the time of people, buildings, trees, cats and dogs.
Imaging ideas like this will make it possible for us to take our very first pictures of a black hole, and hopefully, verify those famous theories on which scientists rely on a daily basis.
But of course, getting imaging ideas like this working would never have been possible without the amazing team of researchers that I have the privilege to work with.
It still amazes me that although I began this project with no background in astrophysics, what we have achieved through this unique collaboration could result in the very first images of a black hole.
But big projects like the Event Horizon Telescope are successful due to all the interdisciplinary expertise different people bring to the table.
We're a melting pot of astronomers, physicists, mathematicians and engineers.
This is what will make it soon possible to achieve something once thought impossible.
I'd like to encourage all of you to go out and help push the boundaries of science, even if it may at first seem as mysterious to you as a black hole.
Thank you.
(Applause)
No one will ever pay you what you're worth.
No one will ever pay you what you're worth.
They'll only ever pay you what they think you're worth.
And you control their thinking, not like this, although that would be cool.
(Laughter)
That would be really cool. Instead, like this: clearly defining and communicating your value are essential to being paid well for your excellence.
Anyone here want to be paid well?
OK, good, then this talk is for everyone.
It's got universal applicability.
It's true if you're a business owner, if you're an employee, if you're a job seeker. It's true if you're a man or a woman.
Now, I approach this today through the lens of the woman business owner, because in my work I've observed that women underprice more so than men.
The gender wage gap is a well-traveled narrative in this country.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a woman employee earns just 83 cents for every dollar a man earns.
What may surprise you is that this trend continues even into the entrepreneurial sphere.
A woman business owner earns just 80 cents for every dollar a man earns.
In my work, I've often heard women express that they're uncomfortable communicating their value, especially early on in business ownership.
They say things like, "I don't like to toot my own horn." "I'd rather let the work speak for itself." "I don't like to sing my own praises."
I hear very different narratives in working with male business owners, and I think this difference is costing women 20 cents on the dollar.
I'd like to tell you the story of a consulting firm that helps their clients dramatically improve their profitability.
That company is my company.
After my first year in business, I saw the profit increases that my clients were realizing in working with me, and I realized that I needed to reevaluate my pricing.
I was really underpriced relative to the value I was delivering.
It's hard for me to admit to you, because I'm a pricing consultant.
(Laughter)
It's what I do.
I help companies price for value.
But nonetheless, it's what I saw, and so I sat down to evaluate my pricing, evaluate my value, and I did that by asking key value questions.
What are my clients' needs and how do I meet them?
What is my unique skill set that makes me better qualified to serve my clients?
What do I do that no one else does?
What problems do I solve for clients?
What value do I add?
I answered these questions and defined the value that my clients get from working with me, calculated their return on investment, and what I saw was that I needed to double my price, double it.
Now, I confess to you, this terrified me.
I'm supposed to be the expert in this, but I'm not cured.
I knew the value was there.
I was convinced the value was there, and I was still scared out of my wits.
What if nobody would pay me that?
What if clients said, "That's ridiculous.
You're ridiculous."
Was I really worth that? Not my work, mind you, but me. Was I worth that? I'm the mother of two beautiful little girls who depend upon me.
I'm a single mom.
What if my business fails?
What if I fail?
But I know how to take my own medicine, the medicine that I prescribe to my clients.
I had done the homework.
I knew the value was there.
So when prospects came, I prepared the proposals with the new higher pricing and sent them out and communicated the value.
How's the story end?
Clients continued to hire me and refer me and recommend me, and I'm still here.
And I share this story because doubts and fears are natural and normal.
But they don't define our value, and they shouldn't limit our earning potential.
I'd like to share another story, about a woman who learned to communicate her value and found her own voice.
She runs a successful web development company and employs several people.
When she first started her firm and for several years thereafter, she would say, "I have a little web design company." She'd actually use those words with clients. "I have a little web design company." In this and in many other small ways, she was diminishing her company in the eyes of prospects and clients, and diminishing herself.
It was really impacting her ability to earn what she was worth.
I believe her language and her style communicated that she didn't believe she had much value to offer.
In her own words, she was practically giving her services away.
And so she began her journey to take responsibility for communicating value to clients and changing her message.
One thing I shared with her is that it's so important to find your own voice, a voice that's authentic and true to you.
Don't try to channel your sister-in-law just because she's a great salesperson or your neighbor who tells a great joke if that's not who you are.
Give up this notion that it's tooting your own horn.
Make it about the other party.
Focus on serving and adding value, and it won't feel like bragging.
What do you love about what you do?
What excites you about the work that you do?
If you connect with that, communicating your value will come naturally.
So she embraced her natural style, found her voice and changed her message.
For one thing, she stopped calling herself a little web design company.
She really found a lot of strength and power in communicating her message.
She's now charging three times as much for web design, and her business is growing.
She told me about a recent meeting with a gruff and sometimes difficult client who had called a meeting questioning progress on search engine optimization.
She said in the old days, that would have been a really intimidating meeting for her, but her mindset was different.
She said, she prepared the information, sat down with the client, said this isn't about me, it's not personal, it's about the client.
She took them through the data, through the numbers, laid out the trends and the progress in her own voice and in her own way, but very directly said, "Here's what we've done for you." The client sat up and took notice, and said, "OK, I got it." And she said in describing that meeting, "I didn't feel scared or panicky or small, which is how I used to feel.
Instead I feel like, 'OK, I got this.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm confident. '"
Being properly valued is so important.
You can hear in this story that the implications range far beyond just finances into the realm of self-respect and self-confidence.
Today I've told two stories, one about defining our value and the other about communicating our value, and these are the two elements to realizing our full earning potential. That's the equation. And if you're sitting in the audience today and you're not being paid what you're worth, I'd like to welcome you into this equation.
Just imagine what life could be like, how much more we could do, how much more we could give back, how much more we could plan for the future, how validated and respected we would feel if we could earn our full potential, realize our full value.
No one will ever pay you what you're worth.
They'll only ever pay you what they think you're worth, and you control their thinking.
Thank you.
(Applause)
An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine told the story of Clyde Murphy, a black man who was a member of the Class of 1970. Clyde was a success story. After Yale and a law degree from Columbia, Clyde spent the next 30 years as one of America's top civil rights lawyers.
He was also a great husband and father.
But despite his success, personally and professionally, Clyde's story had a sad ending.
In 2010, at the age of 62, Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung.
Clyde's experience was not unique.
Many of his black classmates from Yale also died young.
In fact, the magazine article indicated that 41 years after graduation from Yale, the black members of the Class of 1970 had a death rate that was three times higher than that of the average class member. It's stunning.
America has recently awakened to a steady drumbeat of unarmed black men being shot by the police.
What is even a bigger story is that every seven minutes, a black person dies prematurely in the United States.
That is over 200 black people die every single day who would not die if the health of blacks and whites were equal.
For the last 25 years, I have been on a mission to understand why does race matter so profoundly for health.
When I started my career, many believed that it was simply about racial differences in income and education.
I discovered that while economic status matters for health, there is more to the story.
So for example, if we look at life expectancy at age 25, at age 25 there's a five-year gap between blacks and whites.
And the gap by education for both whites and blacks is even larger than the racial gap.
At the same time, at every level of education, whites live longer than blacks.
So whites who are high school dropouts live 3.4 years longer than their black counterparts, and the gap is even larger among college graduates.
Most surprising of all, whites who have graduated from high school live longer than blacks with a college degree or more education.
So why does race matter so profoundly for health?
What else is it beyond education and income that might matter?
In the early 1990s, I was asked to review a new book on the health of black America.
I was struck that almost every single one of its 25 chapters said that racism was a factor that was hurting the health of blacks.
All of these researchers were stating that racism was a factor adversely impacting blacks, but they provided no evidence.
For me, that was not good enough.
A few months later, I was speaking at a conference in Washington, DC, and I said that one of the priorities for research was to document the ways in which racism affected health.
A white gentleman stood in the audience and said that while he agreed with me that racism was important, we could never measure racism. "We measure self-esteem," I said. "There's no reason why we can't measure racism if we put our minds to it."
And so I put my mind to it and developed three scales.
The first one captured major experiences of discrimination, like being unfairly fired or being unfairly stopped by the police.
But discrimination also occurs in more minor and subtle experiences, and so my second scale, called the Everyday Discrimination Scale, captures nine items that captures experiences like you're treated with less courtesy than others, you receive poorer service than others in restaurants or stores, or people act as if they're afraid of you.
This scale captures ways in which the dignity and the respect of people who society does not value is chipped away on a daily basis.
Research has found that higher levels of discrimination are associated with an elevated risk of a broad range of diseases from blood pressure to abdominal obesity to breast cancer to heart disease and even premature mortality.
Strikingly, some of the effects are observed at a very young age.
For example, a study of black teens found that those who reported higher levels of discrimination as teenagers had higher levels of stress hormones, of blood pressure and of weight at age 20.
However, the stress of discrimination is only one aspect.
Discrimination and racism also matters in other profound ways for health.
For example, there's discrimination in medical care.
In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine asked me to serve on a committee that found, concluded based on the scientific evidence, that blacks and other minorities receive poorer quality care than whites.
This was true for all kinds of medical treatment, from the most simple to the most technologically sophisticated.
One explanation for this pattern was a phenomenon that's called "implicit bias" or "unconscious discrimination." Research for decades by social psychologists indicates that if you hold a negative stereotype about a group in your subconscious mind and you meet someone from that group, you will discriminate against that person.
You will treat them differently.
It's an unconscious process.
It's an automatic process.
It is a subtle process, but it's normal and it occurs even among the most well-intentioned individuals.
But the deeper that I delved into the health impact of racism, the more insidious the effects became.
There is institutional discrimination, which refers to discrimination that exists in the processes of social institutions.
Residential segregation by race, which has led to blacks and whites living in very different neighborhood contexts, is a classic example of institutional racism.
One of America's best-kept secrets is how residential segregation is the secret source that creates racial inequality in the United States.
In America, where you live determines your access to opportunities in education, in employment, in housing and even in access to medical care.
One study of the 171 largest cities in the United States concluded that there is not even one city where whites live under equal conditions to blacks, and that the worst urban contexts in which whites reside is considerably better than the average context of black communities.
Another study found that if you could eliminate statistically residential segregation, you would completely erase black-white differences in income, education and unemployment, and reduce black-white differences in single motherhood by two thirds, all of that driven by segregation.
I have also learned how the negative stereotypes and images of blacks in our culture literally create and sustain both institutional and individual discrimination.
A group of researchers have put together a database that contains the books, magazines and articles that an average college-educated American would read over their lifetime.
It allows us to look within this database and see how Americans have seen words paired together as they grow up in their society.
So when the word "black" appears in American culture, what co-occurs with it? "Poor," "violent," "religious," "lazy," "cheerful," "dangerous." When "white" occurs, the frequently co-occurring words are "wealthy," "progressive," "conventional," "stubborn," "successful," "educated." So when a police officer overreacts when he sees an unarmed black male and perceives him to be violent and dangerous, we are not necessarily dealing with an inherently bad cop.
We may be simply viewing a normal American who is reflecting what he has been exposed to as a result of being raised in this society.
From my own experience, I believe that your race does not have to be a determinant of your destiny.
I migrated to the United States from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia in the late 1970s in pursuit of higher education, and in the last 40 years, I have done well.
I have done well. I have had a supportive family, I have worked hard,
But it took more for me to be successful.
I received a minority fellowship from the University of Michigan. Yes. I am an affirmative action baby.
Without affirmative action, I would not be here.
But in the last 40 years, black America has been less successful than I have.
In 1978, black households in the United States earned 59 cents for every dollar of income whites earned.
In 2015, black families still earn 59 cents for every dollar of income that white families receive, and the racial gaps in wealth are even more stunning.
For every dollar of wealth that whites have, black families have six pennies and Latinos have seven pennies.
The fact is, racism is producing a truly rigged system that is systematically disadvantaging some racial groups in the United States.
To paraphrase Plato, there is nothing so unfair as the equal treatment of unequal people.
And that's why I am committed to working to dismantle racism.
I deeply appreciate the fact that I am standing on the shoulders of those who have sacrificed even their lives to open the doors that I have walked through.
I want to ensure that those doors remain open and that everyone can walk through those doors.
Robert Kennedy said, "Each time a man" -- or woman, I would add -- "stands up for an ideal or acts to improve the lot of others or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and those ripples can build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."
I am optimistic today because all across America, I have seen ripples of hope.
The Boston Medical Center has added lawyers to the medical team so that physicians can improve the health of their patients because the lawyers are addressing the nonmedical needs their patients have.
Loma Linda University has built a gateway college in nearby San Bernardino so that in addition to delivering medical care, they can provide job skills and job training to a predominantly minority, low-income community members so that they will have the skills they need to get a decent job.
In Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the Abecedarian Project has figured out how to ensure that they have lowered the risks for heart disease for blacks in their mid-30s by providing high-quality day care from birth to age five.
In after-school centers across the United States, Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy is breaking the cycle of incarceration by providing high-quality academic enrichment and mentoring to the children of prisoners and children who have fallen behind in school.
In Huntsville, Alabama, Oakwood University, a historically black institution, is showing how we can improve the health of black adults by including a health evaluation as a part of freshman orientation and giving those students the tools they need to make healthy choices and providing them annually a health transcript so they can monitor their progress.
And in Atlanta, Georgia, Purpose Built Communities has dismantled the negative effects of segregation by transforming a crime-ridden, drug-infested public housing project into an oasis of mixed-income housing, of academic performance, of great community wellness and of full employment.
And finally, there is the Devine solution.
Professor Patricia Devine of the University of Wisconsin has shown us how we can attack our hidden biases head on and effectively reduce them.
Each one of us can be a ripple of hope.
This work will not always be easy, but former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall has told us, "We must dissent.
We must dissent from the indifference.
We must dissent from the apathy.
We must dissent from the hatred and from the mistrust.
We must dissent because America can do better, because America has no choice but to do better."
Thank you.

This is what my last week looked like.
What I did, who I was with, the main sensations I had for every waking hour ... If the feeling came as I thought of my dad who recently passed away, or if I could have just definitely avoided the worries and anxieties.
And if you think I'm a little obsessive, you're probably right.
But clearly, from this visualization, you can learn much more about me than from this other one, which are images you're probably more familiar with and which you possibly even have on your phone right now.
Bar charts for the steps you walked, pie charts for the quality of your sleep -- the path of your morning runs.
In my day job, I work with data.
I run a data visualization design company, and we design and develop ways to make information accessible through visual representations.
What my job has taught me over the years is that to really understand data and their true potential, sometimes we actually have to forget about them and see through them instead.
Because data are always just a tool we use to represent reality.
They're always used as a placeholder for something else, but they are never the real thing.
But let me step back for a moment to when I first understood this personally.
In 1994, I was 13 years old.
I was a teenager in Italy.
I was too young to be interested in politics, but I knew that a businessman, Silvio Berlusconi, was running for president for the moderate right.
We lived in a very liberal town, and my father was a politician for the Democratic Party.
And I remember that no one thought that Berlusconi could get elected -- that was totally not an option. But it happened. And I remember the feeling very vividly.
It was a complete surprise, as my dad promised that in my town he knew nobody who voted for him.
This was the first time when the data I had gave me a completely distorted image of reality.
My data sample was actually pretty limited and skewed, so probably it was because of that, I thought, I lived in a bubble, and I didn't have enough chances to see outside of it.
Now, fast-forward to November 8, 2016 in the United States.
The internet polls, statistical models, all the pundits agreeing on a possible outcome for the presidential election.
It looked like we had enough information this time, and many more chances to see outside the closed circle we lived in -- but we clearly didn't.
The feeling felt very familiar.
I had been there before.
I think it's fair to say the data failed us this time -- and pretty spectacularly.
We believed in data, but what happened, even with the most respected newspaper, is that the obsession to reduce everything to two simple percentage numbers to make a powerful headline made us focus on these two digits and them alone.
In an effort to simplify the message and draw a beautiful, inevitable red and blue map, we lost the point completely.
We somehow forgot that there were stories -- stories of human beings behind these numbers.
In a different context, but to a very similar point, a peculiar challenge was presented to my team by this woman.
She came to us with a lot of data, but ultimately she wanted to tell one of the most humane stories possible.
She's Samantha Cristoforetti.
She has been the first Italian woman astronaut, and she contacted us before being launched on a six-month-long expedition to the International Space Station.
She told us, "I'm going to space, and I want to do something meaningful with the data of my mission to reach out to people." A mission to the International Space Station comes with terabytes of data about anything you can possibly imagine -- the orbits around Earth, the speed and position of the ISS and all of the other thousands of live streams from its sensors.
We had all of the hard data we could think of -- just like the pundits before the election -- but what is the point of all these numbers?
People are not interested in data for the sake of it, because numbers are never the point.
They're always the means to an end.
The story we needed to tell is that there is a human being in a teeny box flying in space above your head, and that you can actually see her with your naked eye on a clear night.
So we decided to use data to create a connection between Samantha and all of the people looking at her from below.
We designed and developed what we called "Friends in Space," a web application that simply lets you say "hello" to Samantha from where you are, and "hello" to all the people who are online at the same time from all over the world.
And all of these "hellos" left visible marks on the map as Samantha was flying by and as she was actually waving back every day at us using Twitter from the ISS.
This made people see the mission's data from a very different perspective.
It all suddenly became much more about our human nature and our curiosity, rather than technology.
So data powered the experience, but stories of human beings were the drive.
The very positive response of its thousands of users taught me a very important lesson -- that working with data means designing ways to transform the abstract and the uncountable into something that can be seen, felt and directly reconnected to our lives and to our behaviors, something that is hard to achieve if we let the obsession for the numbers and the technology around them lead us in the process.
But we can do even more to connect data to the stories they represent.
We can remove technology completely.
A few years ago, I met this other woman, Stefanie Posavec -- a London-based designer who shares with me the passion and obsession about data.
We didn't know each other, but we decided to run a very radical experiment, starting a communication using only data, no other language, and we opted for using no technology whatsoever to share our data.
In fact, our only means of communication would be through the old-fashioned post office.
For "Dear Data," every week for one year, we used our personal data to get to know each other -- personal data around weekly shared mundane topics, from our feelings to the interactions with our partners, from the compliments we received to the sounds of our surroundings.
Personal information that we would then manually hand draw on a postcard-size sheet of paper that we would every week send from London to New York, where I live, and from New York to London, where she lives.
The front of the postcard is the data drawing, and the back of the card contains the address of the other person, of course, and the legend for how to interpret our drawing.
The very first week into the project, we actually chose a pretty cold and impersonal topic.
How many times do we check the time in a week?
So here is the front of my card, and you can see that every little symbol represents all of the times that I checked the time, positioned for days and different hours chronologically -- nothing really complicated here.
But then you see in the legend how I added anecdotal details about these moments.
In fact, the different types of symbols indicate why I was checking the time -- what was I doing? Was I bored? Was I hungry? Was I late? Did I check it on purpose or just casually glance at the clock?
And this is the key part -- representing the details of my days and my personality through my data collection.
Using data as a lens or a filter to discover and reveal, for example, my never-ending anxiety for being late, even though I'm absolutely always on time.
Stefanie and I spent one year collecting our data manually to force us to focus on the nuances that computers cannot gather -- or at least not yet -- using data also to explore our minds and the words we use, and not only our activities.
Like at week number three, where we tracked the "thank yous" we said and were received, and when I realized that I thank mostly people that I don't know.
Apparently I'm a compulsive thanker to waitresses and waiters, but I definitely don't thank enough the people who are close to me.
Over one year, the process of actively noticing and counting these types of actions became a ritual.
It actually changed ourselves.
We became much more in tune with ourselves, much more aware of our behaviors and our surroundings.
Over one year, Stefanie and I connected at a very deep level through our shared data diary, but we could do this only because we put ourselves in these numbers, adding the contexts of our very personal stories to them.
It was the only way to make them truly meaningful and representative of ourselves.
I am not asking you to start drawing your personal data, or to find a pen pal across the ocean.
But I'm asking you to consider data -- all kind of data -- as the beginning of the conversation and not the end.
Because data alone will never give us a solution.
And this is why data failed us so badly -- because we failed to include the right amount of context to represent reality -- a nuanced, complicated and intricate reality.
We kept looking at these two numbers, obsessing with them and pretending that our world could be reduced to a couple digits and a horse race, while the real stories, the ones that really mattered, were somewhere else.
What we missed looking at these stories only through models and algorithms is what I call "data humanism." In the Renaissance humanism, European intellectuals placed the human nature instead of God at the center of their view of the world.
I believe something similar needs to happen with the universe of data.
Now data are apparently treated like a God -- keeper of infallible truth for our present and our future.
The experiences that I shared with you today taught me that to make data faithfully representative of our human nature and to make sure they will not mislead us anymore, we need to start designing ways to include empathy, imperfection and human qualities in how we collect, process, analyze and display them.
I do see a place where, ultimately, instead of using data only to become more efficient, we will all use data to become more humane.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Laughter) about three seconds ago. I've been futuring for about 20 years, and when I first started, I would sit down with people, and say, "Hey, let's talk 10, 20 years out." And they'd say, "Great." And I've been seeing that time horizon get shorter and shorter and shorter, so much so that I met with a CEO two months ago and I said — we started our initial conversation. He goes, "I love what you do.
I want to talk about the next six months. "(Laughter)
We have a lot of problems that we are facing.
These are civilizational-scale problems. The issue though is, we can't solve them using the mental models that we use right now to try and solve these problems.
Yes, a lot of great technical work is being done, but there is a problem that we need to solve for a priori, before, if we want to really move the needle on those big problems. "Short-termism." Right?
There's no marches.
There's no bracelets.
There's no petitions that you can sign to be against short-termism.
I tried to put one up, and no one signed. It was weird.
(Laughter) But it prevents us from doing so much.
Short-termism, for many reasons, has pervaded every nook and cranny of our reality.
I just want you to take a second and just think about an issue that you're thinking, working on.
It could be personal, it could be at work or it could be move-the-needle world stuff, and think about how far out you tend to think about the solution set for that.
Because short-termism prevents the CEO from buying really expensive safety equipment.
It'll hurt the bottom line.
So we get the Deepwater Horizon.
Short-termism prevents teachers from spending quality one-on-one time with their students.
So right now in America, a high school student drops out every 26 seconds.
(Laughter) Short-termism prevents Congress -- sorry if there's anyone in here from Congress --
from putting money into a real infrastructure bill. So what we get is the I-35W bridge collapse over the Mississippi a few years ago, 13 killed.
It wasn't always like this.
We did the Panama Canal.
We pretty much have eradicated global polio.
We did the transcontinental railroad, the Marshall Plan.
And it's not just big, physical infrastructure problems and issues.
Women's suffrage, the right to vote.
But in our short-termist time, where everything seems to happen right now and we can only think out past the next tweet or timeline post, we get hyper-reactionary. So what do we do? We take people who are fleeing their war-torn country, and we go after them. We take low-level drug offenders, and we put them away for life.
And then we build McMansions without even thinking about how people are going to get between them and their job.
It's a quick buck.
Now, the reality is, for a lot of these problems, there are some technical fixes, a lot of them.
I call these technical fixes sandbag strategies.
So you know there's a storm coming, the levee is broken, no one's put any money into it, you surround your home with sandbags. And guess what? It works. Storm goes away, the water level goes down, you get rid of the sandbags, and you do this storm after storm after storm.
And here's the insidious thing. A sandbag strategy can get you reelected. A sandbag strategy can help you make your quarterly numbers.
Now, if we want to move forward into a different future than the one we have right now, because I don't think we've hit — 2016 is not peak civilization. (Laughter) There's some more we can do.
But my argument is that unless we shift our mental models and our mental maps on how we think about the short, it's not going to happen.
So what I've developed is something called "longpath," and it's a practice.
And longpath isn't a kind of one-and-done exercise.
I'm sure everyone here at some point has done an off-site with a lot of Post-It notes and whiteboards, and you do — no offense to the consultants in here who do that — and you do a long-term plan, and then two weeks later, everyone forgets about it. Right? Or a week later.
If you're lucky, three months.
It's a practice because it's not necessarily a thing that you do.
It's a process where you have to revisit different ways of thinking for every major decision that you're working on.
So I want to go through those three ways of thinking.
So the first: transgenerational thinking.
I love the philosophers: Plato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.
I was raised on them.
But they all did one thing that didn't actually seem like a big deal until I really started kind of looking into this.
And they all took, as a unit of measure for their entire reality of what it meant to be virtuous and good, the single lifespan, from birth to death.
But here's a problem with these issues: they stack up on top of us, because the only way we know how to do something good in the world is if we do it between our birth and our death.
That's what we're programmed to do.
If you go to the self-help section in any bookstore, it's all about you.
Which is great, unless you're dealing with some of these major issues.
And so with transgenerational thinking, which is really kind of transgenerational ethics, you're able to expand how you think about these problems, what is your role in helping to solve them.
Now, this isn't something that just has to be done at the Security Council chamber.
It's something that you can do in a very kind of personal way.
So every once in a while, if I'm lucky, my wife and I like to go out to dinner, and we have three children under the age of seven.
So you can imagine it's a very peaceful, quiet meal. (Laughter) So we sit down and literally all I want to do is just eat and chill, and my kids have a completely and totally different idea of what we're going to be doing.
And so my first idea is my sandbag strategy, right?
It's to go into my pocket and take out the iPhone and give them "Frozen" or some other bestselling game thing.
And then I stop and I have to kind of put on this transgenerational thinking cap.
I don't do this in the restaurant, because it would be bizarre, but I have to — I did it once, and that's how I learned it was bizarre. (Laughter)
And you have to kind of think, "OK, I can do this." But what is this teaching them?
So what does it mean if I actually bring some paper or engage with them in conversation? It's hard. It's not easy, and I'm making this very personal.
It's actually more traumatic than some of the big issues that I work on in the world -- entertaining my kids at dinner.
But what it does is it connects them here in the present with me, but it also -- and this is the crux of transgenerational thinking ethics -- it sets them up to how they're going to interact with their kids and their kids and their kids.
Second, futures thinking. When we think about the future, 10, 15 years out, give me a vision of what the future is.
You don't have to give it to me, but think in your head.
And what you're probably going to see is the dominant cultural lens that dominates our thinking about the future right now: technology.
So when we think about the problems, we always put it through a technological lens, a tech-centric, a techno-utopia, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it's something that we have to really think deeply about if we're going to move on these major issues, because it wasn't always like this. Right? The ancients had their way of thinking about what the future was.
The Church definitely had their idea of what the future could be, and you could actually pay your way into that future. Right? And luckily for humanity, we got the scientific revolution.
From there, we got the technology, but what has happened — And by the way, this is not a critique. I love technology. Everything in my house talks back to me, from my children to my speakers to everything.
(Laughter)
But we've abdicated the future from the high priests in Rome to the high priests of Silicon Valley.
So when we think, well, how are we going to deal with climate or with poverty or homelessness, our first reaction is to think about it through a technology lens.
And look, I'm not advocating that we go to this guy.
I love Joel, don't get me wrong, but I'm not saying we go to Joel.
What I'm saying is we have to rethink our base assumption about only looking at the future in one way, only looking at it through the dominant lens.
Because our problems are so big and so vast that we need to open ourselves up.
So that's why I do everything in my power not to talk about the future.
I talk about futures.
It opens the conversation again.
So when you're sitting and thinking about how do we move forward on this major issue -- it could be at home, it could be at work, it could be again on the global stage -- don't cut yourself off from thinking about something beyond technology as a fix because we're more concerned about technological evolution right now than we are about moral evolution.
And unless we fix for that, we're not going to be able to get out of short-termism and get to where we want to be.
The final, telos thinking. This comes from the Greek root.
Ultimate aim and ultimate purpose.
And it's really asking one question: to what end?
When was the last time you asked yourself: To what end?
And when you asked yourself that, how far out did you go?
Because long isn't long enough anymore.
Three, five years doesn't cut it.
It's 30, 40, 50, 100 years.
In Homer's epic, "The Odyssey," Odysseus had the answer to his "what end." It was Ithaca.
It was this bold vision of what he wanted -- to return to Penelope.
And I can tell you, because of the work that I'm doing, but also you know it intuitively -- we have lost our Ithaca.
We have lost our "to what end," so we stay on this hamster wheel.
And yes, we're trying to solve these problems, but what comes after we solve the problem?
And unless you define what comes after, people aren't going to move.
The businesses -- this isn't just about business -- but the businesses that do consistently, who break out of short-termism not surprisingly are family-run businesses. They're transgenerational. They're telos. They think about the futures.
And this is an ad for Patek Philippe.
They're 175 years old, and what's amazing is that they literally embody this kind of longpathian sense in their brand, because, by the way, you never actually own a Patek Philippe, and I definitely won't —
(Laughter)
unless somebody wants to just throw 25,000 dollars on the stage.
You merely look after it for the next generation.
So it's important that we remember, the future, we treat it like a noun. It's not. It's a verb. It requires action. It requires us to push into it.
It's not this thing that washes over us.
It's something that we actually have total control over.
But in a short-term society, we end up feeling like we don't. We feel like we're trapped.
We can push through that.
Now I'm getting more comfortable in the fact that at some point in the inevitable future, I will die.
But because of these new ways of thinking and doing, both in the outside world and also with my family at home, and what I'm leaving my kids, I get more comfortable in that fact.
And it's something that a lot of us are really uncomfortable with, but I'm telling you, think it through.
Apply this type of thinking and you can push yourself past what's inevitably very, very uncomfortable.
And it all begins really with yourself asking this question: What is your longpath?
But I ask you, when you ask yourself that now or tonight or behind a steering wheel or in the boardroom or the situation room: push past the longpath, quick, oh, what's my longpath the next three years or five years?
Try and push past your own life if you can because it makes you do things a little bit bigger than you thought were possible.
Yes, we have huge, huge problems out there.
With this process, with this thinking, I think we can make a difference.
I think you can make a difference, and I believe in you guys.
Thank you. (Applause)
Last year, I got a chance to watch the new "Star Wars" movie, which was fantastic, but one thing kept bugging me.
I don't know if you noticed this or not.
In this entirely technically advanced world, I did not see a single AED anywhere, which was totally shocking -- almost as shocking as not knowing what an AED is, which you guys do know.
But for those at home, an AED is an automated external defibrillator.
It's the device you use when your heart goes into cardiac arrest to shock it back into a normal rhythm, or, as one of the guys I was teaching a class to referred to it as: "The shocky-hearty-box thing."
(Laughter)
But I really can't blame the Empire, since health and safety regulations aren't really their first order of business.
Though, even if we -- I think worse than not having an AED would be if there was one there, but just, no one knew where to find it.
These devices can drastically increase your chance of survival -- almost like a tauntaun on Hoth.
(Laughter)
But I'm pretty sure that stormtrooper is going to be toast, regardless if we have an AED or not, since what happens is the chest plate is going to be quite hard to get off, and like that tauntaun, the AED has a very short window of time at which it's highly effective.
In this case -- basically, we've got to use it within the first 10 minutes.
The Jedi, on the other hand, have no problems with their outfits.
Those robes open straight up, you can place the pads right onto the chest -- so upper-right-hand side of the chest, lower left, wait for the unit to determine if it's a shockable rhythm and get ready to shock.
But, the Jedi do have a problem.
They have a head appendage issue.
And so I can be totally clear, thinking I'm ready to go, but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle and inadvertently shocking myself.
(Laughter)
So before you hit that button, make sure you are clear and everyone else is clear.
Going back to that stormtrooper: If I did get that chest plate off in time, what would you do if you suddenly found there was a Wookiee under there, or possibly two Ewoks?
(Laughter)
Well, lucky for us, in the kit there's actually a razor, and we can use that to shave the chest on the upper right-hand side and the lower left.
Wookiees also have another problem. They have an accessory issue.
What we want to do is remove these -- anything between the two pads we want to remove, since it can cause something called "arcing." For those who don't know what arcing is, do you remember the Emperor, when he shoots electricity out the ends of his fingers --
(Laughter)
that would be kind of like arcing. Another thing that -- Oh! By the way, he creates that by wearing wool socks under his robes.
(Laughter)
We can also get arcing if we have an extremely wet chest.
The electricity travels across the surface instead of through the heart.
We can correct this with the immortal words of Douglas Adams: "Don't panic," which most of us have done today -- and also always having a towel.
So, good words to go by.
The metal bikini -- unfortunately, this is where panic sets in -- like the modern bra, we have to make sure we remove, because this can cause severe arcing along with burns.
But unfortunately this opens up an issue that's almost as controversial as talking about the prequels.
(Laughter)
The mere mention of the word "nipples," and people get into a little bit of a tizzy.
By the way, that is not a nipple, that's a cupcake.
(Laughter)
Chances are, if you do have to use this, this is going to be on someone you know.
And remember, everyone has nipples, except for Jabba.
(Laughter)
But he does love cupcakes.
Speaking about Jabba, if we do have to use an AED on him, remember pad placement is the same, even though he doesn't have nipples.
So it's going to be upper right-hand side, lower left.
If we were going through, we're shocking, getting ready to go -- after we've done the shock, one of the things we need to do is remember to do compression.
The preferred method is 30 compressions and two breaths in the center of the chest, between the nipples, pressing down at least two inches, no more than two and a half, at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute, no more than 120.
Unfortunately, due to the size of Jabba's mouth and also what he puts in said mouth, we may not want to actually do the mouth-to-mouth part.
So instead, we can do compression-only CPR.
The way of remembering the compression-only part is we can actually use the Imperial March.
I would sing it for you --
(Laughter)
Unfortunately, that would be more something an interrogation droid would do.
Yoda. Small little guy, like a baby.
What we do is basically treat him like a baby, in the sense that we're going to place one pad in the center of the chest and one in the back.
If we place them both in the front, they can be too close and cause severe arcing, so we want to avoid that.
Hopefully, this helped to clarify and put some light on some of the darker issues of using an AED in the Star Wars universe, or any universe in total.
I'll leave you with one point. Remember, if you do find yourself dealing with a Wookiee, do not shave the entire Wookiee.
This takes way too much time, and it only pisses them off.
(Laughter)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Twenty years ago, when I was a barrister and human rights lawyer in full-time legal practice in London, and the highest court in the land still convened, some would say by an accident of history, in this building here, I met a young man who had just quit his job in the British Foreign Office.
When I asked him, "Why did you leave," he told me this story.
He had gone to his boss one morning and said, "Let's do something about human rights abuses in China." And his boss had replied, "We can't do anything about human rights abuses in China because we have trade relations with China."
So my friend went away with his tail between his legs, and six months later, he returned again to his boss, and he said this time, "Let's do something about human rights in Burma," as it was then called.
His boss once again paused and said, "Oh, but we can't do anything about human rights in Burma because we don't have any trade relations with Burma." (Laughter)
It wasn't just the hypocrisy that got to him. It was the unwillingness of his government to engage in conflict with other governments, in tense discussions, all the while, innocent people were being harmed.
We are constantly told that conflict is bad that compromise is good; that conflict is bad but consensus is good; that conflict is bad and collaboration is good.
But in my view, that's far too simple a vision of the world.
We cannot know whether conflict is bad unless we know who is fighting, why they are fighting and how they are fighting.
And compromises can be thoroughly rotten if they harm people who are not at the table, people who are vulnerable, disempowered, people whom we have an obligation to protect.
Now, you might be somewhat skeptical of a lawyer arguing about the benefits of conflict and creating problems for compromise, but I did also qualify as a mediator, and these days, I spend my time giving talks about ethics for free.
So as my bank manager likes to remind me, I'm downwardly mobile.
But if you accept my argument, it should change not just the way we lead our personal lives, which I wish to put to one side for the moment, but it will change the way we think about major problems of public health and the environment. Let me explain. Every middle schooler in the United States, my 12-year-old daughter included, learns that there are three branches of government, the legislative, the executive and the judicial branch.
James Madison wrote, "If there is any principle more sacred in our Constitution, and indeed in any free constitution, than any other, it is that which separates the legislative, the executive and the judicial powers." Now, the framers were not just concerned about the concentration and exercise of power. They also understood the perils of influence.
Judges cannot determine the constitutionality of laws if they participate in making those laws, nor can they hold the other branches of government accountable if they collaborate with them or enter into close relationships with them.
The Constitution is, as one famous scholar put it, "an invitation to struggle." And we the people are served when those branches do, indeed, struggle with each other.
Now, we recognize the importance of struggle not just in the public sector between our branches of government.
We also know it too in the private sector, in relationships among corporations.
Let's imagine that two American airlines get together and agree that they will not drop the price of their economy class airfares below 250 dollars a ticket.
That is collaboration, some would say collusion, not competition, and we the people are harmed because we pay more for our tickets.
and we the people are harmed Imagine similarly two airlines were to say, "Look, Airline A, we'll take the route from LA to Chicago," and Airline B says, "We'll take the route from Chicago to DC, and we won't compete." Once again, that's collaboration or collusion instead of competition,
So we understand the importance of struggle when it comes to relationships between branches of government, the public sector.
We also understand the importance of conflict when it comes to relationships among corporations, the private sector.
But where we have forgotten it is in the relationships between the public and the private.
And governments all over the world are collaborating with industry to solve problems of public health and the environment, often collaborating with the very corporations that are creating or exacerbating the problems they are trying to solve.
We are told that these relationships are a win-win.
But what if someone is losing out?
Let me give you some examples.
A United Nations agency decided to address a serious problem: poor sanitation in schools in rural India.
They did so not just in collaboration with national and local governments but also with a television company and with a major multinational soda company.
In exchange for less than one million dollars, that corporation received the benefits of a months-long promotional campaign including a 12-hour telethon all using the company's logo and color scheme.
This was an arrangement which was totally understandable from the corporation's point of view.
It enhances the reputation of the company and it creates brand loyalty for its products.
But in my view, this is profoundly problematic for the intergovernmental agency, an agency that has a mission to promote sustainable living.
By increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages made from scarce local water supplies and drunk out of plastic bottles in a country that is already grappling with obesity, this is neither sustainable from a public health nor an environmental point of view.
And in order to solve one public health problem, the agency is sowing the seeds of another.
This is just one example of dozens I discovered in researching a book on the relationships between government and industry.
I could also have told you about the initiatives in parks in London and throughout Britain, involving the same company, promoting exercise, or indeed of the British government creating voluntary pledges in partnership with industry instead of regulating industry.
These collaborations or partnerships have become the paradigm in public health, and once again, they make sense from the point of view of industry.
It allows them to frame public health problems and their solutions in ways that are least threatening to, most consonant with their commercial interests.
So obesity becomes a problem of individual decision-making, of personal behavior, personal responsibility and lack of physical activity.
It is not a problem, when framed this way, of a multinational food system involving major corporations.
And again, I don't blame industry.
Industry naturally engages in strategies of influence to promote its commercial interests.
But governments have a responsibility to develop counterstrategies to protect us and the common good.
The mistake that governments are making when they collaborate in this way with industry is that they conflate the common good with common ground.
When you collaborate with industry, you necessarily put off the table things that might promote the common good to which industry will not agree.
Industry will not agree to increased regulation unless it believes this will stave off even more regulation or perhaps knock some competitors out of the market.
Nor can companies agree to do certain things, for example raise the prices of their unhealthy products, because that would violate competition law, as we've established.
So our governments should not confound the common good and common ground, especially when common ground means reaching agreement with industry.
I want to give you another example, moving from high-profile collaboration to something that is below ground both literally and figuratively: the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas.
Imagine that you purchase a plot of land not knowing the mineral rights have been sold.
This is before the fracking boom.
You build your dream home on that plot, and shortly afterwards, you discover that a gas company is building a well pad on your land.
That was the plight of the Hallowich family.
Within a very short period of time, they began to complain of headaches, of sore throats, of itchy eyes, in addition to the interference of the noise, vibration and the bright lights from the flaring of natural gas.
They were very vocal in their criticisms, and then they fell silent.
And thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, where this image appeared, and one other newspaper, we discovered why they fell silent.
The newspapers went to the court and said, "What happened to the Hallowiches?" And it turned out the Hallowiches had made a secret settlement with the gas operators, and it was a take-it-or-leave-it settlement.
The gas company said, you can have a six-figure sum to move elsewhere and start your lives again, but in return you must promise not to speak of your experience with our company, not to speak of your experience with fracking, not to speak about the health consequences that might have been revealed by a medical examination. Now, I do not blame the Hallowiches for accepting a take-it-or-leave-it settlement and starting their lives elsewhere.
And one can understand why the company would wish to silence a squeaky wheel.
What I want to point the finger at is the legal and regulatory system, a system in which there are networks of agreements just like this one which serve to silence people and seal off data points from public health experts and epidemiologists, a system in which regulators will even refrain from issuing a violation notice in the event of pollution if the landowner and the gas company agree to settle.
This is a system which isn't just bad from a public health point of view; it exposes hazards to local families who remain in the dark.
Now, I have given you two examples not because they are isolated examples.
They are examples of a systemic problem.
I could share some counterexamples, the case for example of the public official who sues the pharmaceutical company for concealing the fact that its antidepressant increases suicidal thoughts in adolescents.
I can tell you about the regulator who went after the food company for exaggerating the purported health benefits of its yogurt.
And I can tell you about the legislator who despite heavy lobbying directed at both sides of the aisle pushes for environmental protections.
These are isolated examples, but they are beacons of light in the darkness, and they can show us the way.
I began by suggesting that sometimes we need to engage in conflict.
Governments should tussle with, struggle with, at times engage in direct conflict with corporations.
This is not because governments are inherently good and corporations are inherently evil. Each is capable of good or ill.
But corporations understandably act to promote their commercial interests, and they do so either sometimes undermining or promoting the common good.
But it is the responsibility of governments to protect and promote the common good.
And we should insist that they fight to do so.
This is because governments are the guardians of public health; governments are the guardians of the environment; and it is governments that are guardians of these essential parts of our common good.
Thank you. (Applause)
In the next six minutes that you will listen to me, the world will have lost three mothers while delivering their babies: one, because of a severe complication; second, because she will be a teenager and her body will not be prepared for birth; but the third, only because of lack of access to basic clean tools at the time of childbirth.
She will not be alone.
Over one million mothers and babies die every single year in the developing world, only because of lack of access to basic cleanliness while giving birth to their babies.
My journey began on a hot summer afternoon in India in 2008, when after a day of meeting women and listening to their needs, I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.
As a mother, I was very curious on how she delivered babies in her house.
After a deep and engaging conversation with her on how she considered it a profound calling to do what she was doing, I asked her a parting question: Do you have the tools that you need to deliver the babies?
I got to see her tool. "This is what I use to separate the mother and the baby," she said.
Unsure of how to react, I held this agricultural tool in my hand in shock.
I took a picture of this, hugged her and walked away.
My mind was flooded with reflections of my own infection that I had to struggle with for a year past childbirth despite having access to the best medical care, and memories of my conversation with my father, who had lost his mom to childbirth, on how he thought his life would be so different if she would have been just next to him growing up.
As a product developer, I started my process of research.
I was very excited to find that there was a product out there called the Clean Birth Kit.
But I just couldn't buy one for months.
They were only assembled based on availability of funding.
Finally, when I got my hands on one, I was in shock again.
I would never use these tools to deliver my baby, I thought. But to confirm my instincts, I went back to the women, some of whom had the experience of using this product.
Lo and behold, they had the same reaction and more.
The women said they would rather deliver on a floor than on a plastic sheet that smeared blood all over.
They were absolutely right -- it would cause more infection.
The thread provided was a highway to bacterial infection through the baby's umbilical cord, and the blade used was the kind that men used for shaving, and they did not want it anywhere close to them.
There was no incentive for anybody to redesign this product, because it was based on charity.
The women were never consulted in this process.
And to my surprise, the need was not only in homes but also in institutional settings with high-volume births.
Situations in remote areas were even more daunting.
This had to change. I made this my area of focus.
I started the design process by collecting feedback, developing prototypes and engaging with various stakeholders researching global protocols.
With every single prototype, we went back to the women to ensure that we had a product for them.
What I learned through this process was that these women, despite their extreme poverty, placed great value on their health and well-being.
They were absolutely not poor in mind.
As with all of us, they would appreciate a well-designed product developed for their needs.
After many iterations working with experts, medical health professionals and the women themselves, I should say it was not an easy process at all, but we had a simple and beautiful design.
For a dollar more than what the existing product was offered for, at three dollars, we were able to deliver "janma," a clean birth kit in a purse.
Janma, meaning "birth," contained a blood-absorbing sheet for the woman to give birth on, a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp, a bar of soap, a pair of gloves and the first cloth to wipe the baby clean.
All this came packaged in a beautiful purse that was given to the mother as a gift after all her hard work, that she carried home with pride as a symbol of prosperity.
One woman reacted to this gift.
She said, "Is this really mine?
Can I keep it? "The other one said," Will you give me a different color when I have my next baby? "
(Laughter) Better yet, a woman expressed that this was the first purse that she had ever owned in her life.
The kit, aside from its symbolism and its simplicity, is designed to follow globally recommended medical protocol and serves as a behavior-change tool to follow steps one after the other.
It can not only be used in homes, but also in institutional settings.
To date, our kit has impacted over 600,000 mothers and babies around the world.
It's a humbling experience to watch these numbers grow, and I cannot wait until we reach a hundred million.
But women's health issues do not end here.
There are thousands of simple issues that require low-cost interventions.
We have facts to prove that if we invest in women and girls and provide them with better health and well-being, they will deliver healthier and wealthier and prosperous communities.
We have to start by bringing simplicity and dignity to women's health issues: from reducing maternal mortality, to breaking taboos, to empowering women to take control of their own lives.
This is my dream.
But it is not possible to achieve it without engaging men and women alike from around the world — yes, all of you.
I recently heard this lyric by Leonard Cohen: "Ring the bells that still can ring.
Forget your perfect offering. There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in." This is my bit of light.
But we need more light.
In fact, we need huge spotlights placed in the world of women's health if we need a better tomorrow.
We should never forget that women are at the center of a sustainable world, and we do not exist without them.
Thank you. (Applause)
So I would like to start by telling you about one of my greatest friends, Okoloma Maduewesi.
Okoloma lived on my street and looked after me like a big brother.
If I liked a boy, I would ask Okoloma's opinion.
Okoloma died in the notorious Sosoliso plane crash in Nigeria in December of 2005.
Almost exactly seven years ago.
Okoloma was a person I could argue with, laugh with and truly talk to.
He was also the first person to call me a feminist.
I was about fourteen, we were at his house, arguing.
Both of us bristling with half bit knowledge from books that we had read.
I don't remember what this particular argument was about, but I remember that as I argued and argued, Okoloma looked at me and said, "You know, you're a feminist." It was not a compliment.
(Laughter)
I could tell from his tone, the same tone that you would use to say something like, "You're a supporter of terrorism."
(Laughter)
I did not know exactly what this word "feminist" meant, and I did not want Okoloma to know that I did not know.
So I brushed it aside, and I continued to argue.
And the first thing I planned to do when I got home was to look up the word "feminist" in the dictionary.
Now fast forward to some years later, I wrote a novel about a man who among other things beats his wife and whose story doesn't end very well.
While I was promoting the novel in Nigeria, a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man, told me he wanted to advise me.
And for the Nigerians here, I'm sure we're all familiar with how quick our people are to give unsolicited advice.
He told me that people were saying that my novel was feminist and his advice to me -- and he was shaking his head sadly as he spoke -- was that I should never call myself a feminist because feminists are women who are unhappy because they cannot find husbands.
(Laughter)
So I decided to call myself "a happy feminist." Then an academic, a Nigerian woman told me that feminism was not our culture and that feminism wasn't African, and that I was calling myself a feminist because I had been corrupted by "Western books." Which amused me, because a lot of my early readings were decidedly unfeminist.
I think I must have read every single Mills &amp; Boon romance published before I was sixteen.
And each time I tried to read those books called "the feminist classics," I'd get bored, and I really struggled to finish them.
But anyway, since feminism was un-African, I decided that I would now call myself "a happy African feminist." At some point I was a happy African feminist who does not hate men and who likes lip gloss and who wears high heels for herself but not for men.
(Laughter)
Of course a lot of this was tongue-in-cheek, but that word feminist is so heavy with baggage, negative baggage.
You hate men, you hate bras, you hate African culture, that sort of thing.
Now here's a story from my childhood.
When I was in primary school, my teacher said at the beginning of term that she would give the class a test and whoever got the highest score would be the class monitor.
Now, class monitor was a big deal.
If you were a class monitor, you got to write down the names of noisemakers --
(Laughter)
which was having enough power of its own.
But my teacher would also give you a cane to hold in your hand while you walk around and patrol the class for noisemakers.
Now, of course you were not actually allowed to use the cane.
But it was an exciting prospect for the nine-year-old me.
I very much wanted to be the class monitor.
And I got the highest score on the test.
Then, to my surprise, my teacher said that the monitor had to be a boy.
She had forgotten to make that clear earlier because she assumed it was ... obvious.
(Laughter)
A boy had the second highest score on the test, and he would be monitor.
Now, what was even more interesting about this is that the boy was a sweet, gentle soul who had no interest in patrolling the class with the cane, while I was full of ambition to do so.
But I was female and he was male, and so he became the class monitor.
And I've never forgotten that incident.
I often make the mistake of thinking that something that is obvious to me is just as obvious to everyone else.
Now, take my dear friend Louis for example.
Louis is a brilliant, progressive man, and we would have conversations and he would tell me, "I don't know what you mean by things being different or harder for women.
Maybe in the past, but not now." And I didn't understand how Louis could not see what seems so self-evident.
Then one evening, in Lagos, Louis and I went out with friends.
And for people here who are not familiar with Lagos, there's that wonderful Lagos' fixture, the sprinkling of energetic men who hang around outside establishments and very dramatically "help" you park your car.
I was impressed with the particular theatrics of the man who found us a parking spot that evening.
And so as we were leaving, I decided to leave him a tip.
I opened my bag, put my hand inside my bag, brought out my money that I had earned from doing my work, and I gave it to the man.
And he, this man who was very grateful and very happy, took the money from me, looked across at Louis and said, "Thank you, sir!"
(Laughter)
Louis looked at me, surprised, and asked, "Why is he thanking me?
I didn't give him the money. "Then I saw realization dawn on Louis' face.
The man believed that whatever money I had had ultimately come from Louis.
Because Louis is a man.
Men and women are different.
We have different hormones, we have different sexual organs, we have different biological abilities.
Women can have babies, men can't.
At least not yet.
(Laughter)
Men have testosterone and are in general physically stronger than women.
There's slightly more women than men in the world, about 52 percent of the world's population is female.
But most of the positions of power and prestige are occupied by men.
The late Kenyan Nobel Peace laureate, Wangari Maathai, put it simply and well when she said: "The higher you go, the fewer women there are." In the recent US elections we kept hearing of the Lilly Ledbetter law, and if we go beyond the nicely alliterative name of that law, it was really about a man and a woman doing the same job, being equally qualified, and the man being paid more because he's a man.
So in the literal way, men rule the world, and this made sense a thousand years ago because human beings lived then in a world in which physical strength was the most important attribute for survival.
The physically stronger person was more likely to lead, and men, in general, are physically stronger.
Of course there are many exceptions.
(Laughter)
But today we live in a vastly different world.
The person more likely to lead is not the physically stronger person; it is the more creative person, the more intelligent person, the more innovative person, and there are no hormones for those attributes.
A man is as likely as a woman to be intelligent, to be creative, to be innovative.
We have evolved; but it seems to me that our ideas of gender had not evolved.
Some weeks ago, I walked into a lobby of one of the best Nigerian hotels.
I thought about naming the hotel, but I thought I probably shouldn't.
And a guard at the entrance stopped me and asked me annoying questions, because their automatic assumption is that a Nigerian female walking into a hotel alone is a sex worker.
And by the way, why do these hotels focus on the ostensible supply rather than the demand for sex workers?
In Lagos I cannot go alone into many "reputable" bars and clubs.
They just don't let you in if you're a woman alone, you have to be accompanied by a man.
Each time I walk into a Nigerian restaurant with a man, the waiter greets the man and ignores me.
The waiters are products --
(Laughter)
At this some women felt like, "Yes! I thought that!" The waiters are products of a society that has taught them that men are more important than women.
And I know that waiters don't intend any harm.
But it's one thing to know intellectually and quite another to feel it emotionally.
Each time they ignore me, I feel invisible. I feel upset. I want to tell them that I am just as human as the man, that I'm just as worthy of acknowledgment.
These are little things, but sometimes it's the little things that sting the most.
And not long ago, I wrote an article about what it means to be young and female in Lagos, and the printers told me, "It was so angry." Of course it was angry!
(Laughter)
I am angry. Gender as it functions today is a grave injustice.
We should all be angry.
Anger has a long history of bringing about positive change; but, in addition to being angry, I'm also hopeful.
Because I believe deeply in the ability of human beings to make and remake themselves for the better.
Gender matters everywhere in the world, but I want to focus on Nigeria and on Africa in general, because it is where I know, and because it is where my heart is.
And I would like today to ask that we begin to dream about and plan for a different world, a fairer world, a world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves.
And this is how to start: we must raise our daughters differently.
We must also raise our sons differently.
We do a great disservice to boys on how we raise them; we stifle the humanity of boys.
We define masculinity in a very narrow way, masculinity becomes this hard, small cage and we put boys inside the cage.
We teach boys to be afraid of fear.
We teach boys to be afraid of weakness, of vulnerability.
We teach them to mask their true selves, because they have to be, in Nigerian speak, "hard man!" In secondary school, a boy and a girl, both of them teenagers, both of them with the same amount of pocket money, would go out and then the boy would be expected always to pay, to prove his masculinity.
And yet we wonder why boys are more likely to steal money from their parents.
What if both boys and girls were raised not to link masculinity with money?
What if the attitude was not "the boy has to pay" but rather "whoever has more should pay?" Now, of course because of that historical advantage, it is mostly men who will have more today, but if we start raising children differently, then in fifty years, in a hundred years, boys will no longer have the pressure of having to prove this masculinity.
But by far the worst thing we do to males, by making them feel that they have to be hard, is that we leave them with very fragile egos.
The more "hard man" the man feels compelled to be, the weaker his ego is.
And then we do a much greater disservice to girls because we raise them to cater to the fragile egos of men.
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller, we say to girls, "You can have ambition, but not too much."
(Laughter)
"You should aim to be successful, but not too successful, otherwise you would threaten the man." If you are the breadwinner in your relationship with a man, you have to pretend that you're not, especially in public, otherwise you will emasculate him.
But what if we question the premise itself?
Why should a woman's success be a threat to a man?
What if we decide to simply dispose of that word, and I don't think there's an English word I dislike more than "emasculation." A Nigerian acquaintance once asked me if I was worried that men would be intimidated by me.
I was not worried at all.
In fact, it had not occurred to me to be worried because a man who would be intimidated by me is exactly the kind of man I would have no interest in.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But still I was really struck by this.
Because I'm female, I'm expected to aspire to marriage; I'm expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important.
A marriage can be a good thing; it can be a source of joy and love and mutual support.
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same?
I know a woman who decided to sell her house because she didn't want to intimidate a man who might marry her.
I know an unmarried woman in Nigeria who, when she goes to conferences, wears a wedding ring because according to her, she wants the other participants in the conference to "give her respect." I know young women who are under so much pressure from family, from friends, even from work to get married, and they're pushed to make terrible choices.
A woman at a certain age who is unmarried, our society teaches her to see it as a deep, personal failure.
And a man at a certain age who is unmarried, we just think he hasn't come around to making his pick.
(Laughter)
It's easy for us to say, "Oh, but women can just say no to all of this." But the reality is more difficult and more complex.
We're all social beings.
We internalize ideas from our socialization.
Even the language we use in talking about marriage and relationships illustrates this.
The language of marriage is often the language of ownership rather than the language of partnership.
We use the word "respect" to mean something a woman shows a man but often not something a man shows a woman.
Both men and women in Nigeria will say -- this is an expression I'm very amused by -- "I did it for peace in my marriage." Now, when men say it, it is usually about something that they should not be doing anyway.
(Laughter)
Sometimes they say it to their friends, it's something to say to their friends in a kind of fondly exasperated way, you know, something that ultimately proves how masculine they are, how needed, how loved. "Oh, my wife said I can't go to the club every night, so for peace in my marriage, I do it only on weekends."
(Laughter)
Now, when a woman says, "I did it for peace in my marriage," she's usually talking about giving up a job, a dream, a career.
We teach females that in relationships, compromise is what women do.
We raise girls to see each other as competitors -- not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing, but for attention of men.
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are.
If we have sons, we don't mind knowing about our sons' girlfriends.
But our daughters' boyfriends? God forbid.
(Laughter)
But of course when the time is right, we expect those girls to bring back the perfect man to be their husbands.
We police girls, we praise girls for virginity, but we don't praise boys for virginity, and it's always made me wonder how exactly this is supposed to work out because ...
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I mean, the loss of virginity is usually a process that involves ...
Recently a young woman was gang raped in a university in Nigeria, I think some of us know about that.
And the response of many young Nigerians, both male and female, was something along the lines of this: "Yes, rape is wrong.
But what is a girl doing in a room with four boys?" Now, if we can forget the horrible inhumanity of that response, these Nigerians have been raised to think of women as inherently guilty, and they have been raised to expect so little of men that the idea of men as savage beings without any control is somehow acceptable.
We teach girls shame. "Close your legs." "Cover yourself." We make them feel as though by being born female they're already guilty of something.
And so, girls grow up to be women who cannot see they have desire.
They grow up to be women who silence themselves.
They grow up to be women who cannot say what they truly think, and they grow up -- and this is the worst thing we did to girls -- they grow up to be women who have turned pretense into an art form.
(Applause)
I know a woman who hates domestic work, she just hates it, but she pretends that she likes it, because she's been taught that to be "good wife material" she has to be -- to use that Nigerian word -- very "homely." And then she got married, and after a while her husband's family began to complain that she had changed.
(Laughter)
Actually, she had not changed, she just got tired of pretending.
The problem with gender, is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are.
Now imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves, if we didn't have the weight of gender expectations.
Boys and girls are undeniably different biologically, but socialization exaggerates the differences and then it becomes a self-fulfilling process.
Now, take cooking for example.
Today women in general are more likely to do the housework than men, the cooking and cleaning. But why is that? Is it because women are born with a cooking gene?
(Laughter)
Or because over years they have been socialized to see cooking as their role?
Actually, I was going to say that maybe women are born with a cooking gene, until I remember that the majority of the famous cooks in the world, whom we give the fancy title of "chefs," are men.
I used to look up to my grandmother who was a brilliant, brilliant woman, and wonder how she would have been if she had the same opportunities as men when she was growing up.
Now today, there are many more opportunities for women than there were during my grandmother's time because of changes in policy, changes in law, all of which are very important.
But what matters even more is our attitude, our mindset, what we believe and what we value about gender.
What if in raising children we focus on ability instead of gender?
What if in raising children we focus on interest instead of gender?
I know a family who have a son and a daughter, both of whom are brilliant at school, who are wonderful, lovely children.
When the boy is hungry, the parents say to the girl, "Go and cook Indomie noodles for your brother."
(Laughter)
Now, the daughter doesn't particularly like to cook Indomie noodles, but she's a girl, and so she has to.
Now, what if the parents, from the beginning, taught both the boy and the girl to cook Indomie?
Cooking, by the way, is a very useful skill for boys to have.
I've never thought it made sense to leave such a crucial thing, the ability to nourish oneself --
(Laughter)
in the hands of others.
I know a woman who has the same degree and the same job as her husband.
When they get back from work, she does most of the housework, which I think is true for many marriages.
But what struck me about them was that whenever her husband changed the baby's diaper, she said "thank you" to him.
Now, what if she saw this as perfectly normal and natural that he should, in fact, care for his child?
(Laughter)
I'm trying to unlearn many of the lessons of gender that I internalized when I was growing up.
But I sometimes still feel very vulnerable in the face of gender expectations.
The first time I taught a writing class in graduate school, I was worried.
I wasn't worried about the material I would teach because I was well-prepared, and I was going to teach what I enjoy teaching.
Instead, I was worried about what to wear.
I wanted to be taken seriously.
I knew that because I was female I will automatically have to prove my worth.
And I was worried that if I looked too feminine, I would not be taken seriously.
I really wanted to wear my shiny lip gloss and my girly skirt, but I decided not to.
Instead, I wore a very serious, very manly and very ugly suit.
(Laughter)
Because the sad truth is that when it comes to appearance we start off with men as the standard, as the norm.
If a man is getting ready for a business meeting, he doesn't worry about looking too masculine and therefore not being taken for granted.
If a woman has to get ready for business meeting, she has to worry about looking too feminine and what it says and whether or not she will be taken seriously.
I wish I had not worn that ugly suit that day.
I've actually banished it from my closet, by the way.
Had I then the confidence that I have now to be myself, my students would have benefited even more from my teaching, because I would have been more comfortable and more fully and more truly myself.
I have chosen to no longer be apologetic for my femaleness and for my femininity.
(Applause)
And I want to be respected in all of my femaleness because I deserve to be.
Gender is not an easy conversation to have.
For both men and women, to bring up gender is sometimes to encounter almost immediate resistance.
I can imagine some people here are actually thinking, "Women too do sef." Some of the men here might be thinking, "OK, all of this is interesting, but I don't think like that." And that is part of the problem.
That many men do not actively think about gender or notice gender is part of the problem of gender.
That many men, say, like my friend Louis, that everything is fine now.
And that many men do nothing to change it.
If you are a man and you walk into a restaurant with a woman and the waiter greets only you, does it occur to you to ask the waiter, "Why haven't you greeted her?" Because gender can be --
(Laughter)
Actually, we may repose part of a longer version of this talk.
So, because gender can be a very uncomfortable conversation to have, there are very easy ways to close it, to close the conversation.
So some people will bring up evolutionary biology and apes, how, you know, female apes bow down to male apes and that sort of thing.
But the point is we're not apes.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Apes also live on trees and have earthworms for breakfast, and we don't.
Some people will say, "Well, poor men also have a hard time." And this is true.
But that is not what this --
(Laughter)
But this is not what this conversation is about.
Gender and class are different forms of oppression.
I actually learned quite a bit about systems of oppression and how they can be blind to one another by talking to black men.
I was once talking to a black man about gender and he said to me, "Why do you have to say 'my experience as a woman'?
Why can't it be 'your experience as a human being'?" Now, this was the same man who would often talk about his experience as a black man.
Gender matters. Men and women experience the world differently.
Gender colors the way we experience the world.
But we can change that.
Some people will say, "Oh, but women have the real power, bottom power." And for non-Nigerians, bottom power is an expression which I suppose means something like a woman who uses her sexuality to get favors from men.
But bottom power is not power at all.
Bottom power means that a woman simply has a good root to tap into, from time to time -- somebody else's power.
And then, of course, we have to wonder what happens when that somebody else is in a bad mood, or sick or impotent.
(Laughter)
Some people will say that a woman being subordinate to a man is our culture.
But culture is constantly changing.
I have beautiful twin nieces who are fifteen and live in Lagos.
If they had been born a hundred years ago they would have been taken away and killed.
Because it was our culture, it was our culture to kill twins.
So what is the point of culture?
I mean there's the decorative, the dancing... but also, culture really is about preservation and continuity of a people.
In my family, I am the child who is most interested in the story of who we are, in our traditions, in the knowledge about ancestral lands.
My brothers are not as interested as I am.
But I cannot participate, I cannot go to umunna meetings, I cannot have a say.
Because I'm female.
Culture does not make people, people make culture.
So if it is in fact true —
So if it is in fact true that the full humanity of women is not our culture, then we must make it our culture.
I think very often of my dear friend, Okoloma Maduewesi.
May he and all the others who passed away in that Sosoliso crash continue to rest in peace.
He will always be remembered by those of us who loved him.
And he was right that day many years ago when he called me a feminist.
I am a feminist. And when I looked up the word in the dictionary that day, this is what it said: "Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes." My great grandmother, from the stories I've heard, was a feminist.
She ran away from the house of the man she did not want to marry and ended up marrying the man of her choice.
She refused, she protested, she spoke up whenever she felt she was being deprived of access, of land, that sort of thing.
My great grandmother did not know that word "feminist," but it doesn't mean that she wasn't one.
More of us should reclaim that word.
My own definition of feminist is: "A feminist is a man or a woman who says —
(Laughter)
A feminist is a man or a woman who says, "Yes, there's a problem with gender as it is today, and we must fix it.
We must do better." The best feminist I know is my brother Kene.
He's also a kind, good-looking, lovely man, and he's very masculine.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Two months ago, my kids and I huddled around a cell phone watching the live stream of the Game Awards, one of the video game industry's biggest nights.
They announced the nominees for the Game for Impact, an award that's given to a thought-provoking video game with a profound prosocial message or meaning.
They opened the envelope and they read the title of our video game.
An award ... for impact.
It was almost funny, actually, because I always thought that winning an award like that would have this huge impact on my life, but I found that the opposite is true.
The big nights, the accomplishments -- they fade.
But the hardest nights of my life have stuck with me, impacting who I am and what I do.
In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain tumor.
And before that year was finished, doctors sat my husband and I down and let us know that his tumor had returned despite the most aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that they could offer him.
On that terrible night, after learning that Joel had perhaps four months to live, I cuddled up with my two older sons in bed -- they were five and three at the time -- and I never really knew how much they understood, so I started telling them a bedtime story.
I told them about this very brave knight named Joel and his adventure fighting a terrible dragon called cancer.
Every night, I told them more of the story, but I never let the story end.
I was just building up a context that they could understand and hoping that our prayers would be answered and I would never have to tell them that that knight, who had fought so bravely, was done fighting and could rest now, forever.
Fortunately, I never did have to finish that bedtime story.
My children outgrew it.
Joel responded better than anyone expected to palliative treatment, and so instead of months, we spent years learning how to love our dying child with all of our hearts.
Learning to recognize that shameful feeling of holding back just a little love to try to spare ourselves just a little pain somewhere further down the road.
We pushed past that self-preservation because Joel was worth loving even if that love could crush us.
And that lesson of intense vulnerability has changed me ... more than any award ever could.
We started living like Joel could live, and we began developing a video game called "That Dragon, Cancer." It was the story of Joel.
It was the story of hope in the shadow of death.
It was the story of faith and doubt, and the realization that a wrestle with doubt is a part of faith -- maybe the biggest part of it.
It was a story that began as a miracle and ended as a memorial.
(Music)
(Video) Dad: Bouncing around, do you like that?
I love your giggle.
When you play "That Dragon, Cancer," you're transformed into a witness of Joel's life, exploring an emotional landscape, clicking to discover more of what we as a family felt and experienced.
It feels a little bit like analyzing interactive poetry because every game mechanic is a metaphor, and so the more the player asks themselves what we as designers were trying to express and why, the richer the experience becomes.
We took that vulnerability that Joel taught us, and we encoded the game with it.
Players expect their video games to offer them branching narrative so that every decision that they make feels important and can change the outcome of the game.
We subverted that principle of game design, collapsing the choices in on the player so that they discover for themselves that there is nothing that they can do that will change the outcome for Joel.
And they feel that discovery as deeply and desperately as we felt it on nights when we held Joel in our arms praying for hours, stubbornly holding out hope for a grace that we could not create for ourselves.
We'd all prefer to win, but when you discover that you can't win, what do you value instead?
I never planned to write video games, but these moments that really change our lives, they often come as the result of our hardship -- and not our glory.
When we thought that Joel could live, I left the game designing to my husband.
I chimed in here and there with a scene or two and some suggestions.
But after the night that Joel died, the passion, the possibility of sharing Joel's life through our video game -- it was something that I couldn't resist.
I started writing more, I sat in on our team's design meetings, I added more ideas and I helped direct scenes.
And I discovered that creating a video game is telling a story, but with an entirely new vocabulary.
All the same elements of imagination and symbolism are there, but they're just partnered with player agency and system responsiveness.
It's challenging work.
I have to think in a totally new way to do it, but I love it.
And I wouldn't have known that without Joel.
Maybe you're a little surprised by our choice to share our story of terminal cancer through a video game.
Perhaps you're even thinking like so many people before you: cancer is not a game.
Well, tell that to any pediatric cancer parent that's ever taken an exam glove and blown it up into a balloon, or transformed a syringe into a rocket ship, or let their child ride their IV pole through the hospital halls like it was a race car.
Because when you have children, everything is a game.
And when your young child experiences something traumatic, you work even harder to make sure that their life feels like a game because children naturally explore their worlds through play.
While cancer can steal many things from a family, it shouldn't steal play.
If you're listening to me and you're trying to imagine this family that revolves entirely around a dying child, and you can't imagine joy as part of that picture, then we were right to share our story with you, because that season of our life was hard.
Unspeakably hard at times, but it was also pure hope, deep love and joy like I have never experienced since.
Our video game was our attempt to share that world with people who hadn't experienced it before, because we never could imagine that world until it became ours.
We made a video game that's hard to play.
It will never be a blockbuster.
People have to prepare themselves to invest emotionally in a story that they know will break their hearts.
But when our hearts break, they heal a little differently.
My broken heart has been healing with a new and a deeper compassion -- a desire to sit with people in their pain, to hear their stories and try to help tell them so that they know that they're seen.
On the night when "That Dragon, Cancer" won the Game for Impact Award, we cheered, we smiled and we talked about Joel and the impact he had on our life — on all of those hard and hopeful nights that we shared with him when he changed our hearts and taught us so much more about life and love and faith and purpose.
That award will never mean as much to me as even a single photograph of my son, but it does represent all of the people who his life has impacted, people I'll never meet.
They write me emails sometimes.
They tell me that they miss Joel, even though they never met him.
They describe the tears that they've shed for my son, and it makes my burden of grief just a little bit lighter knowing that it's shared with a 10-year-old watching a YouTube playthrough, or a doctor playing on his airplane with a smartphone, or a professor introducing Joel to her first-year philosophy students.
We made a video game that's hard to play.
But that feels just right to me, because the hardest moments of our lives change us more than any goal we could ever accomplish.
Tragedy has shifted my heart more than any dream I could ever see come true.
Thank you.
(Applause)
The school of architecture that I studied at some 30 years ago happened to be across the street from the wonderful art gallery designed by the great architect Louis Kahn.
I love the building, and I used to visit it quite often.
One day, I saw the security guard run his hand across the concrete wall.
And it was the way he did it, the expression on his face -- something touched me.
I could see that the security guard was moved by the building and that architecture has that capacity to move you.
I could see it, and I remember thinking, "Wow.
How does architecture do that? "
At school, I was learning to design, but here -- here was a reaction of the heart.
And it touched me to the core.
You know, you aspire for beauty, for sensuousness, for atmosphere, the emotional response.
That's the realm of the ineffable and the immeasurable.
And that's what you live for: a chance to try.
So in 2003, there was an open call for designs for the Bahá'í Temple for South America.
This was the first temple in all of South America.
It's a continental temple, a hugely important milestone for the Bahá'í community, because this would be the last of the continental temples and would open the door for national and local temples to be built around the world.
And the brief was deceptively simple and unique in the annals of religion: a circular room, nine sides, nine entrances, nine paths, allowing you to come to the temple from all directions, nine symbolizing completeness, perfection.
No pulpit, no sermons, as there are no clergy in the Bahá'í faith.
And in a world which is putting up walls, the design needed to express in form the very opposite.
It had to be open, welcoming to people of all faiths, walks of life, backgrounds, or no faith at all; a new form of sacred space with no pattern or models to draw from.
It was like designing one of the first churches for Christianity or one of the first mosques for Islam.
So we live in a secular world.
How do you design sacred space today?
And how do you even define what's sacred today?
I stumbled across this beautiful quote from the Bahá'í writings, and it speaks to prayer.
It says that if you reach out in prayer, and if your prayer is answered -- which is already very interesting -- that the pillars of your heart will become ashine.
And I loved this idea of the inner and the outer, like when you see someone and you say, "That person is radiant." And I was thinking, "My gosh, how could we make something architectural out of that, where you create a building and it becomes alive with light?
Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light, it becomes alive.
And I drew this sketch, something with two layers, translucent with structure in between capturing light.
Maybe a pure form, a single form of emanation that you could imagine would be all dome and everything we kept making was looking too much like an egg.
(Laughter)
A blob.
So you search. You all know this crazy search, letting the process take you, and you live for the surprises.
And I remember quite by accident I saw this little video of a plant moving in light, and it made me think of movement, reach, this idea that the temple could have reach, like this reach for the divine.
You can imagine also that movement within a circle could mean movement and stillness, like the cosmos, something you see in many places.
(Laughter)
But rotation was not enough, because we needed a form.
In the Bahá'í writings, it talks about the temples being as perfect as is humanly possible, and we kept thinking, well, what is perfection?
And I remember I stumbled into this image of this Japanese basket and thinking our Western notions of perfection need to be challenged, that this wonderful silhouette of this basket, this wonkiness, and that it has the kind of dimple of what you might imagine a shoulder or the cheekbone, and that kind of organic form.
And so we drew and made models, these lines that merge at the top, soft lines, which became like drapery and translucent veils and folding, and the idea of not only folding but torquing -- you remember the plant and the way it was reaching.
And this started to become an interesting form, carving the base, making the entrances.
And then we ended up with this. This is this temple with two layers, nine luminous veils, embodied light, soft-flowing lines like luminescent drapery.
180 submissions were received from 80 countries, and this was selected.
So we went to the next stage of how to build it.
We had submitted alabaster. But alabaster was too soft, and we were experimenting, many experiments with materials, trying to think how we could have this kind of shimmer, and we ended up with borosilicate.
And borosilicate glass, as you know, is very strong, and if you break borosilicate rods just so and melt them at just the right temperature, we ended up with this new material, this new cast glass which took us about two years to make.
And it had this quality that we loved, this idea of the embodied light, but on the inside, we wanted something with a soft light, like the inner lining of a jacket.
On the outside you have protection, but on the inside you touch it.
So we found this tiny vein in a huge quarry in Portugal with this beautiful stone, which the owner had kept for seven generations in his family, waiting for the right project, if you can believe it.
Look at this material, it's beautiful.
And the way it lights up; it has that translucent quality.
So here you see the structure.
It lets the light through.
And looking down, the nine wings are bound, structurally but symbolically strong, a great symbol of unity: pure geometry, a perfect circle, 30 meters in section and in plan, perfectly symmetrical, like the idea of sacredness and geometry.
And here you see the building going up, 2,000 steel nodes, 9,000 pieces of steel, 7,800 stone pieces, 10,000 cast glass pieces, all individual shapes, the entire superstructure all described, engineered, fabricated with aerospace technology, prefabricated machine to machine, robotically, a huge team effort, you can imagine, of literally hundreds, and within three percent of our $30 million budget set in 2006.
(Applause)
Nine wings bound together forming a nine-pointed star, and the star shape moving in space, tracking the sun.
So here it is.
Audience: Wow!
(Applause)
Hopefully, a befitting response to that beautiful quote, "a prayer answered," open in all directions, capturing the blue light of dawn, tent-like white light of day, the gold light of the afternoon, and of course, at night, the reversal: sensuous, catching the light in all kinds of mysterious ways.
And the site: it's interesting; 14 years ago when we made the submission, we showed the temple set against the Andes.
We didn't have the Andes as our site, but after nine years, that's exactly where we ended up, the lines of the temple set against nothing but pure nature, and you turn around and you get nothing but the city below you, and inside, a view in all directions, radiating gardens from each of the alcoves, radiating paths.
Last October, the opening ceremonies -- a beautiful, sacred event, 5,000 people from 80 countries, a continuous river of visitors, indigenous people from all over South America, some who had never left their villages.
And of course, that this temple belongs to people, the collective, of many cultures and walks of life, many beliefs, and for me, what's most important is what it feels like on the inside; that it feel intimate, sacred, and that everyone is welcome.
And if even a few who come have the same reaction as that security guard, then it truly would be their temple.
And I would love that.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I would like to tell you about the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me in my years of working as a palliative care physician.
This happened a couple of years ago.
I was asked as a consultant to see a woman in her 70s -- retired English professor who had pancreatic cancer.
I was asked to see her because she had pain, nausea, vomiting ... When I went to see her, we talked about those symptoms and in the course of that consultation, she asked me whether I thought that medical marijuana might help her.
I thought back to everything that I had learned in medical school about medical marijuana, which didn't take very long because I had learned absolutely nothing.
And so I told her that as far as I knew, medical marijuana had no benefits whatsoever.
And she smiled and nodded and reached into the handbag next to the bed, and pulled out a stack of about a dozen randomized controlled trials showing that medical marijuana has benefits for symptoms like nausea and pain and anxiety.
She handed me those articles and said, "Maybe you should read these before offering an opinion ... doctor."
(Laughter)
So I did. That night I read all of those articles and found a bunch more.
When I came to see her the next morning, I had to admit that it looks like there is some evidence that marijuana can offer medical benefits and I suggested that if she really was interested, she should try it.
You know what she said?
This 73-year-old, retired English professor?
She said, "I did try it about six months ago. It was amazing. I've been using it every day since.
It's the best drug I've discovered.
I don't know why it took me 73 years to discover this stuff. It's amazing."
(Laughter)
That was the moment at which I realized I needed to learn something about medical marijuana because what I was prepared for in medical school bore no relationship to reality.
So I started reading more articles, I started talking to researchers, I started talking to doctors, and most importantly, I started listening to patients.
I ended up writing a book based on those conversations, and that book really revolved around three surprises -- surprises to me, anyway.
One I already alluded to -- that there really are some benefits to medical marijuana.
Those benefits may not be as huge or as stunning as some of the most avid proponents of medical marijuana would have us believe, but they are real.
Surprise number two: medical marijuana does have some risks.
Those risks may not be as huge and as scary as some of the opponents of medical marijuana would have us believe, but they are real risks, nonetheless.
But it was the third surprise that was most ... surprising.
And that is that a lot of the patients I talked with who've turned to medical marijuana for help, weren't turning to medical marijuana because of its benefits or the balance of risks and benefits, or because they thought it was a wonder drug, but because it gave them control over their illness.
It let them manage their health in a way that was productive and efficient and effective and comfortable for them.
To show you what I mean, let me tell you about another patient.
Robin was in her early 40s when I met her.
She looked though like she was in her late 60s.
She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for the last 20 years, her hands were gnarled by arthritis, her spine was crooked, she had to rely on a wheelchair to get around.
She looked weak and frail, and I guess physically she probably was, but emotionally, cognitively, psychologically, she was among the toughest people I've ever met.
And when I sat down next to her in a medical marijuana dispensary in Northern California to ask her about why she turned to medical marijuana, what it did for her and how it helped her, she started out by telling me things that I had heard from many patients before.
It helped with her anxiety; it helped with her pain; when her pain was better, she slept better.
And I'd heard all that before.
But then she said something that I'd never heard before, and that is that it gave her control over her life and over her health.
She could use it when she wanted, in the way that she wanted, at the dose and frequency that worked for her.
And if it didn't work for her, then she could make changes.
Everything was up to her.
The most important thing she said was she didn't need anybody else's permission -- not a clinic appointment, not a doctor's prescription, not a pharmacist's order.
It was all up to her.
She was in control.
And if that seems like a little thing for somebody with chronic illness, it's not -- not at all.
When we face a chronic serious illness, whether it's rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or cancer or diabetes, or cirrhosis, we lose control.
And note what I said: "when," not "if." All of us at some point in our lives will face a chronic serious illness that causes us to lose control.
We'll see our function decline, some of us will see our cognition decline, we'll be no longer able to care for ourselves, to do the things that we want to do.
Our bodies will betray us, and in that process, we'll lose control.
And that's scary.
Not just scary -- that's frightening, it's terrifying.
When I talk to my patients, my palliative care patients, many of whom are facing illnesses that will end their lives, they have a lot of be frightened of -- pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, fatigue, their impending mortality.
But what scares them more than anything else is this possibility that at some point, tomorrow or a month from now, they're going to lose control of their health, of their lives, of their healthcare, and they're going to become dependent on others, and that's terrifying.
So it's no wonder really that patients like Robin, who I just told you about, who I met in that clinic, turn to medical marijuana to try to claw back some semblance of control. How do they do it though? How do these medical marijuana dispensaries -- like the one where I met Robin -- how do they give patients like Robin back the sort of control that they need?
And how do they do it in a way that mainstream medical hospitals and clinics, at least for Robin, weren't able to?
What's their secret?
So I decided to find out.
I went to a seedy clinic in Venice Beach in California and got a recommendation that would allow me to be a medical marijuana patient. I got a letter of recommendation that would let me buy medical marijuana.
I got that recommendation illegally, because I'm not a resident of California -- I should note that.
I should also note, for the record, that I never used that letter of recommendation to make a purchase, and to all of you DEA agents out there --
(Laughter)
love the work that you're doing, keep it up.
(Laughter)
Even though it didn't let me make a purchase though, that letter was priceless because it let me be a patient.
It let me experience what patients like Robin experience when they go to a medical marijuana dispensary.
And what I experienced — what they experience every day, hundreds of thousands of people like Robin — was really amazing.
I walked into the clinic, and from the moment that I entered many of these clinics and dispensaries, I felt like that dispensary, that clinic, was there for me.
There were questions at the outset about who I am, what kind of work I do, what my goals are in looking for a medical marijuana prescription, or product, what my goals are, what my preferences are, what my hopes are, how do I think, how do I hope this might help me, what am I afraid of.
These are the sorts of questions that patients like Robin get asked all the time.
These are the sorts of questions that make me confident that the person I'm talking with really has my best interests at heart and wants to get to know me.
The second thing I learned in those clinics is the availability of education.
Education from the folks behind the counter, but also education from folks in the waiting room.
People I met were more than happy, as I was sitting next to them -- people like Robin -- to tell me about who they are, why they use medical marijuana, what helps them, how it helps them, and to give me advice and suggestions.
Those waiting rooms really are a hive of interaction, advice and support.
And third, the folks behind the counter.
I was amazed at how willing those people were to spend sometimes an hour or more talking me through the nuances of this strain versus that strain, smoking versus vaporizing, edibles versus tinctures -- all, remember, without me making any purchase whatsoever.
Think about the last time you went to any hospital or clinic and the last time anybody spent an hour explaining those sorts of things to you.
The fact that patients like Robin are going to these clinics, are going to these dispensaries and getting that sort of personalized attention and education and service, really should be a wake-up call to the healthcare system.
People like Robin are turning away from mainstream medicine, turning to medical marijuana dispensaries because those dispensaries are giving them what they need.
If that's a wake-up call to the medical establishment, it's a wake-up call that many of my colleagues are either not hearing or not wanting to hear.
When I talk to my colleagues, physicians in particular, about medical marijuana, they say, "Oh, we need more evidence.
We need more research into benefits, we need more evidence about risks." And you know what? They're right. They're absolutely right.
We do need much more evidence about the benefits of medical marijuana.
We also need to ask the federal government to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II, or to deschedule it entirely to make that research possible.
We also need more research into medical marijuana's risks.
Medical marijuana's risks -- we know a lot about the risks of recreational use, we know next to nothing about the risks of medical marijuana.
So we absolutely do need research, but to say that we need research and not that we need to make any changes now is to miss the point entirely.
People like Robin aren't seeking out medical marijuana because they think it's a wonder drug, or because they think it's entirely risk-free.
They seek it out because the context in which it's delivered and administered and used, gives them the sort of control they need over their lives.
And that's a wake-up call we really need to pay attention to.
The good news though is that there are lessons we can learn today from those medical marijuana dispensaries.
And those are lessons we really should learn.
These are often small, mom-and-pop operations run by people with no medical training.
And while it's embarrassing to think that many of these clinics and dispensaries are providing services and support and meeting patients' needs in ways that billion-dollar healthcare systems aren't -- we should be embarrassed by that -- but we can also learn from that.
And there are probably three lessons at least that we can learn from those small dispensaries.
One: we need to find ways to give patients more control in small but important ways.
How to interact with healthcare providers, when to interact with healthcare providers, how to use medications in ways that work for them.
In my own practice, I've gotten much more creative and flexible in supporting my patients in using drugs safely to manage their symptoms -- with the emphasis on safely.
Many of the drugs I prescribe are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines which can be dangerous if overused.
But here's the point. They can be dangerous if they're overused, but they can also be ineffective if they're not used in a way that's consistent with what patients want and need.
So that flexibility, if it's delivered safely, can be extraordinarily valuable for patients and their families.
That's number one.
Number two: education. Huge opportunities to learn from some of the tricks of those medical marijuana dispensaries to provide more education that doesn't require a lot of physician time necessarily, or any physician time, but opportunities to learn about what medications we're using and why, prognoses, trajectories of illness, and most importantly, opportunities for patients to learn from each other.
How can we replicate what goes on in those clinic and medical dispensary waiting rooms?
How patients learn from each other, how people share with each other.
And last but not least, putting patients first the way those medical marijuana dispensaries do, making patients feel legitimately like what they want, what they need, is why, as healthcare providers, we're here.
Asking patients about their hopes, their fears, their goals and preferences.
As a palliative care provider, I ask all my patients what they're hoping for and what they're afraid of. But here's the thing. Patients shouldn't have to wait until they're chronically seriously ill, often near the end of life, they shouldn't have to wait until they're seeing a physician like me before somebody asks them, "What are you hoping for?" "What are you afraid of?" That should be baked into the way that healthcare is delivered.
We can do this -- we really can.
Medical marijuana dispensaries and clinics all across the country are figuring this out.
They're figuring this out in ways that larger, more mainstream health systems are years behind.
But we can learn from them, and we have to learn from them.
All we have to do is swallow our pride -- put aside the thought for a minute that because we have lots of letters after our name, because we're experts, because we're chief medical officers of a large healthcare system, we know all there is to know about how to meet patients' needs.
We need to swallow our pride.
We need to go visit a few medical marijuana dispensaries.
We need to figure out what they're doing.
We need to figure out why so many patients like Robin are leaving our mainstream medical clinics and going to these medical marijuana dispensaries instead.
We need to figure out what their tricks are, what their tools are, and we need to learn from them.
If we do, and I think we can, and I absolutely think we have to, we can guarantee all of our patients will have a much better experience.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Space, the final frontier.
I first heard these words when I was just six years old, and I was completely inspired.
I wanted to explore strange new worlds.
I wanted to seek out new life.
I wanted to see everything that the universe had to offer.
And those dreams, those words, they took me on a journey, a journey of discovery, through school, through university, to do a PhD and finally to become a professional astronomer.
Now, I learned two amazing things, one slightly unfortunate, when I was doing my PhD.
I learned that the reality was I wouldn't be piloting a starship anytime soon.
But I also learned that the universe is strange, wonderful and vast, actually too vast to be explored by spaceship.
And so I turned my attention to astronomy, to using telescopes.
Now, I show you before you an image of the night sky.
You might see it anywhere in the world.
And all of these stars are part of our local galaxy, the Milky Way.
Now, if you were to go to a darker part of the sky, a nice dark site, perhaps in the desert, you might see the center of our Milky Way galaxy spread out before you, hundreds of billions of stars.
And it's a very beautiful image. It's colorful. And again, this is just a local corner of our universe.
You can see there's a sort of strange dark dust across it.
Now, that is local dust that's obscuring the light of the stars.
But we can do a pretty good job.
Just with our own eyes, we can explore our little corner of the universe.
It's possible to do better.
You can use wonderful telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope.
Now, astronomers have put together this image.
It's called the Hubble Deep Field, and they've spent hundreds of hours observing just a tiny patch of the sky no larger than your thumbnail held at arm's length.
And in this image you can see thousands of galaxies, and we know that there must be hundreds of millions, billions of galaxies in the entire universe, some like our own and some very different.
So you think, OK, well, I can continue this journey. This is easy. I can just use a very powerful telescope and just look at the sky, no problem.
It's actually really missing out if we just do that.
Now, that's because everything I've talked about so far is just using the visible spectrum, just the thing that your eyes can see, and that's a tiny slice, a tiny, tiny slice of what the universe has to offer us.
Now, there's also two very important problems with using visible light.
Not only are we missing out on all the other processes that are emitting other kinds of light, but there's two issues.
Now, the first is that dust that I mentioned earlier.
The dust stops the visible light from getting to us.
So as we look deeper into the universe, we see less light.
The dust stops it getting to us.
But there's a really strange problem with using visible light in order to try and explore the universe.
Now take a break for a minute. Say you're standing on a corner, a busy street corner.
There's cars going by. An ambulance approaches. It has a high-pitched siren.
(Imitates a siren passing by)
The siren appeared to change in pitch as it moved towards and away from you.
The ambulance driver did not change the siren just to mess with you.
That was a product of your perception.
The sound waves, as the ambulance approached, were compressed, and they changed higher in pitch.
As the ambulance receded, the sound waves were stretched, and they sounded lower in pitch.
The same thing happens with light.
Objects moving towards us, their light waves are compressed and they appear bluer.
Objects moving away from us, their light waves are stretched, and they appear redder.
So we call these effects blueshift and redshift.
Now, our universe is expanding, so everything is moving away from everything else, and that means everything appears to be red.
And oddly enough, as you look more deeply into the universe, more distant objects are moving away further and faster, so they appear more red.
So if I come back to the Hubble Deep Field and we were to continue to peer deeply into the universe just using the Hubble, as we get to a certain distance away, everything becomes red, and that presents something of a problem.
Eventually, we get so far away everything is shifted into the infrared and we can't see anything at all.
So there must be a way around this.
Otherwise, I'm limited in my journey.
I wanted to explore the whole universe, not just whatever I can see, you know, before the redshift kicks in.
There is a technique.
It's called radio astronomy.
Astronomers have been using this for decades.
It's a fantastic technique.
I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope, affectionately known as "The Dish." You may have seen the movie.
And radio is really brilliant.
It allows us to peer much more deeply.
It doesn't get stopped by dust, so you can see everything in the universe, and redshift is less of a problem because we can build receivers that receive across a large band.
So what does Parkes see when we turn it to the center of the Milky Way?
We should see something fantastic, right?
Well, we do see something interesting.
All that dust has gone.
As I mentioned, radio goes straight through dust, so not a problem.
But the view is very different.
We can see that the center of the Milky Way is aglow, and this isn't starlight.
This is a light called synchrotron radiation, and it's formed from electrons spiraling around cosmic magnetic fields.
So the plane is aglow with this light.
And we can also see strange tufts coming off of it, and objects which don't appear to line up with anything that we can see with our own eyes.
But it's hard to really interpret this image, because as you can see, it's very low resolution.
Radio waves have a wavelength that's long, and that makes their resolution poorer.
This image is also black and white, so we don't really know what is the color of everything in here. Well, fast-forward to today.
We can build telescopes which can get over these problems.
Now, I'm showing you here an image of the Murchison Radio Observatory, a fantastic place to build radio telescopes.
It's flat, it's dry, and most importantly, it's radio quiet: no mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing, just very, very radio quiet, so a perfect place to build a radio telescope.
Now, the telescope that I've been working on for a few years is called the Murchison Widefield Array, and I'm going to show you a little time lapse of it being built.
This is a group of undergraduate and postgraduate students located in Perth.
We call them the Student Army, and they volunteered their time to build a radio telescope.
There's no course credit for this.
And they're putting together these radio dipoles.
They just receive at low frequencies, a bit like your FM radio or your TV.
And here we are deploying them across the desert.
The final telescope covers 10 square kilometers of the Western Australian desert.
And the interesting thing is, there's no moving parts.
We just deploy these little antennas essentially on chicken mesh.
It's fairly cheap.
Cables take the signals from the antennas and bring them to central processing units.
And it's the size of this telescope, the fact that we've built it over the entire desert that gives us a better resolution than Parkes.
Now, eventually all those cables bring them to a unit which sends it off to a supercomputer here in Perth, and that's where I come in.
(Sighs)
Radio data. I have spent the last five years working with very difficult, very interesting data that no one had really looked at before.
I've spent a long time calibrating it, running millions of CPU hours on supercomputers and really trying to understand that data.
And with this telescope, with this data, we've performed a survey of the entire southern sky, the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA Survey, or GLEAM, as I call it.
And I'm very excited.
This survey is just about to be published, but it hasn't been shown yet, so you are literally the first people to see this southern survey of the entire sky.
So I'm delighted to share with you some images from this survey.
Now, imagine you went to the Murchison, you camped out underneath the stars and you looked towards the south.
You saw the south's celestial pole, the galaxy rising.
If I fade in the radio light, this is what we observe with our survey.
You can see that the galactic plane is no longer dark with dust. It's alight with synchrotron radiation, and thousands of dots are in the sky.
Our large Magellanic Cloud, our nearest galactic neighbor, is orange instead of its more familiar blue-white.
So there's a lot going on in this.
Let's take a closer look. If we look back towards the galactic center, where we originally saw the Parkes image that I showed you earlier, low resolution, black and white, and we fade to the GLEAM view, you can see the resolution has gone up by a factor of a hundred.
We now have a color view of the sky, a technicolor view.
Now, it's not a false color view.
These are real radio colors.
What I've done is I've colored the lowest frequencies red and the highest frequencies blue, and the middle ones green.
And that gives us this rainbow view.
And this isn't just false color.
The colors in this image tell us about the physical processes going on in the universe.
So for instance, if you look along the plane of the galaxy, it's alight with synchrotron, which is mostly reddish orange, but if we look very closely, we see little blue dots.
Now, if we zoom in, these blue dots are ionized plasma around very bright stars, and what happens is that they block the red light, so they appear blue.
And these can tell us about these star-forming regions in our galaxy.
And we just see them immediately.
We look at the galaxy, and the color tells us that they're there.
You can see little soap bubbles, little circular images around the galactic plane, and these are supernova remnants.
When a star explodes, its outer shell is cast off and it travels outward into space gathering up material, and it produces a little shell.
It's been a long-standing mystery to astronomers where all the supernova remnants are.
We know that there must be a lot of high-energy electrons in the plane to produce the synchrotron radiation that we see, and we think they're produced by supernova remnants, but there don't seem to be enough.
Fortunately, GLEAM is really, really good at detecting supernova remnants, so we're hoping to have a new paper out on that soon. Now, that's fine.
We've explored our little local universe, but I wanted to go deeper, I wanted to go further.
I wanted to go beyond the Milky Way.
Well, as it happens, we can see a very interesting object in the top right, and this is a local radio galaxy, Centaurus A. If we zoom in on this, we can see that there are two huge plumes going out into space.
And if you look right in the center between those two plumes, you'll see a galaxy just like our own.
It's a spiral.
It has a dust lane.
It's a normal galaxy.
But these jets are only visible in the radio.
If we looked in the visible, we wouldn't even know they were there, and they're thousands of times larger than the host galaxy.
What's going on? What's producing these jets?
At the center of every galaxy that we know about is a supermassive black hole.
Now, black holes are invisible.
That's why they're called that. All you can see is the deflection of the light around them, and occasionally, when a star or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit, it is ripped apart by tidal forces, forming what we call an accretion disk.
The accretion disk glows brightly in the x-rays, and huge magnetic fields can launch the material into space at nearly the speed of light.
So these jets are visible in the radio and this is what we pick up in our survey.
Well, very well, so we've seen one radio galaxy. That's nice. But if you just look at the top of that image, you'll see another radio galaxy.
It's a little bit smaller, and that's just because it's further away. OK. Two radio galaxies. We can see this. This is fine. Well, what about all the other dots?
Presumably those are just stars. They're not. They're all radio galaxies.
Every single one of the dots in this image is a distant galaxy, millions to billions of light-years away with a supermassive black hole at its center pushing material into space at nearly the speed of light. It is mind-blowing. And this survey is even larger than what I've shown here.
If we zoom out to the full extent of the survey, you can see I found 300,000 of these radio galaxies.
So it's truly an epic journey.
We've discovered all of these galaxies right back to the very first supermassive black holes.
I'm very proud of this, and it will be published next week.
Now, that's not all.
I've explored the furthest reaches of the galaxy with this survey, but there's something even more in this image.
Now, I'll take you right back to the dawn of time.
When the universe formed, it was a big bang, which left the universe as a sea of hydrogen, neutral hydrogen.
And when the very first stars and galaxies switched on, they ionized that hydrogen.
So the universe went from neutral to ionized.
That imprinted a signal all around us.
Everywhere, it pervades us, like the Force.
Now, because that happened so long ago, the signal was redshifted, so now that signal is at very low frequencies.
It's at the same frequency as my survey, but it's so faint.
It's a billionth the size of any of the objects in my survey.
So our telescope may not be quite sensitive enough to pick up this signal.
However, there's a new radio telescope.
So I can't have a starship, but I can hopefully have one of the biggest radio telescopes in the world.
We're building the Square Kilometre Array, a new radio telescope, and it's going to be a thousand times bigger than the MWA, a thousand times more sensitive, and have an even better resolution.
So we should find tens of millions of galaxies.
And perhaps, deep in that signal, I will get to look upon the very first stars and galaxies switching on, the beginning of time itself.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to tell you a story about a girl.
But I can't tell you her real name. So let's just call her Hadiza.
Hadiza is 20. She's shy, but she has a beautiful smile that lights up her face.
But she's in constant pain.
And she will likely be on medication for the rest of her life.
Do you want to know why? Hadiza is a Chibok girl, and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists.
She managed to escape, though, by jumping off the truck that was carrying the girls.
But when she landed, she broke both her legs, and she had to crawl on her tummy to hide in the bushes.
She told me she was terrified that Boko Haram would come back for her.
She was one of 57 girls who would escape by jumping off trucks that day.
This story, quite rightly, caused ripples around the world.
People like Michelle Obama, Malala and others lent their voices in protest, and at about the same time -- I was living in London at the time -- I was sent from London to Abuja to cover the World Economic Forum that Nigeria was hosting for the first time.
But when we arrived, it was clear that there was only one story in town.
We put the government under pressure. We asked tough questions about what they were doing to bring these girls back.
Understandably, they weren't too happy with our line of questioning, and let's just say we received our fair share of "alternative facts."
(Laughter)
Influential Nigerians were telling us at the time that we were naïve, we didn't understand the political situation in Nigeria.
But they also told us that the story of the Chibok girls was a hoax.
Sadly, this hoax narrative has persisted, and there are still people in Nigeria today who believe that the Chibok girls were never kidnapped.
Yet I was talking to people like these -- devastated parents, who told us that on the day Boko Haram kidnapped their daughters, they ran into the Sambisa Forest after the trucks carrying their daughters.
They were armed with machetes, but they were forced to turn back because Boko Haram had guns.
For two years, inevitably, the news agenda moved on, and for two years, we didn't hear much about the Chibok girls.
Everyone presumed they were dead.
But in April last year, I was able to obtain this video.
This is a still from the video that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life, and through a source, I obtained this video.
But before I could publish it, I had to travel to the northeast of Nigeria to talk to the parents, to verify it.
I didn't have to wait too long for confirmation.
One of the mothers, when she watched the video, told me that if she could have reached into the laptop and pulled our her child from the laptop, she would have done so.
For those of you who are parents, like myself, in the audience, you can only imagine the anguish that that mother felt.
This video would go on to kick-start negotiation talks with Boko Haram.
And a Nigerian senator told me that because of this video they entered into those talks, because they had long presumed that the Chibok girls were dead.
Twenty-one girls were freed in October last year.
Sadly, nearly 200 of them still remain missing.
I must confess that I have not been a dispassionate observer covering this story.
I am furious when I think about the wasted opportunities to rescue these girls.
I am furious when I think about what the parents have told me, that if these were daughters of the rich and the powerful, they would have been found much earlier.
And I am furious that the hoax narrative, I firmly believe, caused a delay; it was part of the reason for the delay in their return.
This illustrates to me the deadly danger of fake news.
So what can we do about it?
There are some very smart people, smart engineers at Google and Facebook, who are trying to use technology to stop the spread of fake news.
But beyond that, I think everybody here -- you and I -- we have a role to play in that.
We are the ones who share the content.
We are the ones who share the stories online.
In this day and age, we're all publishers, and we have responsibility.
In my job as a journalist, I check, I verify.
I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.
Why is this person telling me this story?
What do they have to gain by sharing this information?
Do they have a hidden agenda?
I really believe that we must all start to ask tougher questions of information that we discover online.
Research shows that some of us don't even read beyond headlines before we share stories.
Who here has done that?
I know I have.
But what if we stopped taking information that we discover at face value?
What if we stop to think about the consequence of the information that we pass on and its potential to incite violence or hatred?
What if we stop to think about the real-life consequences of the information that we share?
Thank you very much for listening.

Fresh out of college, I went to work for a consulting firm.
During orientation, the leaders dished out advice.
Amongst them was one pithy counsel I will never forget. He told us, "Be easy to manage." Considering how naïve I really was at the time, I took his advice to heart.
I told myself, "Yes, I will be the ultimate team player.
I will do everything I'm told.
I will be easy to manage." It wasn't until I arrived in graduate school and witnessed firsthand the criminal actions of scientists and engineers in the water crisis in Flint, Michigan that I realized how dangerous and yet surprisingly common this line of thinking really is.
Make no mistake: the Flint water crisis is one of the most egregious environmental injustices of our time.
For over 18 months, 100,000 residents, including thousands of young children, were exposed to contaminated drinking water with high levels of lead.
Lead is a potent neurotoxin which causes cognitive and developmental disabilities and is especially harmful to growing fetuses and young children.
We've known about its dangers since the Roman Empire.
Amongst a whole host of health issues, 12 people died by contracting Legionnaires' disease.
Flint's water infrastructure -- the complex network of underground pipes -- has been severely damaged.
And while the water quality is slowly improving and the pipes are being replaced now, more than two years later, the water is still not safe to drink.
So, people are still in shock.
They ask themselves, "How could this have happened?" The short answer is: the crisis began when an emergency manager, appointed by Michigan's governor, decided to switch their water source to a local river to save money.
But it continued for so long because scientists and engineers at government agencies in the state of Michigan and in the federal government did not follow federal regulations for treating the water right.
What was more, they actively cheated on the law and orchestrated cover-ups.
They ridiculed residents asking for help, while publicly insisting that the brown, smelly water coming out of the tap was safe to drink.
The system at the local, state and federal levels completely failed to protect our most vulnerable, and an entire population was left to fend for itself.
Now, amidst this injustice, Flint residents were rallying together.
Amongst them were some amazing women of Flint -- mothers concerned about their kids -- who came together forming many grassroots coalitions, and these groups started protesting and demanding change.
The group also reached out to outside scientists for help, and a few responded.
Amongst them was a guy named Miguel Del Toral, a water expert at the US EPA -- the Environmental Protection Agency -- who actually wrote this scientific memo and sent it to the state of Michigan and the federal government to bring their attention to this problem.
He was characterized a "rogue employee," and silenced.
In collaboration with Flint residents, our research team here at Tech, of students and scientists led by professor Marc Edwards, conducted citywide testing to prove that Flint's water was indeed contaminated, even toxic in some homes.
We substantiated what Flint had been screaming for months, and put it on the Internet for the world to see.
Now, when I was getting involved, when I said yes to this, I had no idea what I was getting into.
But every second of this journey has been totally worth it.
This was science in service to the public.
This is what I came to graduate school for, and this is how I would rather spend my life.
And so this coalition -- this unlikely coalition of citizens, pastors, journalists and scientists -- came together to uncover the truth using science, advocacy and activism.
A local pediatrician figured out that the instances of childhood lead poisoning had indeed doubled in Flint during the crisis.
And the state of Michigan was forced to acknowledge the problem and take steps to correct it.
This group and many others got Flint's kids protected.
A few months later, President Obama came in and declared a federal emergency, and now Flint is getting more than 600 million dollars in healthcare, nutrition, education and overhauling their water infrastructure.
However, the arrogance and the callous disregard for public health shown by scientists and engineers at these government agencies is beyond belief.
These unhealthy cultures that are festering in these groups, where the focus is on meeting regulations and checking boxes as opposed to protecting public health, is just appalling. Just consider this email that an EPA employee wrote, where she goes, "I'm not so sure Flint is a community we want to go out on a limb for." The dehumanization of an entire population could not be more obvious.
Now, contrast that to the first canon of engineering, which, in my opinion, should be the first law of humanity: "To hold paramount the health, safety and welfare of the public," above all else.
This is the Hippocratic Oath we've rarely acknowledged, let alone embraced.
And so when scientists and engineers, very much like medical doctors, screw up, people can get hurt — even die.
If our professionals and even students fail to get that, society pays a huge price.
Buried deep in history lies a character I deeply admire -- an engineer named Peter Palchinsky.
He lived in the time of the Soviet Union.
And Palchinsky repeatedly got in trouble for his radical honesty and willingness to point out major flaws in the Soviets' mindless pursuit of rapid industrialization.
Everyone was expected to follow orders coming from the top.
Anyone asking questions or offering feedback was unwelcome.
The Soviets had created the largest army of engineers the world had ever seen, and yet most of them were mere cogs in a gigantic machine heading for doom.
Palchinsky, on the other hand, implored engineers to look at the economic, political and social consequences of their actions; in other words, be more public-focused.
His fearless voice of reason was seen as a threat to the political establishment, and Joseph Stalin had him executed in 1929.
Palchinsky's view on technocrats is very different from one that is still very popular, still very common -- that of a dispassionate researcher working in his ivory tower lab, or a nerdy engineer working in his cubicle.
Brilliant, no doubt, yet somehow cut off from the world, shows little emotion -- kind of like Spock from "Star Trek," you know? This guy.
(Laughter)
Let's try and do the Spock salute.
I don't think I'll succeed ... See, I can't be Spock.
Thank goodness I can't be Spock.
(Laughter)
I was reminded of this distinction because a recent article came out in a very reputed scientific journal, which kind of characterized our Flint work as driven by "youthful idealism," and "Hollywood's dramatic sensibilities." It asks scientists to protect their research funding and institutions at all costs, no matter how just the cause.
And if you think you have to get involved in something, even if it's an emergency, try finding an activist group or an NGO, and obtain the full support of the academic community -- whatever that means -- before you get involved.
Not one mention of our moral and professional obligation of preventing harm to the public, or the fact that we have all this expertise, resources and, for some, even tenure to, you know, accomplish this task.
I'm not saying every scientist should be an activist.
There are real and sometimes very painful consequences of speaking up.
But to denounce this idea, this possibility so completely so that you can protect research funding, simply screams of self-serving cowardice, and these are not the ideals we would want to pass to our students.
And so you may think, "OK, all this sounds great, but you'll never completely change organizational cultures, or imbibe mindsets in students and professionals to look at their work as a public good -- science in service to the public." Maybe so.
But could a big reason for that be that we are not training our students right?
Because if you look closely, our education system today is focused more on creating what ex-Yale professor Bill Deresiewicz calls "excellent sheep" -- young people who are smart and ambitious, and yet somehow risk-averse, timid, directionless and, sometimes, full of themselves.
Now, kids... you know, we fell in love with science when we were kids, and yet we somehow spend most of our time during high school and college just jumping through hoops and doing things so that we can polish our résumé instead of sitting down and reflecting on what we want to do and who we want to be.
And so, the markers of empathy in our college graduates have been dropping dramatically in the past two decades, while those of narcissism are on the rise.
There is also a growing culture of disengagement between engineering students and the public.
We are trained to build bridges and solve complex problems but not how to think or live or be a citizen of this world.
My undergraduate years were explicit job preparation, and I cannot tell you how suffocating and painful it was at times.
Maybe so. And so, some people think the solution to great engineers, to great scientists, is more technical training. But where are the discussions on ethical decision-making, or building character, or discerning right from wrong?
Consider this project that I deeply love and admire.
It's called, "Heroic Imagination Project." A brainchild of Dr. Phil Zimbardo, famous for the Stanford Prison Experiment, this program seeks to train school-going children around the world to look at themselves as heroes-in-waiting, or heroes-in-training.
So, these young minds work over time to develop skills and virtues so that when the opportunity comes, no matter what that opportunity be, to stand up and do the right thing.
In other words, anyone can be a hero.
Think about that idea for a second.
Why don't we teach science and engineering like that -- where heroism and public service are seen as key values, because indeed, it's often heroism that is not only the antidote to public indifference, but also to systemic evil like we saw in Flint.
And so, dream with me what a 21st-century scientist slash engineer could look like: individuals who are driven to master the sciences so that they can serve society, and are also aware of the tremendous power their knowledge and decisions have; folks who are developing their moral courage at all times, and who realize that conflict and controversy are not necessarily bad things if our ultimate loyalty is to the public and the planet.
These are the people who will stand up like we did in Flint -- not to be saviors or heroes in the media, but altruistic and fundamentally good actors that you and I can trust.
Imagine fostering such a public-focused mindset in classes, on service trips and during activities during college or even high school, so that these young minds will hold onto those ideals when they actually enter the real world, whether that be consulting, academia, policy making -- or even becoming the president of a country.
Some of mankind's greatest challenges lie ahead of us; contaminated drinking water is just one example.
We could definitely use more -- nay, we desperately need more -- compassionate upstanders and public-focused scientists and engineers who will strive to the do right thing, and not be easy to manage.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Last year ... was hell.
(Laughter)
It was my first time eating Nigerian "jollof."
(Laughter)
Actually, in all seriousness, I was going through a lot of personal turmoil.
Faced with enormous stress, I suffered an anxiety attack.
On some days, I could do no work.
On other days, I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.
My doctor asked if I'd like to speak with a mental health professional about my stress and anxiety. Mental health? I clammed up and violently shook my head in protest.
I felt a profound sense of a shame.
I felt the weight of stigma.
I have a loving, supportive family and incredibly loyal friends, yet I could not entertain the idea of speaking to anyone about my feeling of pain.
I felt suffocated by the rigid architecture of our African masculinity. "People have real problems, Sangu. Get over yourself!"
The first time I heard "mental health," I was a boarding school student fresh off the boat from Ghana, at the Peddie School in New Jersey.
I had just gone through the brutal experience of losing seven loved ones in the same month.
The school nurse, concerned about what I'd gone through -- God bless her soul -- she inquired about my mental health. "Is she mental?" I thought.
Does she not know I'm an African man?
(Laughter)
Like Okonkwo in "Things Fall Apart," we African men neither process nor express our emotions.
We deal with our problems.
(Applause)
We deal with our problems.
I called my brother and laughed about "Oyibo" people -- white people -- and their strange diseases -- depression, ADD and those "weird things." Growing up in West Africa, when people used the term "mental," what came to mind was a madman with dirty, dread-locked hair, bumbling around half-naked on the streets.
We all know this man.
Our parents warned us about him. "Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?" "Drugs!
If you even look at drugs, you end up like him."
(Laughter)
Come down with pneumonia, and your mother will rush you to the nearest hospital for medical treatment.
But dare to declare depression, and your local pastor will be driving out demons and blaming witches in your village.
According to the World Health Organization, mental health is about being able to cope with the normal stressors of life; to work productively and fruitfully; and to be able to make a contribution to your community.
Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being.
Globally, 75 percent of all mental illness cases can be found in low-income countries.
Yet most African governments invest less than one percent of their health care budget in mental health.
Even worse, we have a severe shortage of psychiatrists in Africa.
Nigeria, for example, is estimated to have 200 -- in a country of almost 200 million.
In all of Africa, 90 percent of our people lack access to treatment.
As a result, we suffer in solitude, silenced by stigma.
We as Africans often respond to mental health with distance, ignorance, guilt, fear and anger.
In a study conducted by Arboleda-Flórez, directly asking, "What is the cause of mental illness?" 34 percent of Nigerian respondents cited drug misuse; 19 percent said divine wrath and the will of God --
(Laughter)
12 percent, witchcraft and spiritual possession.
But few cited other known causes of mental illness, like genetics, socioeconomic status, war, conflict or the loss of a loved one.
The stigmatization against mental illness often results in the ostracizing and demonizing of sufferers.
Photojournalist Robin Hammond has documented some of these abuses ... in Uganda, in Somalia, and here in Nigeria.
For me, the stigma is personal.
In 2009, I received a frantic call in the middle of the night.
My best friend in the world -- a brilliant, philosophical, charming, hip young man -- was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
I witnessed some of the friends we'd grown up with recoil.
I heard the snickers.
I heard the whispers. "Did you hear he has gone mad?" (Kru English) "He has gone crazy!" Derogatory, demeaning commentary about his condition — words we would never say about someone with cancer or someone with malaria.
Somehow, when it comes to mental illness, our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.
I stood by his side as his community isolated him, but our love never wavered.
Tacitly, I became passionate about mental health.
Inspired by his plight, I helped found the mental health special interest alumni group at my college.
And during my tenure as a resident tutor in graduate school, I supported many undergraduates with their mental health challenges.
I saw African students struggle and unable to speak to anyone.
Even with this knowledge and with their stories in tow, I, in turn, struggled, and could not speak to anyone when I faced my own anxiety, so deep is our fear of being the madman.
All of us -- but we Africans especially -- need to realize that our mental struggles do not detract from our virility, nor does our trauma taint our strength.
We need to see mental health as important as physical health.
We need to stop suffering in silence.
We must stop stigmatizing disease and traumatizing the afflicted.
Talk to your friends. Talk to your loved ones.
Talk to health professionals. Be vulnerable. Do so with the confidence that you are not alone.
Speak up if you're struggling.
Being honest about how we feel does not make us weak; it makes us human.
It is time to end the stigma associated with mental illness.
So the next time your hear "mental," do not just think of the madman. Think of me.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I was 14 years old inside of a bowling alley, burglarizing an arcade game, and upon exiting the building a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.
I ran down the street, and I jumped on top of a fence.
And when I got to the top, the weight of 3,000 quarters in my book bag pulled me back down to the ground.
So when I came to, the security guard was standing on top of me, and he said, "Next time you little punks steal something you can carry."
(Laughter) I was taken to juvenile hall and when I was released into the custody of my mother, the first words my uncle said was, "How'd you get caught?" I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy." He said, "Man, you weren't supposed to take all the quarters." I said, "Man, they were small.
What am I supposed to do? "And 10 minutes later, he took me to burglarize another arcade game.
We needed gas money to get home.
That was my life.
I grew up in Oakland, California, with my mother and members of my immediate family addicted to crack cocaine.
My environment consisted of living with family, friends, and homeless shelters.
Oftentimes, dinner was served in breadlines and soup kitchens.
The big homey told me this: money rules the world and everything in it.
And in these streets, money is king.
And if you follow the money, it'll lead you to the bad guy or the good guy.
Soon after, I committed my first crime, and it was the first time that I was told that I had potential and felt like somebody believed in me.
Nobody ever told me that I could be a lawyer, doctor or engineer.
I mean, how was I supposed to do that?
I was illiterate. So I always thought crime was my way to go. I couldn't read, write or spell.
And then one day I was talking to somebody and he was telling me about this robbery that we could do.
And we did it.
The reality was that I was growing up in the strongest financial nation in the world, the United States of America, while I watched my mother stand in line at a blood bank to sell her blood for 40 dollars just to try to feed her kids.
She still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that.
So I never cared about my community.
They didn't care about my life.
Everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted, the drug dealers, the robbers, the blood bank.
Everybody was taking blood money.
So I got mine by any means necessary. I got mine. Financial literacy really did rule the world, and I was a child slave to it following the bad guy.
At 17 years old, I was arrested for robbery and murder and I soon learned that finances in prison rule more than they did on the streets, so I wanted in.
One day, I rushed to grab the sports page of the newspaper so my cellie could read it to me, and I accidentally picked up the business section.
(Laughter) And this old man said, "Hey youngster, you pick stocks?" And I said, "What's that?" He said, "That's the place where white folks keep all their money."
And it was the first time that I saw a glimpse of hope, a future. He gave me this brief description of what stocks were, but it was just a glimpse.
I mean, how was I supposed to do it?
I couldn't read, write or spell.
The skills that I had developed to hide my illiteracy no longer worked in this environment.
I was trapped in a cage, prey among predators, fighting for freedom I never had.
I was lost, tired, and I was out of options.
So at 20 years old, I did the hardest thing I'd ever done in my life.
I picked up a book, and it was the most agonizing time of my life, trying to learn how to read, the ostracizing from my family, the homeys.
It was rough, man.
It was a struggle.
But little did I know I was receiving the greatest gifts I had ever dreamed of: self-worth, knowledge, discipline.
I was so excited to be reading that I read everything I could get my hands on: candy wrappers, clothing logos, street signs, everything.
I was just reading stuff! (Applause)
Just reading stuff. I was so excited to know how to read and know how to spell.
The homey came up, said, "Man, what you eating?" I said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy." (Laughter)
(Laughter) He said, "Let me get some." I said, "N-O. No."
It was awesome. I mean, I can actually now for the first time in my life read.
The feeling that I got from it was amazing.
And then at 22, feeling myself, feeling confident, I remembered what the OG told me.
So I picked up the business section of the newspaper.
(Laughter) I wanted to find these rich white folks. So I looked for that glimpse.
As I furthered my career in teaching others how to financially manage money and invest, I soon learned that I had to take responsibility for my own actions.
True, I grew up in a very complex environment, but I chose to commit crimes, and I had to own up to that.
I had to take responsibility for that, and I did.
I was building a curriculum that could teach incarcerated men how to manage money through prison employments.
Properly managing our lifestyle would provide transferrable tools that we can use to manage money when we reenter society, like the majority of people did who didn't commit crimes.
Then I discovered that according to MarketWatch, over 60 percent of the American population has under 1,000 dollars in savings.
Sports Illustrated said that over 60 percent of NBA players and NFL players go broke.
40 percent of marital problems derive from financial issues. What the hell?
(Laughter) You mean to tell me that people worked their whole lives, buying cars, clothes, homes and material stuff but were living check to check?
How in the world were members of society going to help incarcerated individuals back into society if they couldn't manage they own stuff? We screwed.
(Laughter) I needed a better plan.
This is not going to work out too well.
So... I thought.
I now had an obligation to meet those on the path and help, and it was crazy because I now cared about my community.
Wow, imagine that.
I cared about my community.
Financial illiteracy is a disease that has crippled minorities and the lower class in our society for generations and generations, and we should be furious about that.
Ask yourselves this: How can 50 percent of the American population be financially illiterate in a nation driven by financial prosperity?
Our access to justice, our social status, living conditions, transportation and food are all dependent on money that most people can't manage. It's crazy! It's an epidemic and a bigger danger to public safety than any other issue.
According to the California Department of Corrections, over 70 percent of those incarcerated have committed or have been charged with money-related crimes: robberies, burglaries, fraud, larceny, extortion — and the list goes on.
Check this out: a typical incarcerated person would enter the California prison system with no financial education, earn 30 cents an hour, over 800 dollars a year, with no real expenses and save no money.
Upon his parole, he will be given 200 dollars gate money and told, "Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble.
Don't come back to prison. "With no meaningful preparation or long-term financial plan, what does he do...? At 60? Get a good job, or go back to the very criminal behavior that led him to prison in the first place?
You taxpayers, you choose.
Well, his education already chose for him, probably.
So how do we cure this disease?
I cofounded a program that we call Financial Empowerment Emotional Literacy.
We call it FEEL, and it teaches how do you separate your emotional decisions from your financial decisions, and the four timeless rules to personal finance: the proper way to save, control your cost of living, borrow money effectively and diversify your finances by allowing your money to work for you instead of you working for it.
Incarcerated people need these life skills before we reenter society.
You can't have full rehabilitation without these life skills.
(Applause) This idea that only professionals can invest and manage money is absolutely ridiculous, and whoever told you that is lying.
A professional is a person who knows his craft better than most, and nobody knows how much money you need, have or want better than you, which means you are the professional.
Financial literacy is not a skill, ladies and gentlemen. It's a lifestyle.
Financial stability is a byproduct of a proper lifestyle.
A financially sound incarcerated person can become a taxpaying citizen, and a financially sound taxpaying citizen can remain one.
This allows us to create a bridge between those people who we influence: family, friends and those young people who still believe that crime and money are related.
So let's lose the fear and anxiety of all the big financial words and all that other nonsense that you've been out there hearing.
And let's get to the heart of what's been crippling our society from taking care of your responsibility to be better life managers.
And let's provide a simple and easy to use curriculum that gets to the heart, the heart of what financial empowerment and emotional literacy really is.
(Laughter) Now, if you're sitting out here in the audience and you said, "Oh yeah, well, that ain't me and I don't buy it," then come take my class --
(Applause) Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)
As patients, we usually remember the names of our doctors, but often we forget the names of our nurses. I remember one. I had breast cancer a few years ago, and somehow I managed to get through the surgeries and the beginning of the treatment just fine.
I could hide what was going on.
Everybody didn't really have to know.
I could walk my daughter to school, I could go out to dinner with my husband; I could fool people.
But then my chemo was scheduled to begin and that terrified me because I knew that I was going to lose every single hair on my body because of the kind of chemo that I was going to have.
I wasn't going to be able to pretend anymore as though everything was normal.
I was scared. I knew what it felt like to have everybody treating me with kid gloves, and I just wanted to feel normal.
I had a port installed in my chest.
I went to my first day of chemotherapy, and I was an emotional wreck.
My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door, and every bone in my body was telling me to get up out of that chair and take for the hills.
But Joanne looked at me and talked to me like we were old friends.
And then she asked me, "Where'd you get your highlights done?"
(Laughter)
And I was like, are you kidding me?
You're going to talk to me about my hair when I'm on the verge of losing it? I was kind of angry, and I said, "Really? Hair?" And with a shrug of her shoulders she said, "It's gonna grow back." And in that moment she said the one thing I had overlooked, and that was that at some point, my life would get back to normal.
She really believed that.
And so I believed it, too.
Now, worrying about losing your hair when you're fighting cancer may seem silly at first, but it's not just that you're worried about how you're going to look.
It's that you're worried that everybody's going to treat you so carefully.
Joanne made me feel normal for the first time in six months.
We talked about her boyfriends, we talked about looking for apartments in New York City, and we talked about my reaction to the chemotherapy -- all kind of mixed in together.
And I always wondered, how did she so instinctively know just how to talk to me?
Joanne Staha and my admiration for her marked the beginning of my journey into the world of nurses.
A few years later, I was asked to do a project that would celebrate the work that nurses do.
I started with Joanne, and I met over 100 nurses across the country.
I spent five years interviewing, photographing and filming nurses for a book and a documentary film.
With my team, we mapped a trip across America that would take us to places dealing with some of the biggest public health issues facing our nation -- aging, war, poverty, prisons.
And then we went places where we would find the largest concentration of patients dealing with those issues.
Then we asked hospitals and facilities to nominate nurses who would best represent them.
One of the first nurses I met was Bridget Kumbella.
Bridget was born in Cameroon, the oldest of four children.
Her father was at work when he had fallen from the fourth floor and really hurt his back.
And he talked a lot about what it was like to be flat on your back and not get the kind of care that you need.
And that propelled Bridget to go into the profession of nursing.
Now, as a nurse in the Bronx, she has a really diverse group of patients that she cares for, from all walks of life, and from all different religions.
And she's devoted her career to understanding the impact of our cultural differences when it comes to our health.
She spoke of a patient -- a Native American patient that she had -- that wanted to bring a bunch of feathers into the ICU.
That's how he found spiritual comfort.
And she spoke of advocating for him and said that patients come from all different religions and use all different kinds of objects for comfort; whether it's a holy rosary or a symbolic feather, it all needs to be supported.
This is Jason Short. Jason is a home health nurse in the Appalachian mountains, and his dad had a gas station and a repair shop when he was growing up.
So he worked on cars in the community that he now serves as a nurse.
When he was in college, it was just not macho at all to become a nurse, so he avoided it for years.
He drove trucks for a little while, but his life path was always pulling him back to nursing.
As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains, Jason goes places that an ambulance can't even get to.
In this photograph, he's standing in what used to be a road.
Top of the mountain mining flooded that road, and now the only way for Jason to get to the patient living in that house with black lung disease is to drive his SUV against the current up that creek.
The day I was with him, we ripped the front fender off the car.
The next morning he got up, put the car on the lift, fixed the fender, and then headed out to meet his next patient.
I witnessed Jason caring for this gentleman with such enormous compassion, and I was struck again by how intimate the work of nursing really is.
When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.
He had just come back from a deployment and he hadn't really settled back in to life in San Diego yet.
He talked about his experience of being a nurse in Germany and taking care of the soldiers coming right off the battlefield.
Very often, he would be the first person they would see when they opened their eyes in the hospital.
And they would look at him as they were lying there, missing limbs, and the first thing they would say is, "When can I go back?
I left my brothers out there. "And Brian would have to say," You're not going anywhere.
You've already given enough, brother." Brian is both a nurse and a soldier who's seen combat.
So that puts him in a unique position to be able to relate to and help heal the veterans in his care.
This is Sister Stephen, and she runs a nursing home in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.
And the entire circle of life can be found under her roof.
She grew up wishing they lived on a farm, so given the opportunity to adopt local farm animals, she enthusiastically brings them in.
And in the springtime, those animals have babies. And Sister Stephen uses those baby ducks, goats and lambs as animal therapy for the residents at Villa Loretto who sometimes can't remember their own name, but they do rejoice in the holding of a baby lamb.
The day I was with Sister Stephen, I needed to take her away from Villa Loretto to film part of her story.
And before we left, she went into the room of a dying patient.
And she leaned over and she said, "I have to go away for the day, but if Jesus calls you, you go.
You go straight home to Jesus." I was standing there and thinking it was the first time in my life I witnessed that you could show someone you love them completely by letting go.
We don't have to hold on so tightly.
I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto than I have ever seen at any other time at any other place in my life.
We live in a complicated time when it comes to our health care.
It's easy to lose sight of the need for quality of life, not just quantity of life.
As new life-saving technologies are created, we're going to have really complicated decisions to make.
These technologies often save lives, but they can also prolong pain and the dying process.
How in the world are we supposed to navigate these waters?
We're going to need all the help we can get.
Nurses have a really unique relationship with us because of the time spent at bedside.
During that time, a kind of emotional intimacy develops.
This past summer, on August 9, my father died of a heart attack.
My mother was devastated, and she couldn't imagine her world without him in it.
Four days later she fell, she broke her hip, she needed surgery and she found herself fighting for her own life.
Once again I found myself on the receiving end of the care of nurses -- this time for my mom.
My brother and my sister and I stayed by her side for the next three days in the ICU.
And as we tried to make the right decisions and follow my mother's wishes, we found that we were depending upon the guidance of nurses.
And once again, they didn't let us down.
They had an amazing insight in terms of how to care for my mom in the last four days of her life.
They brought her comfort and relief from pain.
They knew to encourage my sister and I to put a pretty nightgown on my mom, long after it mattered to her, but it sure meant a lot to us.
And they knew to come and wake me up just in time for my mom's last breath.
And then they knew how long to leave me in the room with my mother after she died.
I have no idea how they know these things, but I do know that I am eternally grateful that they've guided me once again.
Thank you so very much.
(Applause)
So there's this thing called the law of unintended consequences.
I thought it was just like a saying, but it actually exists, I guess.
There's, like, academic papers about it.
And I'm a designer.
I don't like unintended consequences.
People hire me because they have consequences that they really intend, and what they intend is for me to help them achieve those consequences.
So I live in fear of unintended consequences.
And so this is a story about consequences intended and unintended.
I got called by an organization called Robin Hood to do a favor for them.
Robin Hood is based in New York, a wonderful philanthropic organization that does what it says in the name. They take from rich people, give it to poor people.
In this case, what they wanted to benefit was the New York City school system, a huge enterprise that educates more than a million students at a time, and in buildings that are like this one, old buildings, big buildings, drafty buildings, sometimes buildings that are in disrepair, certainly buildings that could use a renovation.
Robin Hood had this ambition to improve these buildings in some way, but what they realized was to fix the buildings would be too expensive and impractical.
So instead they tried to figure out what one room they could go into in each of these buildings, in as many buildings that they could, and fix that one room so that they could improve the lives of the children inside as they were studying.
And what they came up with was the school library, and they came up with this idea called the Library Initiative.
All the students have to pass through the library.
That's where the books are. That's where the heart and soul of the school is.
So let's fix these libraries.
So they did this wonderful thing where they brought in first 10, then 20, then more architects, each one of whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was.
They trained special librarians.
So they started this mighty enterprise to reform public schools by improving these libraries.
Then they called me up and they said, "Could you make a little contribution?" I said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?" And they said, "Well, we want you to be the graphic designer in charge of the whole thing." And so I thought, I know what that means.
That means I get to design a logo.
I know how to design that. I design logos. That's what people come to me for.
So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.
Easy to do, actually, compared with architecture and being a librarian.
Just do a logo, make a contribution, and then you're out, and you feel really good about yourself.
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel good about myself when I do these favors.
So I thought, let's overdeliver.
I'm going to give you three logos, all based on this one idea.
So you have three options, pick any of the three.
They're all great, I said.
So the basic idea was these would be new school libraries for New York schools, and so the idea is that it's a new thing, a new idea that needs a new name.
What I wanted to do was dispel the idea that these were musty old libraries, the kind of places that everyone is bored with, you know, not your grandparents' library.
Don't worry about that at all. This is going to this new, exciting thing, not a boring library.
So option number one: so instead of thinking of it as a library, think of it as a place where it is like: do talk, do make loud noises. Right? So no shushing, it's like a shush-free zone.
We're going to call it the Reading Room.
That was option number one.
OK, option number two. Option number two was, wait for it, OWL. I'll meet you at OWL.
I'm getting my book from the OWL.
Meet you after school down at OWL. I like that, right?
Now, what does OWL stand for?
Well, it could be One World Library, or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn. Or it could be -- and I figure librarians could figure out other things it could be because they know about words. So other things, right?
And then look at this. It's like the eye of the owl. This is irresistible in my opinion.
But there's even another idea. Option number three. Option number three was based actually on language.
It's the idea that "read" is the past tense of "read," and they're both spelled the same way.
So why don't we call this place The Red Zone? I'll meet you at the Red Zone. Are you Red? Get Red. I'm well Red. (Laughter)
I really loved this idea, and I somehow was not focused on the idea that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and I don't know.
(Laughter)
But sometimes cleverness is more important than spelling, and I thought this would be one of those instances.
So usually when I make these presentations I say there's just one question and the question should be, "How can I thank you, Mike?" But in this case, the question was more like, "Um, are you kidding?" Because, they said, the premise of all this work was that kids were bored with old libraries, musty old libraries. They were tired of them.
And instead, they said, these kids have never really seen a library.
The school libraries in these schools are really so dilapidated, if they're there at all, that they haven't bored anyone.
They haven't even been there to bore anyone at all.
So the idea was, just forget about giving it a new name.
Just call it, one last try, a library. Right? OK. So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph? Exclamation point? Then -- this is because I'm clever -- move that into the "i," make it red, and there you have it, the Library Initiative.
So I thought, mission accomplished, there's your logo.
So what's interesting about this logo, an unintended consequence, was that it turned out that they didn't really even need my design because you could type it any font, you could write it by hand, and when they started sending emails around, they just would use Shift and 1, they'd get their own logo just right out of the thing.
And I thought, well, that's fine.
Feel free to use that logo. And then I embarked on the real rollout of this thing -- working with every one of the architects to put this logo on the front door of their own library. Right?
So here's the big rollout. Basically I'd work with different architects.
First Robin Hood was my client. Now these architects were my client.
Put it on both doors. "" Here's your logo. Put it off to the side. "" Here's your logo repeated all over to the top. "So everything was going swimmingly.
I just was saying, "Here's your logo. Here's your logo."
Then I got a call from one of the architects, a guy named Richard Lewis, and he says, "I've got a problem. You're the graphics guy.
Can you solve it? "And I said, OK, sure." And he said, "The problem is that there's a space between the shelf and the ceiling." So that sounds like an architectural issue to me, not a graphic design issue, so I'm, "Go on." And Richard says, "Well, the top shelf has to be low enough for the kid to reach it, but I'm in a big old building, and the ceilings are really high, so actually I've got all this space up there and I need something like a mural." And I'm like, "Whoa, you know, I'm a logo designer.
I'm not Diego Rivera or something.
I'm not a muralist. "And so he said," But can't you think of anything? "So I said," OK, what if we just took pictures of the kids in the school and just put them around the top of the thing, and maybe that could work. "And my wife is a photographer, and I said," Dorothy, there's no budget, can you come to this school in east New York, take these pictures? "And she did, and if you go in Richard's library, which is one of the first that opened, it has this glorious frieze of, like, the heroes of the school, oversized, looking down into the little dollhouse of the real library, right?
And the kids were great, hand-selected by the principals and the librarian.
It just kind of created this heroic atmosphere in this library, this very dignified setting below and the joy of the children above.
So naturally all the other librarians in the other schools see this and they said, well, we want murals too.
And I'm like, OK.
So then I think, well, it can't be the same mural every time, so Dorothy did another one, and then she did another one, but then we needed more help, so I called an illustrator I knew named Lynn Pauley, and Lynn did these beautiful paintings of the kids.
Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin at a place called Automatic Design.
He did these amazing collages. We had Rafael Esquer do these great silhouettes.
He would work with the kids, asking for words, and then based on those prompts, come up with this little, delirious kind of constellation of silhouettes of things that are in books.
Peter Arkle interviewed the kids and had them talk about their favorite books and he put their testimony as a frieze up there.
Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu and they did this amazing manga-style statement, "Everyone who is honest is interesting," that goes all the way around.
Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator, did a whole series of things where he embedded books into the faces and characters and images and places that you find in the books.
And then even Maira Kalman did this amazing cryptic installation of objects and words that kind of go all around and will fascinate students for as long as it's up there.
So this was really satisfying, and basically my role here was reading a series of dimensions to these artists, and I would say, "Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want.
Let me know if you have any problem with that. "And they would go and install these.
It just was the greatest thing.
But the greatest thing, actually, was -- Every once in a while, I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail made of construction paper, and it would say, "You are invited to the opening of our new library." So you'd go to the library, say, you'd go to PS10, and you'd go inside.
There'd be balloons, there'd be a student ambassador, there'd be speeches that were read, poetry that was written specifically for the opening, dignitaries would present people with certificates, and the whole thing was just a delirious, fun party.
So I loved going to these things.
I would stand there dressed like this, obviously not belonging, and someone would say, "What are you doing here, mister?" And I'd say, "Well, I'm part of the team that designed this place." And they'd said, "You do these shelves?" And I said, "No." "You took the pictures up above." "No." "Well, what did you do?" "You know when you came in? The sign over the door?" "The sign that says library?"
(Laughter)
"Yeah, I did that!" And then they'd sort of go, "OK.
Nice work if you can get it. "So it was so satisfying going to these little openings despite the fact that I was kind of largely ignored or humiliated, but it was actually fun going to the openings, so I decided that I wanted to get the people in my office who had worked on these projects, get the illustrators and photographers, and I said, why don't we rent a van and drive around the five boroughs of New York and see how many we could hit at one time.
And eventually there were going to be 60 of these libraries, so we probably got to see maybe half a dozen in one long day.
And the best thing of all was meeting these librarians who kind of were running these, took possession of these places like their private stage upon which they were invited to mesmerize their students and bring the books to life, and it was just this really exciting experience for all of us to actually see these things in action.
So we spent a long day doing this and we were in the very last library.
It was still winter, because it got dark early, and the librarian says, "I'm about to close down.
So really nice having you here.
Hey, wait a second, do you want to see how I turn off the lights? "I'm like," OK. "And she said," I have this special way that I do it. "And then she showed me.
What she did was she turned out every light one by one by one by one, and the last light she left on was the light that illuminated the kids' faces, and she said, "That's the last light I turn off every night, because I like to remind myself why I come to work."
So when I started this whole thing, remember, it was just about designing that logo and being clever, come up with a new name?
The unintended consequence here, which I would like to take credit for and like to think I can think through the experience to that extent, but I can't.
I was just focused on a foot ahead of me, as far as I could reach with my own hands.
Instead, way off in the distance was a librarian who was going to find the chain of consequences that we had set in motion, a source of inspiration so that she in this case could do her work really well.
40,000 kids a year are affected by these libraries.
They've been happening for more than 10 years now, so those librarians have kind of turned on a generation of children to books and so it's been a thrill to find out that sometimes unintended consequences are the best consequences.
Thank you very much.
I come to you today to speak of liars, lawsuits and laughter.
The first time I heard about Holocaust denial, I laughed. Holocaust denial? The Holocaust which has the dubious distinction of being the best-documented genocide in the world?
Who could believe it didn't happen?
Think about it. For deniers to be right, who would have to be wrong?
Well, first of all, the victims -- the survivors who have told us their harrowing stories.
Who else would have to be wrong? The bystanders. The people who lived in the myriads of towns and villages and cities on the Eastern front, who watched their neighbors be rounded up -- men, women, children, young, old -- and be marched to the outskirts of the town to be shot and left dead in ditches.
Or the Poles, who lived in towns and villages around the death camps, who watched day after day as the trains went in filled with people and came out empty.
But above all, who would have to be wrong? The perpetrators. The people who say, "We did it.
I did it." Now, maybe they add a caveat.
They say, "I didn't have a choice; I was forced to do it." But nonetheless, they say, "I did it." Think about it.
In not one war crimes trial since the end of World War II has a perpetrator of any nationality ever said, "It didn't happen." Again, they may have said, "I was forced," but never that it didn't happen.
Having thought that through, I decided denial was not going to be on my agenda; I had bigger things to worry about, to write about, to research, and I moved on.
Fast-forward a little over a decade, and two senior scholars -- two of the most prominent historians of the Holocaust -- approached me and said, "Deborah, let's have coffee.
We have a research idea that we think is perfect for you. "Intrigued and flattered that they came to me with an idea and thought me worthy of it, I asked," What is it? "And they said," Holocaust denial. "And for the second time, I laughed. Holocaust denial? The Flat Earth folks? The Elvis-is-alive people? I should study them?
And these two guys said, "Yeah, we're intrigued.
What are they about?
What's their objective?
How do they manage to get people to believe what they say?"
So thinking, if they thought it was worthwhile, I would take a momentary diversion -- maybe a year, maybe two, three, maybe even four -- in academic terms, that's momentary.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) We work very slowly.
And I would look at them. So I did. I did my research, and I came up with a number of things, two of which I'd like to share with you today.
One: deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.
They are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis -- you can decide whether you want to put a "neo" there or not.
But when I looked at them, I didn't see any SS-like uniforms, swastika-like symbols on the wall, Sieg Heil salutes -- none of that.
What I found instead were people parading as respectable academics.
What did they have? They had an institute.
An "Institute for Historical Review." They had a journal — a slick journal — a "Journal of Historical Review." One filled with papers — footnote-laden papers.
And they had a new name.
Not neo-Nazis, not anti-Semites -- revisionists.
They said, "We are revisionists. We are out to do one thing: to revise mistakes in history." But all you had to do was go one inch below the surface, and what did you find there? The same adulation of Hitler, praise of the Third Reich, anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.
This is what intrigued me.
It was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice, parading as rational discourse.
The other thing I found — many of us have been taught to think there are facts and there are opinions — after studying deniers, I think differently.
There are facts, there are opinions and there are lies.
And what deniers want to do is take their lies, dress them up as opinions -- maybe edgy opinions, maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions -- but then if they're opinions, they should be part of the conversation.
And then they encroach on the facts.
I published my work -- the book was published, "Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory," it came out in many different countries, including here in Penguin UK, and I was done with those folks and ready to move on.
Then came the letter from Penguin UK.
And for the third time, I laughed... mistakenly.
I opened the letter, and it informed me that David Irving was bringing a libel suit against me in the United Kingdom for calling him a Holocaust denier.
David Irving suing me? Who was David Irving?
David Irving was a writer of historical works, most of them about World War II, and virtually all of those works took the position that the Nazis were really not so bad, and the Allies were really not so good.
And the Jews, whatever happened to them, they sort of deserved it.
He knew the documents, he knew the facts, but he somehow twisted them to get this opinion.
He hadn't always been a Holocaust denier, but in the late '80s, he embraced it with great vigor.
The reason I laughed also was this was a man who not only was a Holocaust denier, but seemed quite proud of it.
Here was a man -- and I quote -- who said, "I'm going to sink the battleship Auschwitz." Here was a man who pointed to the number tattooed on a survivor's arm and said, "How much money have you made from having that number tattooed on your arm?" Here was a man who said, "More people died in Senator Kennedy's car at Chappaquiddick than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz." That's an American reference, but you can look it up.
This was not a man who seemed at all ashamed or reticent about being a Holocaust denier.
Now, lots of my academic colleagues counseled me -- "Eh, Deborah, just ignore it." When I explained you can't just ignore a libel suit, they said, "Who's going to believe him anyway?" But here was the problem: British law put the onus, put the burden of proof on me to prove the truth of what I said, in contrast to as it would have been in the United States and in many other countries: on him to prove the falsehood.
What did that mean? That meant if I didn't fight, he would win by default.
And if he won by default, he could then legitimately say, "My David Irving version of the Holocaust is a legitimate version. Deborah Lipstadt was found to have libeled me when she called me a Holocaust denier.
Ipso facto, I, David Irving, am not a Holocaust denier." And what is that version?
There was no plan to murder the Jews, there were no gas chambers, there were no mass shootings, Hitler had nothing to do with any suffering that went on, and the Jews have made this all up to get money from Germany and to get a state, and they've done it with the aid and abettance of the Allies — they've planted the documents and planted the evidence.
I couldn't let that stand and ever face a survivor or a child of survivors.
I couldn't let that stand and consider myself a responsible historian. So we fought. And for those of you who haven't seen "Denial," spoiler alert: we won.
(Laughter)
(Applause) The judge found David Irving to be a liar, a racist, an anti-Semite. His view of history was tendentious, he lied, he distorted -- and most importantly, he did it deliberately.
We showed a pattern, in over 25 different major instances.
(Laughter) Not small things -- many of us in this audience write books, are writing books; we always make mistakes, that's why we're glad to have second editions: correct the mistakes.
And what did we find? Not in most cases, and not in the preponderance of cases, but in every single instance where he made some reference to the Holocaust, that his supposed evidence was distorted, half-truth, date-changed, sequence-changed, someone put at a meeting who wasn't there.
In other words, he didn't have the evidence. His evidence didn't prove it.
We didn't prove what happened.
We proved that what he said happened -- and by extension, all deniers, because he either quotes them or they get their arguments from him -- is not true.
What they claim -- they don't have the evidence to prove it.
So why is my story more than just the story of a quirky, long, six-year, difficult lawsuit, an American professor being dragged into a courtroom by a man that the court declared in its judgment was a neo-Nazi polemicist?
What message does it have?
I think in the context of the question of truth, it has a very significant message.
Because today, as we well know, truth and facts are under assault.
Social media, for all the gifts it has given us, has also allowed the difference between facts -- established facts -- and lies to be flattened.
Third of all: extremism.
You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes, you may not see burning crosses, you may not even hear outright white supremacist language. It may go by names: "alt-right," "National Front" — pick your names. But underneath, it's that same extremism that I found in Holocaust denial parading as rational discourse.
We live in an age where truth is on the defensive.
I'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.
A quiz show recently appeared in "The New Yorker" where the host of the quiz show is saying to one of the contestants, "Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer. But your opponent yelled more loudly than you did, so he gets the point."
What can we do? First of all, we cannot be beguiled by rational appearances.
We've got to look underneath, and we will find there the extremism.
Second of all, we must understand that truth is not relative.
Number three, we must go on the offensive, not the defensive.
When someone makes an outrageous claim, even though they may hold one of the highest offices in the land, if not the world -- we must say to them, "Where's the proof?
Where's the evidence?" We must hold their feet to the fire.
We must not treat it as if their lies are the same as the facts.
And as I said earlier, truth is not relative.
Many of us have grown up in the world of the academy and enlightened liberal thought, where we're taught everything is open to debate. But that's not the case.
There are certain things that are true.
There are indisputable facts -- objective truths.
Galileo taught it to us centuries ago.
Even after being forced to recant by the Vatican that the Earth moved around the Sun, he came out, and what is he reported to have said? "And yet, it still moves." The Earth is not flat.
The climate is changing.
(Laughter) (Applause) Elvis is not alive. And most importantly, truth and fact are under assault.
The job ahead of us, the task ahead of us, the challenge ahead of us is great.
The time to fight is short.
We must act now.
Later will be too late.
(Applause) Thank you very much.
Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams, or should we say, have a seat, mom.
(Cheers)
So no doubt, you guys are like me.
You saw the release of Serena in that great yellow bathing suit last week and when I saw it, all I could think of was, "Gosh, why couldn't she have waited til we sat onstage for TED?" I was very selfish, I know.
So I asked you about that picture, and you said nobody was supposed to see that picture.
What do you mean? Serena Williams: Well, actually, it was an accident.
I was on vacation, just taking some time for myself, and I have this thing where I've been checking my status and taking pictures every week to see how far along I'm going --
GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe?
SW: No, actually I have just been saving it, and I didn't really tell a lot of people, to be quite honest, and I'd been saving it, and you know how social media is, you press the wrong button and --
(Laughter)
GK: And there it was.
SW: So 30 minutes later -- my phone doesn't ring that much -- and 30 minutes later, I missed like four calls, and I'm like, that's weird, and then I picked it up and I was like, oh no.
But it was a good moment.
I was gonna wait literally just five or six more days -- that's OK.
GK: I know, because it was weird, Serena, because it only said 20 weeks, so it's not like there was a whole lot of information on it.
SW: Exactly, so that's what I've been doing all this time. I've been just tracking it.
18, 19 -- every week I'd just take a picture and save it, and I've been so good about it, and this was the one time that I slipped.
GK: There you go. Well, congratulations.
SW: Yes, thank you.
GK: It really is OK. When you heard the news, were you excited? Were you afraid? Were you worried? That you were pregnant, I mean.
SW: So I heard it two days before the beginning of the Australian Open, which is one of the biggest grand slams.
GK: You found out two days before?
SW: Yeah, so it was two days before, and I knew. I was nervous. I wasn't quite sure what to think, but I just knew that at that moment it was really important for me to just focus right there at the Australian Open, and I was definitely not sure what to do.
I was like, can I play?
I know it's very dangerous, maybe, sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so, so I had a lot of questions.
GK: But not only did you play, Ms. Williams, you won.
SW: Yeah. May I just say, 23 grand slams to you.
SW: Thank you.
(Applause) GK: While pregnant!
SW: Well, I was looking for another handicap, so... no.
GK: Did you play differently that game, knowing you were pregnant?
SW: I did. It wasn't very easy.
You hear all these stories about people when they're pregnant, they get sick and they get tired.
GK: Have you had morning sickness?
SW: No, I've been so fortunate and so I haven't.
But they get really tired and they get really stressed out, and I had to really take all that energy, put it in a paper bag, so to say, and throw it away, because I really felt like I didn't have time to deal with any extra emotions, any extra anything, because pregnant or not, no one knew, and I was supposed to win that tournament as I am every tournament that I show up.
I am expected to win, and if I don't win, it's actually much bigger news.
GK: Yeah, when you don't win, that's a big story.
SW: Yes, so for me, I had to really take anything negative and any emotions that I was feeling at that point and kind of just bottle them up and really figure out what the next step for me to do was.
GK: You have a lot of support. You have a lot of love.
Even when I was coming here, people stopped me at the airport.
I was saying to the flight attendant, the pilot, "Guess where I'm going?" They said, "Oh my God, we're so glad she's pregnant." But then you always have these cranky Yankees.
On the way over here, somebody was telling me about Ilie Nastase, who said some very unkind, inappropriate, dare I say racial things.
You have responded to him.
I'm not even going to dignify what he said, but you responded. Why did you respond?
SW: Well, I think there are very inappropriate comments, and not only that, I've been really supportive of my peers and the people that I've worked with.
I've been a pro for almost 20 years, and so for me, it's really important to hold women up, and it's something that these young women, they'll come to the locker room, they'll want to take pictures with me, and for me, it's just like, I want to be able to be a good leader and a good example for them. So not only —
Not only did he have rude things to say about me and my peers, I felt it was important for us to stand up for each other and to stand up for myself.
And at that point it was really important for me to say, like, I'm not afraid, I'm not going anywhere, but this is inappropriate, and there's time and there's a place for everything.
And that really wasn't the time and the place.
GK: We cut the part where you said you're not going anywhere, because you'll be 36 in September. Baby's coming, 36.
And your coach said age is always important, but in tennis it's very important, but he has no doubt that you're coming back.
Have you thought, am I coming back?
Will I take some time off?
I know the women on the tour are saying, "How long does it take to have a baby?
Two years will she be gone? "What are you thinking?
SW: Well, I'm always trying to defy the odds, you know, so for me everything is really mental.
I definitely plan on coming back.
I'm not done yet.
I'm really inspired by my sister.
She's a year older than me, and that's something that -- if she's still playing, I know I can play.
(Laughter)
And there's so many -- Roger Federer, he's a little bit older than me and he's still winning everything, so I'm like, I know I can do that too.
So that's been so inspiring to me, especially recently, and I know that it's something I want to do.
And my story is definitely not over yet.
I was talking to my coach about it, and we were talking about how this is just a new part of my life, and my baby's going to be in the stands and hopefully cheering for me, not crying too much.
GK: No, you wrote a beautiful letter to your baby yesterday that you said -- from the oldest mommy to the youngest one, to the oldest, to the youngest, I can't wait for you to get here. A lot of people feel that.
I saw you about a year ago, because I think about your life, Serena.
You've had three life-changing things in a six-month time: pregnant, huge win, fell in love.
And when I saw you last year, I was saying, "How's your love life?
Da da da. "You said," I met a guy. He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.
You won't know who he is." I said, "What's his name?"
SW: I remember talking to you about that, yes.
GK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian." I said, "I know him!" He's awesome.
But I would never put you with a nerdy geek, and you said, you neither.
SW: I'm going to be honest with you, I didn't either, but it's been the best thing for me.
GK: The best thing why? Does that look like a nerdy geek? Look at the shirt.
(Laughter)
No, he's a very nice guy.
SW: You can tell he's into technology.
GK: He's a very, very nice guy.
I like him very much.
So how did he succeed when others have failed?
How was he the one that you knew, this is the one for me?
SW: Well, I'm not going to say that, SW: Well ...
SW: Well ...
(Laughter)
GK: But you know what I mean.
SW: He is very loving and he's very kind, and my mom says he's very considerate, and when she said that to me, I was like, you know, he really is, and it's the little things that really make a huge difference in life.
GK: Like?
SW: Something simple. My fashion company, we have a show every year, so in our show last year, I was running around like crazy, because I do everything for the show, and everything for it, so I was running around like crazy, and he, it was a simple gesture of this shirt that he had, and he just wanted to make sure that I had the same one, and it was -- it's a weird story.
It was better in person, I promise.
GK: Was it a wonderful proposal?
Or was it a Beyoncé song? "If you like it then you ought to put a ring on it"?
Were you feeling pressure to get married? Did you know it was coming?
SW: Yeah, I actually never felt pressure to get married and I can't say I'm the marrying type of person.
I really love my life.
I love my freedom. I heard that kind of changes.
But I love everything that I do, and I love my career, and I always felt like I didn't want anything to interfere with that.
I've actually been so career-oriented and in fact, when he proposed, I was almost angry. Not almost. I was angry, because it was right in the middle of my training season, and I said, "I gotta win the Australian Open.
I can't fly to Rome. "Because he wanted to take me to Rome, and I said," I can't.
I gotta win. "But that's how focused I was.
GK: This is a girl that says, "No, I can't go to Rome." OK.
SW: But I was really focused on reaching my goals and I knew at that point there was one player that I wanted to pass.
I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record, and that really meant a lot to me, and when I put my mind to something, I really am determined to reach it no matter what.
GK: You know, you said that for you -- I've heard you say that winning is addictive to you.
SW: It is.
GK: What do you mean?
SW: I feel like winning for me is superaddictive.
I feel like once you experience it, you always want to get that feeling again, and when I won my first championship, I was only 17 years old, but I never forgot that feeling, and I feel like every time I win one, I want to reach that feeling of your first championship.
There's really no feeling in the world like that. And it's like, all these years of training and being a little kid and playing, and then winning is a wonderful experience.
So for me I've always felt like I loved that feeling, and obviously I don't like the feeling of losing. I feel like --
GK: No, in fact, people close to you say you're a very bad loser.
SW: I'm not the best loser.
GK: That you're very, very, very bad.
Listen, no athlete, no champion likes to lose. I get that. But they say when it comes to losing, you are very, very, very bad at it.
SW: I'm number one at losing too, so you know, that's all I can say.
(Laughter)
GK: I'm always curious about the dynamic between you and Venus, because everybody that knows you and has followed the story knows that you two are very close, and you always bring your A game in whatever you do, but I often wonder, when you're playing her, do you bring your A- game because you want to do something for her or do you bring your A++ game because you want to crush her.
Is it harder for you playing her or easier?
SW: Well, playing Venus is like playing myself, because we grew up playing each other, we grew up practicing together.
And it was something that has been difficult, because she's my toughest opponent.
She's tall, she's fast, she hits hard like me, she serves like me.
It's really like playing a wall.
GK: She knows you.
SW: She knows where I'm hitting the ball before I hit it, so it's something that is not very easy, but it's really about, when I go out there, I really have to shut down my mind and I have to say to myself, "You know what?
I'm just playing a great player, but today I have to be better.
I don't care who it is, if it's my sister or it's my friend, today is the day I have to show up and I have to be better and I have to want it more than anyone else at this moment anywhere on this world."
GK: So never on the court do you fall back for Venus? Because, you know, it was always Venus and Serena.
SW: Yes. GK: And now baby sister has surpassed older sister. Do you feel guilt about that? Do you feel joy in that?
Is that a difficult position for you?
SW: I don't feel anything in there.
In my life, it still and forever is always going to be Venus and Serena.
She's really love of my life, she's my best friend, she's my soul mate.
I mean -- There's pictures of her pushing me, really low-quality pictures or else I would have shared them, of her pushing me in a stroller on a tennis court, and she always took care of me.
I used to spend all of my allowance money on the ice cream truck and stuff, and she would take her money and give it to me at school and make sure I had something to eat and she would go without, and that's the kind of person she actually is since I've always known her.
So we always have this incredible respect for each other and this incredible love, and I think it's important for people to realize you can be successful but you can still have a wonderful relationship.
On the court we are mortal enemies, but the second we shake hands, we are best friends again.
And if I lose, it might be a day later for me, but for Venus --
(Laughter) GK: There's never a time on the court where you hit the ball and say, "That's for seventh grade when you did the blah blah blah"?
You never have any moment like that?
SW: I feel like she should have those moments, because she's never done anything bad to me, but I'm the youngest.
I'm the younger sister.
GK: Serena, she's never done anything bad to you? Really? I have three sisters.
I can think of some stuff I've done bad.
SW: Unless she brainwashed me to forget them.
GK: No, but the love you have for her I know is very pure. I know that.
SW: Yes. GK: I know that.
SW: We were always brought up to be superclose, and we are incredibly close. Not only her. I have three other sisters as well, and we were always so close.
GK: So before a big match, the two of you don't get together and say, look, we're going to go out there and -- there's nothing?
SW: Well, it's funny.
Before the Australian Open, we were in the locker room together, and I always pick on her, so I pulled out my camera while she was changing. I started taking pictures of her, which is totally inappropriate, but she was so mad at me.
She's like, "Serena, stop!" And I was just laughing at her.
But that's the kind of relationship that we have, and like I said, the second we step on the court, it was like, we were definitely mortal enemies, but the second we stepped off, and moments before, we're just -- It is what it is, because at the end of the day, she'll always be my sister.
I'm not going to play Australia in -- Well, who knows, I've been playing forever, but I don't think I'll be playing in 50 years, say?
Let's be safe and say 50 years.
GK: I don't know, Serena.
There's never been anybody like you. When you think about it, never been anybody who has intersected gender and race the way you have, the dominance that you have and the scrutiny that you have.
And when you were growing up, did you say, "I want to be like that"?
Because now little girls are looking at you saying, "I want to be like that." Who was the "I want to be like that" for you?
SW: Well, it's interesting, and I'm glad you brought that up.
For me, when I grew up, I always wanted to be the best, and I said, if you want to be the best, you've got to emulate the best.
So when I started to go on tour when I was really young, I would see Steffi Graf, I would see Monica Seles, and I would even see Pete Sampras, and I would see what they did, and I noticed that Steffi and Monica didn't really talk to a lot of the other players, and they kind of were on their own, and they were just so focused and I would see Pete Sampras, the technique that he did, and I was like, "I want to do that." So I did that, and I felt that to be the best, and if you want to be the best, you have to hang around people and you have to look at people that are the best, because you're not going to be the best if you're looking at someone that's not at the top level.
GK: People say nobody works as hard as you.
SW: I'm a very hard worker.
GK: That's what I heard.
SW: People say, "Oh, she's talented, she's athletic." Actually, I wasn't. I was really small for my age.
I grew up when I got older, and I had to work really hard, and I think one of the reasons why I fight so hard and I work so hard is because I was really, really, really small.
GK: Yeah. You are no longer small.
SW: No, I'm fully grown now.
But I was small when I was really young for whatever reason.
I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties.
GK: You know, the other thing people talk about is your body.
Your body brings men and women to their knees.
And I mean in a good way.
A lot has been made about your body.
It's a work of art, it's masculine, it's glorious, there's never been anything like it.
Did you have body issues when you were growing up?
Have you always been comfortable with your body?
SW: It's interesting, because when you're a teenage female growing up in the public eye, it is a lot of scrutiny that you face, and as any female that's a teenager, I definitely was not comfortable in my body.
I didn't like it.
I didn't understand why I had muscles.
And I stopped lifting weights.
I was like, I'm not going to do this.
But then after I won the US Open, I realized that my body helped me reach goals that I wanted to reach, and I wanted to be happy with it, and I was so appreciative of it.
I'm always healthy.
I'm really fortunate and superblessed, and I felt like not only am I happy with my body, but I want other people and other young girls that have experienced what I've experienced to be happy with themselves.
So whatever people say -- masculine, whatever, too much, too little -- I'm OK with it as long as I love myself.
(Applause)
GK: I know you learn a lot from winning, but what have you learned from losing?
SW: I hate to lose, but I think losing has brought me here today.
The only reason I am who I am is because of my losses, and some of them are extremely painful, but I wouldn't take any of them away, because every time I lose, it takes a really long time for me to lose again because I learn so much from it.
And I encourage everyone that I talk to -- I'm like, listen, if you lose or if something happens -- not in sports -- in business or in school -- learn from it.
Don't live in the past, live in the present, and don't make the same mistakes in the future.
That's something that I always try to live by.
GK: Now you're planning a wedding and I want to know, is it a destination wedding in the Catskills or Poconos or are you going to do it in Florida?
What are you thinking? Big or small?
SW: We're thinking medium size.
We don't want to do too big, but then we're like, OK, we can't say no to this person, this person.
So we're thinking medium size and we're just thinking — My personality is a lot of fun.
Hopefully you can see that today.
I'm not too serious.
GK: And you like to dance.
And the next chapter for Serena Williams is what? SW: Oh, next for me.
Obviously I'm going to have a baby and I'm going to stay fit and kind of come back and play tennis and keep working on my fashion line.
That'll be really fun.
GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl?
SW: I don't. I have a feeling of one or the other.
It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling.
GK: Gayle is a unisex name.
Whatever you and Alexis decide, we are cheering you on! SW: Thank you for that. GK: You're welcome.
We are cheering you on, Serena Williams.
SW: Thank you so much.
(Applause) Thank you guys.
How many people here would like to live to be at least 80 years old? Yeah. I think we all have this hopeful expectation of living into old age.
Let's project out into the future, to your future "you's," and let's imagine that we're all 85.
Now, everyone look at two people.
One of you probably has Alzheimer's disease.
(Laughter)
Alright, alright. And maybe you're thinking, "Well, it won't be me." Then, OK. You are a caregiver. So --
so in some way, this terrifying disease is likely to affect us all.
Part of the fear around Alzheimer's stems from the sense that there's nothing we can do about it.
Despite decades of research, we still have no disease-modifying treatment and no cure.
So if we're lucky enough to live long enough, Alzheimer's appears to be our brain's destiny.
But maybe it doesn't have to be.
What if I told you we could change these statistics, literally change our brain's destiny, without relying on a cure or advancements in medicine?
Let's begin by looking at what we currently understand about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.
Here's a picture of two neurons connecting.
The point of connection, this space circled in red, is called the synapse.
The synapse is where neurotransmitters are released.
This is where signals are transmitted, where communication happens.
This is where we think, feel, see, hear, desire ... and remember.
And the synapse is where Alzheimer's happens.
Let's zoom in on the synapse and look at a cartoon representation of what's going on.
During the business of communicating information, in addition to releasing neurotransmitters like glutamate into the synapse, neurons also release a small peptide called amyloid beta.
Normally, amyloid beta is cleared away metabolized by microglia, the janitor cells of our brains.
While the molecular causes of Alzheimer's are still debated, most neuroscientists believe that the disease begins when amyloid beta begins to accumulate.
Too much is released, or not enough is cleared away, and the synapse begins to pile up with amyloid beta.
And when this happens, it binds to itself, forming sticky aggregates called amyloid plaques.
How many people here are 40 years old or older?
You're afraid to admit it now.
This initial step into the disease, this presence of amyloid plaques accumulating, can already be found in your brains.
The only way we could be sure of this would be through a PET scan, because at this point, you are blissfully unaware.
You're not showing any impairments in memory, language, or cognition ... yet.
We think it takes at least 15 to 20 years of amyloid plaque accumulation before it reaches a tipping point, then triggering a molecular cascade that causes the clinical symptoms of the disease.
Prior to the tipping point, your lapses in memory might include things like, "Why did I come in this room?" or "Oh ... what's his name?" or "Where did I put my keys?"
Now, before you all start freaking out again, because I know half of you did at least one of those in the last 24 hours -- these are all normal kinds of forgetting.
In fact, I would argue that these examples might not even involve your memory, because you didn't pay attention to where you put your keys in the first place.
After the tipping point, the glitches in memory, language and cognition are different.
Instead of eventually finding your keys in your coat pocket or on the table by the door, you find them in the refrigerator, or you find them and you think, "What are these for?"
So what happens when amyloid plaques accumulate to this tipping point?
Our microglia janitor cells become hyper-activated, releasing chemicals that cause inflammation and cellular damage.
We think they might actually start clearing away the synapses themselves.
A crucial neural transport protein called "tau" becomes hyperphosphorylated and twists itself into something called "tangles," which choke off the neurons from the inside.
By mid-stage Alzheimer's, we have massive inflammation and tangles and all-out war at the synapse and cell death.
So if you were a scientist trying to cure this disease, at what point would you ideally want to intervene?
Many scientists are betting big on the simplest solution: keep amyloid plaques from reaching that tipping point, which means that drug discovery is largely focused on developing a compound that will prevent, eliminate, or reduce amyloid plaque accumulation.
So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be a preventative medicine.
We're going to have to take this pill before we reach that tipping point, before the cascade is triggered, before we start leaving our keys in the refrigerator.
We think this is why, to date, these kinds of drugs have failed in clinical trials -- not because the science wasn't sound, but because the people in these trials were already symptomatic.
It was too late.
Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match.
At the tipping point, the match sets fire to the forest.
Once the forest is ablaze, it doesn't do any good to blow out the match.
You have to blow out the match before the forest catches fire.
Even before scientists sort this out, this information is actually really good news for us, because it turns out that the way we live can influence the accumulation of amyloid plaques.
And so there are things we can do to keep us from reaching that tipping point.
Let's picture your risk of Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.
We're going to pile risk factors on one arm, and when that arm hits the floor, you are symptomatic and diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
Let's imagine you're 50 years old.
You're not a spring chicken anymore, so you've accumulated some amyloid plaques with age.
Your scale is tipped a little bit.
Now let's look at your DNA. We've all inherited our genes from our moms and our dads.
Some of these genes will increase our risk and some will decrease it.
If you're like Alice in "Still Alice," you've inherited a rare genetic mutation that cranks out amyloid beta, and this alone will tip your scale arm to the ground.
But for most of us, the genes we inherit will only tip the arm a bit.
For example, APOE4 is a gene variant that increases amyloid, but you can inherit a copy of APOE4 from mom and dad and still never get Alzheimer's, which means that for most of us, our DNA alone does not determine whether we get Alzheimer's. So what does? We can't do anything about getting older or the genes we've inherited.
So far, we haven't changed our brain's destiny.
What about sleep? In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells rinse cerebral spinal fluid throughout our brains, clearing away metabolic waste that accumulated in our synapses while we were awake.
Deep sleep is like a power cleanse for the brain.
But what happens if you short change yourself on sleep?
Many scientists believe that poor sleep hygiene might actually be a predictor of Alzheimer's.
A single night of sleep deprivation leads to an increase in amyloid beta.
And amyloid accumulation has been shown to disrupt sleep, which in turn causes more amyloid to accumulate.
And so now we have this positive feedback loop that's going to accelerate the tipping of that scale.
What else? Cardiovascular health. High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, have all been shown to increase our risk of developing Alzheimer's.
Some autopsy studies have shown that as many as 80 percent of people with Alzheimer's also had cardiovascular disease.
Aerobic exercise has been shown in many studies to decrease amyloid beta in animal models of the disease.
So a heart-healthy Mediterranean lifestyle and diet can help to counter the tipping of this scale.
So there are many things we can do to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's.
But let's say you haven't done any of them.
Let's say you're 65; there's Alzheimer's in your family, so you've likely inherited a gene or two that tips your scale arm a bit; you've been burning the candle at both ends for years; you love bacon; and you don't run unless someone's chasing you.
(Laughter)
Let's imagine that your amyloid plaques have reached that tipping point.
Your scale arm has crashed to the floor.
You've tripped the cascade, setting fire to the forest, causing inflammation, tangles, and cell death.
You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.
You should be having trouble finding words and keys and remembering what I said at the beginning of this talk. But you might not be.
There's one more thing you can do to protect yourself from experiencing the symptoms of Alzheimer's, even if you have the full-blown disease pathology ablaze in your brain.
It has to do with neural plasticity and cognitive reserve.
Remember, the experience of having Alzheimer's is ultimately a result of losing synapses.
The average brain has over a hundred trillion synapses, which is fantastic; we've got a lot to work with.
And this isn't a static number.
We gain and lose synapses all the time, through a process called neural plasticity.
Every time we learn something new, we are creating and strengthening new neural connections, new synapses.
In the Nun Study, 678 nuns, all over the age of 75 when the study began, were followed for more than two decades. They were regularly given physical checkups and cognitive tests, and when they died, their brains were all donated for autopsy.
In some of these brains, scientists discovered something surprising.
Despite the presence of plaques and tangles and brain shrinkage -- what appeared to be unquestionable Alzheimer's -- the nuns who had belonged to these brains showed no signs of having the disease while they were alive.
How can this be? We think it's because these nuns had a high level of cognitive reserve, which is a way of saying that they had more functional synapses.
People who have more years of formal education, who have a high degree of literacy, who engage regularly in mentally stimulating activities, all have more cognitive reserve.
They have an abundance and a redundancy in neural connections.
So even if they have a disease like Alzheimer's compromising some of their synapses, they've got many extra backup connections, and this buffers them from noticing that anything is amiss.
Let's imagine a simplified example. Let's say you only know one thing about a subject.
Let's say it's about me.
You know that Lisa Genova wrote "Still Alice," and that's the only thing you know about me.
You have that single neural connection, that one synapse.
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's.
You have plaques and tangles and inflammation and microglia devouring that synapse.
Now when someone asks you, "Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'" you can't remember, because that synapse is either failing or gone.
You've forgotten me forever.
But what if you had learned more about me?
Let's say you learned four things about me.
Now imagine you have Alzheimer's. and three of those synapses are damaged or destroyed.
You still have a way to detour the wreckage.
You can still remember my name.
So we can be resilient to the presence of Alzheimer's pathology through the recruitment of yet-undamaged pathways.
And we create these pathways, this cognitive reserve, by learning new things.
Ideally, we want these new things to be as rich in meaning as possible, recruiting sight and sound and associations and emotion.
So this really doesn't mean doing crossword puzzles.
You don't want to simply retrieve information you've already learned, because this is like traveling down old, familiar streets, cruising neighborhoods you already know.
You want to pave new neural roads.
Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain means learning to speak Italian, meeting new friends, reading a book, or listening to a great TED Talk.
And if, despite all of this, you are someday diagnosed with Alzheimer's, there are three lessons I've learned from my grandmother and the dozens of people I've come to know living with this disease.
Diagnosis doesn't mean you're dying tomorrow. Keep living. You won't lose your emotional memory.
You'll still be able to understand love and joy.
You might not remember what I said five minutes ago, but you'll remember how I made you feel.
And you are more than what you can remember.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Let's say you despise Western democracy.
Democracy, in all its trappings, free elections, town halls, endless debates about the proper role of government.
Too messy, too unpredictable, too constraining for your taste.
And the way these democracies band together and lecture everyone else about individual rights and freedoms -- it gets under your skin.
So what to do about it? You can call out the hypocrisy and failures of Western democracies and explain how your way is better, but that's never really worked for you.
What if you could get the people whose support is the very foundation of these democracies to start questioning the system?
Make the idea occur in their own minds that democracy and its institutions are failing them, their elite are corrupt puppet masters and the country they knew is in free fall.
To do that, you'll need to infiltrate the information spheres of these democracies.
You'll need to turn their most powerful asset -- an open mind -- into their greatest vulnerability.
You'll need people to question the truth.
Now, you'll be familiar of hacking and leaks that happened in 2016.
One was the Democratic National Committee's networks, and the personal email accounts of its staff, later released on WikiLeaks.
After that, various online personas, like a supposed Romanian cybercriminal who didn't speak Romanian, aggressively pushed news of these leaks to journalists.
The media took the bait.
They were consumed by how much the DNC hated Bernie.
At the time, it was that narrative that far outshined the news that a group of Russian government sponsored hackers who we called "Advanced Persistent Threat 28," or "APT28" for short, was carrying out these operations against the US.
And there was no shortage of evidence.
This group of Russian government hackers hadn't just appeared out of nowhere in 2016.
We had started tracking this group back in 2014.
And the tools that APT28 used to compromise its victims' networks demonstrated a thoughtful, well-resourced effort that had taken place for now over a decade in Moscow's time zone from about 9 am to 6 pm.
APT28 loved to prey on the emails and contacts of journalists in Chechnya, the Georgian government, eastern European defense attachés — all targets with an undeniable interest to the Russian government.
We weren't the only ones onto this.
Governments, research teams across the world, were coming to similar conclusions and observing the same types of operations.
But what Russia was doing in 2016 went far beyond espionage.
The DNC hack was just one of many where stolen data was posted online accompanied by a sensational narrative, then amplified in social media for lightning-speed adoption by the media.
This didn't ring the alarm bells that a nation-state was trying to interfere with the credibility of another's internal affairs.
So why, collectively, did we not see this coming?
Why did it take months before Americans understood that they were under a state-sponsored information attack?
The easy answer is politics.
The Obama Administration was caught in a perfect catch-22.
By raising the specter that the Russian government was interfering in the US presidential campaign, the Administration risked appearing to meddle in the campaign itself.
But the better answer, I think, is that the US and the West were utterly unequipped to recognize and respond to a modern information operation, despite the fact that the US had wielded information with devastating success in an era not so long ago.
Look, so while the US and the West spent the last 20 years caught up in cybersecurity -- what networks to harden, which infrastructure to deem critical, how to set up armies of cyber warriors and cyber commands -- Russia was thinking in far more consequential terms.
Before the first iPhone even hit the shelf, the Russian government understood the risks and the opportunity that technology provided and the inter-communication and instant communication it provided us.
As our realities are increasingly based on the information that we're consuming at the palm of our hand and from the news feeds that we're scanning and the hashtags and stories that we see trending, the Russian government was the first to recognize how this evolution had turned your mind into the most exploitable device on the planet.
And your mind is particularly exploitable if you're accustomed to an unfettered flow of information, now increasingly curated to your own tastes.
This panorama of information that's so interesting to you gives a state, or anyone for that matter, a perfect back door into your mind.
It's this new brand of state-spons ored information operations that can be that much more successful, more insidious, and harder for the target audience -- that includes the media -- to decipher and characterize.
If you can get a hashtag trending on Twitter, or chum the waters with fake news directed to audiences primed to receive it, or drive journalists to dissect terabytes of email for a cent of impropriety -- all tactics used in Russian operations -- then you've got a shot at effectively camouflaging your operations in the mind of your target.
This is what Russia's long called "reflexive control." It's the ability to use information on someone else so that they make a decision on their own accord that's favorable to you.
This is nation-state-grade image control and perception management, and it's conducted by any means, with any tools, network-based or otherwise, that will achieve it.
Take this for another example. In early February 2014, a few weeks before Russia would invade Crimea, a phone call is posted on YouTube. In it, there's two US diplomats.
They sound like they're playing kingmaker in Ukraine, and worse, they curse the EU for its lack of speed and leadership in resolving the crisis.
The media covers the phone call, and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash leaves Washington and Europe reeling.
And it creates a fissured response and a feckless attitude towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine. Mission accomplished.
So while hacked phone calls and emails and networks keep grabbing the headlines, the real operations are the ones that are influencing the decisions you make and the opinions you hold, all in the service of a nation-state's strategic interest.
This is power in the information age.
And this information is all that much more seductive, all that much easier to take at face value and pass on, when it's authentic.
Who's not interested in the truth that's presented in phone calls and emails that were never intended for public consumption?
But how meaningful is that truth if you don't know why it's being revealed to you?
We must recognize that this place where we're increasingly living, which we've quaintly termed "cyberspace," isn't defined by ones and zeroes, but by information and the people behind it.
This is far more than a network of computers and devices.
This is a network composed of minds interacting with computers and devices.
And for this network, there's no encryption, there's no firewall, no two-factor authentication, no password complex enough to protect you.
What you have for defense is far stronger, it's more adaptable, it's always running the latest version. It's the ability to think critically: call out falsehood, press for the facts.
And above all, you must have the courage to unflinchingly pursue the truth.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.
It's great to have you here.
Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.
CA: So, in the next half hour or so, we're going to spend some time exploring your vision for what an exciting future might look like, which I guess makes the first question a little ironic: Why are you boring?
EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently.
We're trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully be a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion.
So right now, one of the most soul-destroying things is traffic.
It affects people in every part of the world.
It takes away so much of your life. It's horrible. It's particularly horrible in LA.
(Laughter)
CA: I think you've brought with you the first visualization that's been shown of this. Can I show this?
EM: Yeah, absolutely.
So this is the first time — Just to show what we're talking about.
So a couple of key things that are important in having a 3D tunnel network.
First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city.
So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate, that's on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance and exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces.
And then the car gets on a skate.
There's no speed limit here, so we're designing this to be able to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.
CA: How much?
EM: 200 kilometers an hour, or about 130 miles per hour.
So you should be able to get from, say, Westwood to LAX in six minutes -- five, six minutes.
(Applause)
CA: So possibly, initially done, it's like on a sort of toll road-type basis.
EM: Yeah.
CA: Which, I guess, alleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well.
EM: So, I don't know if people noticed it in the video, but there's no real limit to how many levels of tunnel you can have.
You can go much further deep than you can go up.
The deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary level of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network.
This is a very important point.
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion, it will get used up, and then you'll be back where you started, back with congestion.
But you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels.
CA: But people -- seen traditionally, it's incredibly expensive to dig, and that would block this idea.
EM: Yeah. Well, they're right. To give you an example, the LA subway extension, which is — I think it's a two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed for two billion dollars.
So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the subway extension in LA.
And this is not the highest utility subway in the world.
So yeah, it's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally.
I think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling.
CA: And how could you achieve that?
EM: Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that.
So the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more.
So a single road lane tunnel according to regulations has to be 26 feet, maybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation for combustion engine cars.
But if you shrink that diameter to what we're attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty to get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area by a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales with the cross-sectional area.
So that's roughly a half-order of magnitude improvement right there.
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel for half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time is putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall.
So if you design the machine instead to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing, that will give you a factor of two improvement.
Combine that and that's a factor of eight.
Also these machines are far from being at their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power to the machine substantially.
I think you can get at least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five improvement on top of that.
So I think there's a fairly straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is -- we've got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail from "South Park," I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."
(Laughter)
So Gary is capable of -- currently he's capable of going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine.
(Laughter)
CA: You want to beat Gary.
EM: We want to beat Gary.
(Laughter)
He's not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory.
Victory is beating the snail.
CA: But a lot of people imagining, dreaming about future cities, they imagine that actually the solution is flying cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn't that a better solution?
You save all that tunneling cost.
EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.
Obviously, I do rockets, so I like things that fly.
This is not some inherent bias against flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they'll be quite noisy, the wind force generated will be very high.
Let's just say that if something's flying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.
You don't think to yourself, "Well, I feel better about today." You're thinking, "Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off and guillotine me?" Things like that.
CA: So you've got this vision of future cities with these rich, 3D networks of tunnels underneath.
Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?
Could you apply these tunnels to use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago.
EM: Yeah, so we've been sort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.
We built a Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovative ideas in transport.
And it actually ends up being the biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume.
So it was quite fun to do that, but it was kind of a hobby thing, and then we think we might -- so we've built a little pusher car to push the student pods, but we're going to try seeing how fast we can make the pusher go if it's not pushing something.
So we're cautiously optimistic we'll be able to be faster than the world's fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch.
CA: Whoa. Good brakes.
EM: Yeah, I mean, it's — yeah.
It's either going to smash into tiny pieces or go quite fast.
CA: But you can picture, then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel running quite long distances.
EM: Exactly. And looking at tunneling technology, it turns out that in order to make a tunnel, you have to -- In order to seal against the water table, you've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres.
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or near-vacuum.
So actually, it sort of turns out that automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table, it is automatically capable of holding vacuum.
CA: Huh.
EM: So, yeah.
CA: And so you could actually picture, what kind of length tunnel is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?
EM: I think there's no real length limit.
You could dig as much as you want.
I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you'd probably want to go underground the entire way because it's a high-density area.
You're going under a lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel.
Sometimes people think, well, it's going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house.
Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four tunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able to detect it being dug at all.
In fact, if you're able to detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of money for that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detect tunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrol that try and detect drug tunnels.
So the reality is that earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depth is below a certain level, it is undetectable.
Maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic instrument, you might be able to detect it.
CA: So you've started a new company to do this called The Boring Company. Very nice. Very funny.
EM: What's funny about that?
(Laughter)
CA: How much of your time is this?
EM: It's maybe ... two or three percent.
CA: You've bought a hobby.
This is what an Elon Musk hobby looks like.
(Laughter)
EM: I mean, it really is, like -- This is basically interns and people doing it part time.
We bought some second-hand machinery.
It's kind of puttering along, but it's making good progress, so --
CA: So an even bigger part of your time is being spent on electrifying cars and transport through Tesla.
Is one of the motivations for the tunneling project the realization that actually, in a world where cars are electric and where they're self-driving, there may end up being more cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now?
EM: Yeah, exactly.
A lot of people think that when you make cars autonomous, they'll be able to go faster and that will alleviate congestion.
And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy where it's much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a car will be better than that of a bus.
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.
So the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy, and actually traffic will get far worse.
CA: You started Tesla with the goal of persuading the world that electrification was the future of cars, and a few years ago, people were laughing at you.
Now, not so much.
EM: OK.
(Laughter)
I don't know. I don't know.
CA: But isn't it true that pretty much every auto manufacturer has announced serious electrification plans for the short- to medium-term future?
EM: Yeah. Yeah. I think almost every automaker has some electric vehicle program.
They vary in seriousness.
Some are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric, and some are just dabbling in it.
And some, amazingly, are still pursuing fuel cells, but I think that won't last much longer.
CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory and say, you know, "We did it." Let the world electrify, and you go on and focus on other stuff?
EM: Yeah. I intend to stay with Tesla as far into the future as I can imagine, and there are a lot of exciting things that we have coming.
Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.
We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.
CA: OK, we're going to come to this.
So Model 3, it's supposed to be coming in July-ish.
EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good for starting production in July.
CA: Wow. One of the things that people are so excited about is the fact that it's got autopilot.
And you put out this video a while back showing what that technology would look like.
EM: Yeah. There's obviously autopilot in Model S right now. What are we seeing here? Yeah.
EM: Yeah, so this is using only cameras and GPS.
So there's no LIDAR or radar being used here.
This is just using passive optical, which is essentially what a person uses.
The whole road system is meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras, and so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved.
If you don't solve vision, it's not solved.
So that's why our focus is so heavily on having a vision neural net that's very effective for road conditions.
CA: Right. Many other people are going the LIDAR route.
You want cameras plus radar is most of it.
EM: You can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras.
Like, you can probably do it ten times better than humans would, just cameras.
CA: So the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them.
They can't yet do what that showed.
When will they be able to?
EM: I think we're still on track for being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the end of the year, fully autonomous.
CA: OK, so by the end of the year, you're saying, someone's going to sit in a Tesla without touching the steering wheel, tap in "New York," off it goes.
EM: Yeah.
CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel -- by the end of 2017.
EM: Yeah. Essentially, November or December of this year, we should be able to go all the way from a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point during the entire journey.
(Applause)
CA: Amazing. But part of that is possible because you've already got a fleet of Teslas driving all these roads.
You're accumulating a huge amount of data of that national road system.
EM: Yes, but the thing that will be interesting is that I'm actually fairly confident it will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically.
So, it's fairly easy -- If you say I'm going to be really good at one specific route, that's one thing, but it should be able to go, really be very good, certainly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system in a given country.
So it's not sort of limited to LA to New York.
We could change it and make it Seattle-Florida, that day, in real time.
So you were going from LA to New York.
Now go from LA to Toronto.
CA: So leaving aside regulation for a second, in terms of the technology alone, the time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they've arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely?
EM: I think that's about two years.
So the real trick of it is not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time, because, like, if a car crashes one in a thousand times, then you're probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep.
You shouldn't be, certainly.
(Laughter)
It's never going to be perfect.
No system is going to be perfect, but if you say it's perhaps -- the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes, or a thousand lifetimes, then people are like, OK, wow, if I were to live a thousand lives, I would still most likely never experience a crash, then that's probably OK.
CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern of yours is that people may actually get seduced too early to think that this is safe, and that you'll have some horrible incident happen that puts things back.
EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances.
The thing to appreciate about vehicle safety is this is probabilistic.
I mean, there's some chance that any time a human driver gets in a car, that they will have an accident that is their fault.
It's never zero.
So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy need to be than a person before you can rely on it?
CA: But once you get literally safe hands-off driving, the power to disrupt the whole industry seems massive, because at that point you've spoken of people being able to buy a car, drops you off at work, and then you let it go and provide a sort of Uber-like service to other people, earn you money, maybe even cover the cost of your lease of that car, so you can kind of get a car for free.
Is that really likely?
EM: Yeah. Absolutely this is what will happen.
So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose to use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used only by friends and family, only by other drivers who are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimes but not other times.
That's 100 percent what will occur.
It's just a question of when.
CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi and I think you're planning to announce this in September, but I'm curious whether there's anything you could show us today?
EM: I will show you a teaser shot of the truck.
(Laughter)
It's alive.
CA: OK.
EM: That's definitely a case where we want to be cautious about the autonomy features. Yeah.
(Laughter)
CA: We can't see that much of it, but it doesn't look like just a little friendly neighborhood truck.
It looks kind of badass.
What sort of semi is this?
EM: So this is a heavy duty, long-range semitruck.
So it's the highest weight capability and with long range.
So essentially it's meant to alleviate the heavy-duty trucking loads.
And this is something which people do not today think is possible.
They think the truck doesn't have enough power or it doesn't have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi.
And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semi will tug the diesel semi uphill.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
CA: That's pretty cool.
And short term, these aren't driverless.
These are going to be trucks that truck drivers want to drive.
EM: Yes. So what will be really fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curve with an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kind of internal combustion engine car, you've got a torque RPM curve that looks like a hill.
So this will be a very spry truck.
You can drive this around like a sports car.
There's no gears. It's, like, single speed.
CA: There's a great movie to be made here somewhere.
I don't know what it is and I don't know that it ends well, but it's a great movie.
(Laughter)
EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.
When I was driving the test prototype for the first truck. It's really weird, because you're driving around and you're just so nimble, and you're in this giant truck.
CA: Wait, you've already driven a prototype?
EM: Yeah, I drove it around the parking lot, and I was like, this is crazy.
CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.
EM: It's just like, driving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers.
CA: This is cool.
OK, from a really badass picture to a kind of less badass picture.
This is just a cute house from "Desperate Housewives" or something.
What on earth is going on here? EM: Well, this illustrates the picture of the future that I think is how things will evolve.
You've got an electric car in the driveway.
If you look in between the electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwalls stacked up against the side of the house, and then that house roof is a solar roof.
So that's an actual solar glass roof.
CA: OK.
EM: That's a picture of a real -- well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.
That's a real fake house.
(Laughter)
CA: So these roof tiles, some of them have in them basically solar power, the ability to --
EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles where you can adjust the texture and the color to a very fine-grained level, and then there's sort of microlouvers in the glass, such that when you're looking at the roof from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell behind it or not.
So you have an even color from the ground level.
If you were to look at it from a helicopter, you would be actually able to look through and see that some of the glass tiles have a solar cell behind them and some do not.
CA: You put them in the ones that are likely to see a lot of sun, and that makes these roofs super affordable, right?
They're not that much more expensive than just tiling the roof.
EM: Yeah. We're very confident that the cost of the roof plus the cost of electricity -- A solar glass roof will be less than the cost of a normal roof plus the cost of electricity.
So in other words, this will be economically a no-brainer, we think it will look great, and it will last -- We thought about having the warranty be infinity, but then people thought, well, that might sound like were just talking rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass.
Well after the house has collapsed and there's nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there.
(Applause)
CA: I mean, this is cool.
So you're rolling this out in a couple week's time, I think, with four different roofing types.
EM: Yeah, we're starting off with two, two initially, and the second two will be introduced early next year.
CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?
How many houses do you believe could end up having this type of roofing?
EM: I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof.
The thing is to consider the time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years.
So on average, a roof is replaced every 20 to 25 years.
But you don't start replacing all roofs immediately.
But eventually, if you say were to fast-forward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roof that does not have solar.
CA: Is there a mental model thing that people don't get here that because of the shift in the cost, the economics of solar power, most houses actually have enough sunlight on their roof pretty much to power all of their needs.
If you could capture the power, it could pretty much power all their needs.
You could go off-grid, kind of.
EM: It depends on where you are and what the house size is relative to the roof area, but it's a fair statement to say that most houses in the US have enough roof area to power all the needs of the house.
CA: So the key to the economics of the cars, the Semi, of these houses is the falling price of lithium-ion batteries, which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.
In many ways, that's almost the core competency.
And you've decided that to really, like, own that competency, you just have to build the world's largest manufacturing plant to double the world's supply of lithium-ion batteries, with this guy. What is this?
EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory, progress so far on the Gigafactory.
Eventually, you can sort of roughly see that there's sort of a diamond shape overall, and when it's fully done, it'll look like a giant diamond, or that's the idea behind it, and it's aligned on true north.
It's a small detail.
CA: And capable of producing, eventually, like a hundred gigawatt hours of batteries a year.
EM: A hundred gigawatt hours. We think probably more, but yeah.
CA: And they're actually being produced right now.
EM: They're in production already.
CA: You guys put out this video.
I mean, is that speeded up?
EM: That's the slowed down version.
(Laughter)
CA: How fast does it actually go?
EM: Well, when it's running at full speed, you can't actually see the cells without a strobe light. It's just blur.
(Laughter)
CA: One of your core ideas, Elon, about what makes an exciting future is a future where we no longer feel guilty about energy.
Help us picture this.
How many Gigafactories, if you like, does it take to get us there?
EM: It's about a hundred, roughly. It's not 10, it's not a thousand. Most likely a hundred.
CA: See, I find this amazing.
You can picture what it would take to move the world off this vast fossil fuel thing. It's like you're building one, it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.
Like, it's kind of cool that you can picture that project.
And you're planning to do, at Tesla -- announce another two this year.
EM: I think we'll announce locations for somewhere between two and four Gigafactories later this year.
Yeah, probably four.
CA: Whoa.
(Applause) No more teasing from you for here?
Like -- where, continent? You can say no.
EM: We need to address a global market.
CA: OK.
(Laughter)
This is cool. I think we should talk for — Actually, global market.
I'm going to ask you one question about politics, only one.
I'm kind of sick of politics, but I do want to ask you this.
You're on a body now giving advice to a guy --
EM: Who?
CA: Who has said he doesn't really believe in climate change, and there's a lot of people out there who think you shouldn't be doing that. They'd like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them?
EM: Well, I think that first of all, I'm just on two advisory councils where the format consists of going around the room and asking people's opinion on things, and so there's like a meeting every month or two.
That's the sum total of my contribution.
But I think to the degree that there are people in the room who are arguing in favor of doing something about climate change, or social issues, I've used the meetings I've had thus far to argue in favor of immigration and in favor of climate change.
(Applause)
And if I hadn't done that, that wasn't on the agenda before.
So maybe nothing will happen, but at least the words were said.
CA: OK.
(Applause)
So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.
Last time you were here, you spoke about what seemed like a kind of incredibly ambitious dream to develop rockets that were actually reusable.
And you've only gone and done it.
EM: Finally. It took a long time.
CA: Talk us through this. What are we looking at here?
EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back from very high and fast in space.
So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity.
I think this might have been at sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage.
(Applause)
CA: So that was a sped-up --
EM: That was the slowed down version.
(Laughter)
CA: I thought that was the sped-up version.
But I mean, that's amazing, and several of these failed before you finally figured out how to do it, but now you've done this, what, five or six times?
EM: We're at eight or nine.
CA: And for the first time, you've actually reflown one of the rockets that landed.
EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight again and flew it again, so it's the first reflight of an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant.
So it's important to appreciate that reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete.
So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid and complete.
You do not send your aircraft to Boeing in-between flights.
CA: Right. So this is allowing you to dream of this really ambitious idea of sending many, many, many people to Mars in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.
EM: Yeah.
CA: And you've designed this outrageous rocket to do it.
Help us understand the scale of this thing.
EM: Well, visually you can see that's a person.
Yeah, and that's the vehicle.
(Laughter)
CA: So if that was a skyscraper, that's like, did I read that, a 40-story skyscraper?
EM: Probably a little more, yeah.
The thrust level of this is really -- This configuration is about four times the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.
CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest rocket humanity ever created before.
EM: Yeah. Yeah.
CA: As one does. EM: Yeah.
(Laughter)
In units of 747, a 747 is only about a quarter of a million pounds of thrust, so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there's 40 747s.
So this would be the thrust equivalent of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.
CA: And so even with a machine designed to escape Earth's gravity, I think you told me last time this thing could actually take a fully loaded 747, people, cargo, everything, into orbit.
EM: Exactly. This can take a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel, maximum passengers, maximum cargo on the 747 — this can take it as cargo.
CA: So based on this, you presented recently this Interplanetary Transport System which is visualized this way.
This is a scene you picture in, what, 30 years time? 20 years time? People walking into this rocket.
EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of an eight- to 10-year time frame.
Aspirationally, that's our target.
Our internal targets are more aggressive, but I think --
(Laughter)
CA: OK.
EM: While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison with other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat.
The future spaceships will be truly enormous.
CA: Why, Elon?
Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people on it in your lifetime, which I think is kind of what you've said you'd love to do?
EM: I think it's important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing.
I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live.
Like, why do you want to live?
What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future?
And if we're not out there, if the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it's incredibly depressing if that's not the future that we're going to have.
(Applause)
CA: People want to position this as an either or, that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now from climate to poverty to, you know, you pick your issue.
And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn't be thinking about this. You should be solving what's here and now.
And to be fair, you've done a fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy. But why not just do that?
EM: I think there's -- I look at the future from the standpoint of probabilities.
It's like a branching stream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing.
I may introduce something new to the probability stream.
Sustainable energy will happen no matter what.
If there was no Tesla, if Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity. It's tautological. If you don't have sustainable energy, it means you have unsustainable energy.
Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economics will drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably.
The fundamental value of a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur.
So when I think, like, what is the fundamental good of a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade, potentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur.
That's what I consider to be the fundamental aspirational good of Tesla.
Then there's becoming a multiplanet species and space-faring civilization. This is not inevitable.
It's very important to appreciate this is not inevitable.
The sustainable energy future I think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilization is definitely not inevitable.
If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were able to send somebody to the moon. 1969. Then we had the Space Shuttle.
The Space Shuttle could only take people to low Earth orbit.
Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United States could take no one to orbit.
So that's the trend.
The trend is like down to nothing.
People are mistaken when they think that technology just automatically improves.
It does not automatically improve.
It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade, actually.
You look at great civilizations like Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that.
And then the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts.
They forgot how to do it.
CA: Elon, it almost seems, listening to you and looking at the different things you've done, that you've got this unique double motivation on everything that I find so interesting. One is this desire to work for humanity's long-term good.
The other is the desire to do something exciting.
And often it feels like you feel like you need the one to drive the other.
With Tesla, you want to have sustainable energy, so you made these super sexy, exciting cars to do it.
Solar energy, we need to get there, so we need to make these beautiful roofs.
We haven't even spoken about your newest thing, which we don't have time to do, but you want to save humanity from bad AI, and so you're going to create this really cool brain-machine interface to give us all infinite memory and telepathy and so forth.
And on Mars, it feels like what you're saying is, yeah, we need to save humanity and have a backup plan, but also we need to inspire humanity, and this is a way to inspire.
EM: I think the value of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear.
I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.
That is not the -- I'm just trying to think about the future and not be sad.

CA: Beautiful statement. I think everyone here would agree that it is not — None of this is going to happen inevitably.
The fact that in your mind, you dream this stuff, you dream stuff that no one else would dare dream, or no one else would be capable of dreaming at the level of complexity that you do.
The fact that you do that, Elon Musk, is a really remarkable thing.
Thank you for helping us all to dream a bit bigger.
EM: But you'll tell me if it ever starts getting genuinely insane, right?
CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.
That was really, really fantastic.
That was really fantastic.
Getting a college education is a 20-year investment.
When you're growing up poor, you're not accustomed to thinking that far ahead.
Instead, you're thinking about where you're going to get your next meal and how your family is going to pay rent that month.
Besides, my parents and my friends' parents seemed to be doing just fine driving taxis and working as janitors.
It wasn't until I was a teenager when I realized I didn't want to do those things.
By then, I was two-thirds of the way through my education, and it was almost too late to turn things around.
When you grow up poor, you want to be rich.
I was no different.
I'm the second-oldest of seven, and was raised by a single mother on government aid in Queens, New York.
By virtue of growing up low-income, my siblings and I went to some of New York City's most struggling public schools.
I had over 60 absences when I was in seventh grade, because I didn't feel like going to class.
My high school had a 55 percent graduation rate, and even worse, only 20 percent of the kids graduating were college-ready.
When I actually did make it to college, I told my friend Brennan how our teachers would always ask us to raise our hands if we were going to college.
I was taken aback when Brennan said, "Karim, I've never been asked that question before." It was always, "What college are you going to?" Just the way that question is phrased made it unacceptable for him not to have gone to college.
Nowadays I get asked a different question. "How were you able to make it out?" For years I said I was lucky, but it's not just luck.
When my older brother and I graduated from high school at the very same time and he later dropped out of a two-year college, I wanted to understand why he dropped out and I kept studying.
It wasn't until I got to Cornell as a Presidential Research Scholar that I started to learn about the very real educational consequences of being raised by a single mother on government aid and attending the schools that I did.
That's when my older brother's trajectory began to make complete sense to me.
I also learned that our most admirable education reformers, people like Arne Duncan, the former US Secretary of Education, or Wendy Kopp, the founder of Teach For America, had never attended an inner city public school like I had.
So much of our education reform is driven by a sympathetic approach, where people are saying, "Let's go and help these poor inner city kids, or these poor black and Latino kids," instead of an empathetic approach, where someone like me, who had grown up in this environment, could say, "I know the adversities that you're facing and I want to help you overcome them."
Today when I get questions about how I made it out, I share that one of the biggest reasons is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.
In a typical middle class or affluent household, if a kid is struggling, there's a good chance that a parent or a teacher will come to their rescue even if they don't ask for help.
However, if that same kid is growing up poor and doesn't ask for help, there's a good chance that no one will help them.
There are virtually no social safety nets available.
So seven years ago, I started to reform our public education system shaped by my firsthand perspective.
And I started with summer school.
Research tells us that two-thirds of the achievement gap, which is the disparity in educational attainment between rich kids and poor kids or black kids and white kids, could be directly attributed to the summer learning loss.
In low-income neighborhoods, kids forget almost three months of what they learned during the school year over the summer.
They return to school in the fall, and their teachers spend another two months reteaching them old material.
That's five months.
The school year in the United States is only 10 months.
If kids lose five months of learning every single year, that's half of their education. Half.
If kids were in school over the summer, then they couldn't regress, but traditional summer school is poorly designed.
For kids it feels like punishment, and for teachers it feels like babysitting.
But how can we expect principals to execute an effective summer program when the school year ends the last week of June and then summer school starts just one week later?
There just isn't enough time to find the right people, sort out the logistics, and design an engaging curriculum that excites kids and teachers.
But what if we created a program over the summer that empowered teachers as teaching coaches to develop aspiring educators?
What if we empowered college-educated role models as teaching fellows to help kids realize their college ambitions?
What if empowered high-achieving kids as mentors to tutor their younger peers and inspire them to invest in their education?
What if we empowered all kids as scholars, asked them what colleges they were going to, designed a summer school they want to attend to completely eliminate the summer learning loss and close two-thirds of the achievement gap?
By this summer, my team will have served over 4,000 low-income children, trained over 300 aspiring teachers and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs across some of New York City's most disadvantaged neighborhoods.
(Applause)
And our kids are succeeding. Two years of independent evaluations tell us that our kids eliminate the summer learning loss and make growth of one month in math and two months in reading.
So instead of returning to school in the fall three months behind, they now go back four months ahead in math and five months ahead in reading.
(Applause)
Ten years ago, if you would have told me that I'd graduate in the top 10 percent of my class from an Ivy League institution and have an opportunity to make a dent on our public education system just by tackling two months of the calendar year, I would have said, "Nah.
No way. "What's even more exciting is that if we can prevent five months of lost time just by redesigning two months, imagine the possibilities that we can unlock by tackling the rest of the calendar year.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In 1956, a documentary by Jacques Cousteau won both the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.
This film was called, "Le Monde Du Silence," or, "The Silent World." The premise of the title was that the underwater world was a quiet world.
We now know, 60 years later, that the underwater world is anything but silent.
Although the sounds are inaudible above water depending on where you are and the time of year, the underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or rainforest.
Invertebrates like snapping shrimp, fish and marine mammals all use sound.
They use sound to study their habitat, to keep in communication with each other, to navigate, to detect predators and prey.
They also use sound by listening to know something about their environment.
Take, for an example, the Arctic.
It's considered a vast, inhospitable place, sometimes described as a desert, because it is so cold and so remote and ice-covered for much of the year.
And despite this, there is no place on Earth that I would rather be than the Arctic, especially as days lengthen and spring comes.
To me, the Arctic really embodies this disconnect between what we see on the surface and what's going on underwater.
You can look out across the ice -- all white and blue and cold -- and see nothing.
But if you could hear underwater, the sounds you would hear would at first amaze and then delight you.
And while your eyes are seeing nothing for kilometers but ice, your ears are telling you that out there are bowhead and beluga whales, walrus and bearded seals.
The ice, too, makes sounds.
It screeches and cracks and pops and groans, as it collides and rubs when temperature or currents or winds change.
And under 100 percent sea ice in the dead of winter, bowhead whales are singing.
And you would never expect that, because we humans, we tend to be very visual animals.
For most of us, but not all, our sense of sight is how we navigate our world.
For marine mammals that live underwater, where chemical cues and light transmit poorly, sound is the sense by which they see.
And sound transmits very well underwater, much better than it does in air, so signals can be heard over great distances.
In the Arctic, this is especially important, because not only do Arctic marine mammals have to hear each other, but they also have to listen for cues in the environment that might indicate heavy ice ahead or open water.
Remember, although they spend most of their lives underwater, they are mammals, and so they have to surface to breathe.
So they might listen for thin ice or no ice, or listen for echoes off nearby ice.
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape.
In the spring, it can be a cacophony of sound.
(Marine mammal sounds)
But when the ice is frozen solid, and there are no big temperature shifts or current changes, the underwater Arctic has some of the lowest ambient noise levels of the world's oceans.
But this is changing.
This is primarily due to a decrease in seasonal sea ice, which is a direct result of human greenhouse gas emissions.
We are, in effect, with climate change, conducting a completely uncontrolled experiment with our planet.
Over the past 30 years, areas of the Arctic have seen decreases in seasonal sea ice from anywhere from six weeks to four months.
This decrease in sea ice is sometimes referred to as an increase in the open water season.
That is the time of year when the Arctic is navigable to vessels.
And not only is the extent of ice changing, but the age and the width of ice is, too.
Now, you may well have heard that a decrease in seasonal sea ice is causing a loss of habitat for animals that rely on sea ice, such as ice seals, or walrus, or polar bears.
Decreasing sea ice is also causing increased erosion along coastal villages, and changing prey availability for marine birds and mammals.
Climate change and decreases in sea ice are also altering the underwater soundscape of the Arctic.
What do I mean by soundscape?
Those of us who eavesdrop on the oceans for a living use instruments called hydrophones, which are underwater microphones, and we record ambient noise -- the noise all around us.
And the soundscape describes the different contributors to this noise field.
What we are hearing on our hydrophones are the very real sounds of climate change.
We are hearing these changes from three fronts: from the air, from the water and from land.
First: air. Wind on water creates waves.
These waves make bubbles; the bubbles break, and when they do, they make noise.
And this noise is like a hiss or a static in the background.
In the Arctic, when it's ice-covered, most of the noise from wind doesn't make it into the water column, because the ice acts as a buffer between the atmosphere and the water.
This is one of the reasons that the Arctic can have very low ambient noise levels.
But with decreases in seasonal sea ice, not only is the Arctic now open to this wave noise, but the number of storms and the intensity of storms in the Arctic has been increasing.
All of this is raising noise levels in a previously quiet ocean.
Second: water. With less seasonal sea ice, subarctic species are moving north, and taking advantage of the new habitat that is created by more open water.
Now, Arctic whales, like this bowhead, they have no dorsal fin, because they have evolved to live and swim in ice-covered waters, and having something sticking off of your back is not very conducive to migrating through ice, and may, in fact, be excluding animals from the ice.
But now, everywhere we've listened, we're hearing the sounds of fin whales and humpback whales and killer whales, further and further north, and later and later in the season.
We are hearing, in essence, an invasion of the Arctic by subarctic species.
And we don't know what this means.
Will there be competition for food between Arctic and subarctic animals?
Might these subarctic species introduce diseases or parasites into the Arctic?
And what are the new sounds that they are producing doing to the soundscape underwater?
And third: land. And by land ... I mean people.
More open water means increased human use of the Arctic.
Just this past summer, a massive cruise ship made its way through the Northwest Passage -- the once-mythical route between Europe and the Pacific.
Decreases in sea ice have allowed humans to occupy the Arctic more often.
It has allowed increases in oil and gas exploration and extraction, the potential for commercial shipping, as well as increased tourism.
And we now know that ship noise increases levels of stress hormones in whales and can disrupt feeding behavior.
Air guns, which produce loud, low-frequency "whoomps" every 10 to 20 seconds, changed the swimming and vocal behavior of whales.
And all of these sound sources are decreasing the acoustic space over which Arctic marine mammals can communicate.
Now, Arctic marine mammals are used to very high levels of noise at certain times of the year.
But this is primarily from other animals or from sea ice, and these are the sounds with which they've evolved, and these are sounds that are vital to their very survival.
These new sounds are loud and they're alien.
They might impact the environment in ways that we think we understand, but also in ways that we don't.
Remember, sound is the most important sense for these animals.
And not only is the physical habitat of the Arctic changing rapidly, but the acoustic habitat is, too.
It's as if we've plucked these animals up from the quiet countryside and dropped them into a big city in the middle of rush hour.
And they can't escape it.
So what can we do now?
We can't decrease wind speeds or keep subarctic animals from migrating north, but we can work on local solutions to reducing human-caused underwater noise.
One of these solutions is to slow down ships that traverse the Arctic, because a slower ship is a quieter ship.
We can restrict access in seasons and regions that are important for mating or feeding or migrating.
We can get smarter about quieting ships and find better ways to explore the ocean bottom.
And the good news is, there are people working on this right now.
But ultimately, we humans have to do the hard work of reversing or at the very least decelerating human-caused atmospheric changes.
So, let's return to this idea of a silent world underwater.
It's entirely possible that many of the whales swimming in the Arctic today, especially long-lived species like the bowhead whale that the Inuits say can live two human lives -- it's possible that these whales were alive in 1956, when Jacques Cousteau made his film.
And in retrospect, considering all the noise we are creating in the oceans today, perhaps it really was "The Silent World."
Thank you.

A few days after my husband Paul was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, we were lying in our bed at home, and Paul said, "It's going to be OK." And I remember answering back, "Yes.
We just don't know what OK means yet."
Paul and I had met as first-year medical students at Yale.
He was smart and kind and super funny.
He used to keep a gorilla suit in the trunk of his car, and he'd say, "It's for emergencies only."
(Laughter) I fell in love with Paul as I watched the care he took with his patients.
He stayed late talking with them, seeking to understand the experience of illness and not just its technicalities.
He later told me he fell in love with me when he saw me cry over an EKG of a heart that had ceased beating.
We didn't know it yet, but even in the heady days of young love, we were learning how to approach suffering together.
We got married and became doctors.
I was working as an internist and Paul was finishing his training as a neurosurgeon when he started to lose weight.
He developed excruciating back pain and a cough that wouldn't go away.
And when he was admitted to the hospital, a CT scan revealed tumors in Paul's lungs and in his bones.
We had both cared for patients with devastating diagnoses; now it was our turn.
We lived with Paul's illness for 22 months.
He wrote a memoir about facing mortality.
I gave birth to our daughter Cady, and we loved her and each other.
We learned directly how to struggle through really tough medical decisions.
The day we took Paul into the hospital for the last time was the most difficult day of my life.
When he turned to me at the end and said, "I'm ready," I knew that wasn't just a brave decision.
It was the right one.
Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.
In that moment, the most important thing to Paul was to hold our baby daughter.
Nine hours later, Paul died.
I've always thought of myself as a caregiver -- most physicians do -- and taking care of Paul deepened what that meant.
Watching him reshape his identity during his illness, learning to witness and accept his pain, talking together through his choices -- those experiences taught me that resilience does not mean bouncing back to where you were before, or pretending that the hard stuff isn't hard.
It is so hard.
It's painful, messy stuff.
But it's the stuff.
And I learned that when we approach it together, we get to decide what success looks like.
One of the first things Paul said to me after his diagnosis was, "I want you to get remarried." And I was like, whoa, I guess we get to say anything out loud.
(Laughter)
It was so shocking and heartbreaking ... and generous, and really comforting because it was so starkly honest, and that honesty turned out to be exactly what we needed.
Early in Paul's illness, we agreed we would just keep saying things out loud.
Tasks like making a will, or completing our advance directives -- tasks that I had always avoided -- were not as daunting as they once seemed.
I realized that completing an advance directive is an act of love -- like a wedding vow.
A pact to take care of someone, codifying the promise that til death do us part, I will be there.
If needed, I will speak for you.
I will honor your wishes.
That paperwork became a tangible part of our love story.
As physicians, Paul and I were in a good position to understand and even accept his diagnosis.
We weren't angry about it, luckily, because we'd seen so many patients in devastating situations, and we knew that death is a part of life.
But it's one thing to know that; it was a very different experience to actually live with the sadness and uncertainty of a serious illness.
Huge strides are being made against lung cancer, but we knew that Paul likely had months to a few years left to live.
During that time, Paul wrote about his transition from doctor to patient.
He talked about feeling like he was suddenly at a crossroads, and how he would have thought he'd be able to see the path, that because he treated so many patients, maybe he could follow in their footsteps.
But he was totally disoriented.
Rather than a path, Paul wrote, "I saw instead only a harsh, vacant, gleaming white desert.
As if a sandstorm had erased all familiarity.
I had to face my mortality and try to understand what made my life worth living, and I needed my oncologist's help to do so."
The clinicians taking care of Paul gave me an even deeper appreciation for my colleagues in health care.
We have a tough job.
We're responsible for helping patients have clarity around their prognoses and their treatment options, and that's never easy, but it's especially tough when you're dealing with potentially terminal illnesses like cancer.
Some people don't want to know how long they have left, others do.
Either way, we never have those answers.
Sometimes we substitute hope by emphasizing the best-case scenario.
In a survey of physicians, 55 percent said they painted a rosier picture than their honest opinion when describing a patient's prognosis.
It's an instinct born out of kindness.
But researchers have found that when people better understand the possible outcomes of an illness, they have less anxiety, greater ability to plan and less trauma for their families.
Families can struggle with those conversations, but for us, we also found that information immensely helpful with big decisions.
Most notably, whether to have a baby.
Months to a few years meant Paul was not likely to see her grow up.
But he had a good chance of being there for her birth and for the beginning of her life.
I remember asking Paul if he thought having to say goodbye to a child would make dying even more painful.
And his answer astounded me.
He said, "Wouldn't it be great if it did?" And we did it.
Not in order to spite cancer, but because we were learning that living fully means accepting suffering.
Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo so he could continue working as a neurosurgeon, which initially we thought was totally impossible.
When the cancer advanced and Paul shifted from surgery to writing, his palliative care doctor prescribed a stimulant medication so he could be more focused.
They asked Paul about his priorities and his worries.
They asked him what trade-offs he was willing to make.
Those conversations are the best way to ensure that your health care matches your values.
Paul joked that it's not like that "birds and bees" talk you have with your parents, where you all get it over with as quickly as possible, and then pretend it never happened.
You revisit the conversation as things change.
You keep saying things out loud.
I'm forever grateful because Paul's clinicians felt that their job wasn't to try to give us answers they didn't have, or only to try to fix things for us, but to counsel Paul through painful choices ... when his body was failing but his will to live wasn't.
Later, after Paul died, I received a dozen bouquets of flowers, but I sent just one... to Paul's oncologist, because she supported his goals and she helped him weigh his choices.
She knew that living means more than just staying alive.
A few weeks ago, a patient came into my clinic.
A woman dealing with a serious chronic disease.
And while we were talking about her life and her health care, she said, "I love my palliative care team.
They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'." Yeah, I thought, of course it is.
But many patients don't feel that.
Compassion and Choices did a study where they asked people about their health care preferences.
And a lot of people started their answers with the words "Well, if I had a choice ..." If I had a choice.
And when I read that "if," I understood better why one in four people receives excessive or unwanted medical treatment, or watches a family member receive excessive or unwanted medical treatment.
It's not because doctors don't get it. We do. We understand the real psychological consequences on patients and their families.
The things is, we deal with them, too.
Half of critical care nurses and a quarter of ICU doctors have considered quitting their jobs because of distress over feeling that for some of their patients, they've provided care that didn't fit with the person's values.
But doctors can't make sure your wishes are respected until they know what they are.
Would you want to be on life support if it offered any chance of longer life?
Are you most worried about the quality of that time, rather than quantity?
Both of those choices are thoughtful and brave, but for all of us, it's our choice.
That's true at the end of life and for medical care throughout our lives.
If you're pregnant, do you want genetic screening?
Is a knee replacement right or not?
Do you want to do dialysis in a clinic or at home?
The answer is: it depends.
What medical care will help you live the way you want to?
I hope you remember that question the next time you face a decision in your health care.
Remember that you always have a choice, and it is OK to say no to a treatment that's not right for you.
There's a poem by W.S. Merwin -- it's just two sentences long -- that captures how I feel now. "Your absence has gone through me like thread through a needle.
Everything I do is stitched with its color." For me that poem evokes my love for Paul, and a new fortitude that came from loving and losing him.
When Paul said, "It's going to be OK," that didn't mean that we could cure his illness.
Instead, we learned to accept both joy and sadness at the same time; to uncover beauty and purpose both despite and because we are all born and we all die.
And for all the sadness and sleepless nights, it turns out there is joy.
I leave flowers on Paul's grave and watch our two-year-old run around on the grass.
I build bonfires on the beach and watch the sunset with our friends.
Exercise and mindfulness meditation have helped a lot.
And someday, I hope I do get remarried.
Most importantly, I get to watch our daughter grow.
I've thought a lot about what I'm going to say to her when she's older. "Cady, engaging in the full range of experience -- living and dying, love and loss -- is what we get to do.
Being human doesn't happen despite suffering.
It happens within it.
When we approach suffering together, when we choose not to hide from it, our lives don't diminish, they expand."
I've learned that cancer isn't always a battle.
Or if it is, maybe it's a fight for something different than we thought.
Our job isn't to fight fate, but to help each other through.
Not as soldiers but as shepherds.
That's how we make it OK, even when it's not.
By saying it out loud, by helping each other through ... and a gorilla suit never hurts, either.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So Robert spent the last few years think about how weird human behavior is, and how inadequate most of our language trying to explain it is.
And it's very exciting to hear him explain some of the thinking behind it in public for the first time.
Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky.
(Applause)
Robert Sapolsky: Thank you. The fantasy always runs something like this. I've overpowered his elite guard, burst into his secret bunker with my machine gun ready.
He lunges for his Luger.
I knock it out of his hand.
He lunges for his cyanide pill.
I knock that out of his hand.
He snarls, comes at me with otherworldly strength.
We grapple, we fight, I manage to pin him down and put on handcuffs. "Adolf Hitler," I say, "I arrest you for crimes against humanity."
Here's where the Medal of Honor version of the fantasy ends and the imagery darkens.
What would I do if I had Hitler?
It's not hard to imagine once I allow myself.
Sever his spine at the neck.
Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument. Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.
Leave him alive on a respirator, tube-fed, not able to speak or move or see or hear, just to feel, and then inject him with something cancerous that's going to fester and pustulate until every cell in his body is screaming in agony, until every second feels like an eternity in hell.
That's what I would do to Hitler.
I've had this fantasy since I was a kid, still do sometimes, and when I do, my heart speeds up -- all these plans for the most evil, wicked soul in history.
But there's a problem, which is I don't actually believe in souls or evil, and I think wicked belongs in a musical.
But there's some people I would like to see killed, but I'm against the death penalty.
But I like schlocky violent movies, but I'm for strict gun control.
But then there was a time I was at a laser tag place, and I had such a good time hiding in a corner shooting at people.
In other words, I'm your basic confused human when it comes to violence.
Now, as a species, we obviously have problems with violence.
We use shower heads to deliver poison gas, letters with anthrax, airplanes as weapons, mass rape as a military strategy.
We're a miserably violent species.
But there's a complication, which is we don't hate violence, we hate the wrong kind.
And when it's the right kind, we cheer it on, we hand out medals, we vote for, we mate with our champions of it.
When it's the right kind of violence, we love it.
And there's another complication, which is, in addition to us being this miserably violent species, we're also this extraordinarily altruistic, compassionate one.
So how do you make sense of the biology of our best behaviors, our worst ones and all of those ambiguously in between?
Now, for starters, what's totally boring is understanding the motoric aspects of the behavior.
Your brain tells your spine, tells your muscles to do something or other, and hooray, you've behaved.
What's hard is understanding the meaning of the behavior, because in some settings, pulling a trigger is an appalling act; in others, it's heroically self-sacrificial.
In some settings, putting your hand one someone else's is deeply compassionate.
In others, it's a deep betrayal.
The challenge is to understand the biology of the context of our behaviors, and that's real tough.
One thing that's clear, though, is you're not going to get anywhere if you think there's going to be the brain region or the hormone or the gene or the childhood experience or the evolutionary mechanism that explains everything.
Instead, every bit of behavior has multiple levels of causality.
Let's look at an example. You have a gun.
There's a crisis going on: rioting, violence, people running around.
A stranger is running at you in an agitated state -- you can't quite tell if the expression is frightened, threatening, angry -- holding something that kind of looks like a handgun.
You're not sure.
The stranger comes running at you and you pull the trigger.
And it turns out that thing in this person's hand was a cell phone.
So we asked this biological question: what was going on that caused this behavior?
What caused this behavior?
And this is a multitude of questions.
We start. What was going on in your brain one second before you pulled that trigger?
And this brings us into the realm of a brain region called the amygdala.
The amygdala, which is central to violence, central to fear, initiates volleys of cascades that produce pulling of a trigger.
What was the level of activity in your amygdala one second before?
But to understand that, we have to step back a little bit.
What was going on in the environment seconds to minutes before that impacted the amygdala?
Now, obviously, the sights, the sounds of the rioting, that was pertinent.
But in addition, you're more likely to mistake a cell phone for a handgun if that stranger was male and large and of a different race.
Furthermore, if you're in pain, if you're hungry, if you're exhausted, your frontal cortex is not going to work as well, part of the brain whose job it is to get to the amygdala in time saying, "Are you really sure that's a gun there?"
But we need to step further back.
Now we have to look at hours to days before, and with this, we have entered the realm of hormones.
For example, testosterone, where regardless of your sex, if you have elevated testosterone levels in your blood, you're more likely to think a face with a neutral expression is instead looking threatening.
Elevated testosterone levels, elevated levels of stress hormones, and your amygdala is going to be more active and your frontal cortex will be more sluggish.
Pushing back further, weeks to months before, where's the relevance there?
This is the realm of neural plasticity, the fact that your brain can change in response to experience, and if your previous months have been filled with stress and trauma, your amygdala will have enlarged.
The neurons will have become more excitable, your frontal cortex would have atrophied, all relevant to what happens in that one second.
But we push back even more, back years, back, for example, to your adolescence.
Now, the central fact of the adolescent brain is all of it is going full blast except the frontal cortex, which is still half-baked.
It doesn't fully mature until you're around 25.
And thus, adolescence and early adulthood are the years where environment and experience sculpt your frontal cortex into the version you're going to have as an adult in that critical moment.
But pushing back even further, even further back to childhood and fetal life and all the different versions that that could come in.
Now, obviously, that's the time that your brain is being constructed, and that's important, but in addition, experience during those times produce what are called epigenetic changes, permanent, in some cases, permanently activating certain genes, turning off others.
And as an example of this, if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot of stress hormones through your mother, epigenetics is going to produce your amygdala in adulthood as a more excitable form, and you're going to have elevated stress hormone levels.
But pushing even further back, back to when you were just a fetus, back to when all you were was a collection of genes.
Now, genes are really important to all of this, but critically, genes don't determine anything, because genes work differently in different environments.
Key example here: there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A, and if you have that variant, you are far more likely to commit antisocial violence if, and only if, you were abused as a child.
Genes and environment interact, and what's happening in that one second before you pull that trigger reflects your lifetime of those gene-environment interactions.
Now, remarkably enough, we've got to push even further back now, back centuries.
What were your ancestors up to.
And if, for example, they were nomadic pastoralists, they were pastoralists, people living in deserts or grasslands with their herds of camels, cows, goats, odds are they would have invented what's called a culture of honor filled with warrior classes, retributive violence, clan vendettas, and amazingly, centuries later, that would still be influencing the values with which you were raised.
But we've got to push even further back, back millions of years, because if we're talking about genes, implicitly we're now talking about the evolution of genes.
And what you see is, for example, patterns across different primate species.
Some of them have evolved for extremely low levels of aggression, others have evolved in the opposite direction, and floating there in between by every measure are humans, once again this confused, barely defined species that has all these potentials to go one way or the other.
So what has this gotten us to?
Basically, what we're seeing here is, if you want to understand a behavior, whether it's an appalling one, a wondrous one, or confusedly in between, if you want to understand that, you've got take into account what happened a second before to a million years before, everything in between.
So what can we conclude at this point?
Officially, it's complicated.
Wow, that's really helpful. It's complicated, and you'd better be real careful, real cautious before you conclude you know what causes a behavior, especially if it's a behavior you're judging harshly.
Now, to me, the single most important point about all of this is one having to do with change.
Every bit of biology I have mentioned here can change in different circumstances.
For example, ecosystems change.
Thousands of years ago, the Sahara was a lush grassland. Cultures change. In the 17th century, the most terrifying people in Europe were the Swedes, rampaging all over the place.
This is what the Swedish military does now.
They haven't had a war in 200 years.
Most importantly, brains change.
Neurons grow new processes. Circuits disconnect. Everything in the brain changes, and out of this come extraordinary examples of human change.
First one: this is a man named John Newton, a British theologian who played a central role in the abolition of slavery from the British Empire in the early 1800s.
And amazingly, this man spent decades as a younger man as the captain of a slave ship, and then as an investor in slavery, growing rich from this.
And then something changed.
Something changed in him, something that Newton himself celebrated in the thing that he's most famous for, a hymn that he wrote: "Amazing Grace."
This is a man named Zenji Abe on the morning of December 6, 1941, about to lead a squadron of Japanese bombers to attack Pearl Harbor.
And this is the same man 50 years later to the day hugging a man who survived the attack on the ground.
And as an old man, Zenji Abe came to a collection of Pearl Harbor survivors at a ceremony there and in halting English apologized for what he had done as a young man.
Now, it doesn't always require decades.
Sometimes, extraordinary change could happen in just hours.
Consider the World War I Christmas truce of 1914.
The powers that be had negotiated a brief truce so that soldiers could go out, collect bodies from no-man's-land in between the trench lines.
And soon British and German soldiers were doing that, and then helping each other carry bodies, and then helping each other dig graves in the frozen ground, and then praying together, and then having Christmas together and exchanging gifts, and by the next day, they were playing soccer together and exchanging addresses so they could meet after the war.
That truce kept going until the officers had to arrive and said, "We will shoot you unless you go back to trying to kill each other." And all it took here was hours for these men to develop a completely new category of "us," all of us in the trenches here on both sides, dying for no damn reason, and who is a "them," those faceless powers behind the lines who were using them as pawns.
And sometimes, change can occur in seconds.
Probably the most horrifying event in the Vietnam War was the My Lai Massacre.
A brigade of American soldiers went into an undefended village full of civilians and killed between 350 and 500 of them, mass-raped women and children, mutilated bodies. It was appalling. It was appalling because it occurred, because the government denied it, because the US government eventually did nothing more than a slap on the wrist, and appalling because it almost certainly was not a singular event.
This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man who stopped the My Lai Massacre.
He was piloting a helicopter gunship, landed there, got out and saw American soldiers shooting babies, shooting old women, figured out what was going on, and he then took his helicopter and did something that undid his lifetime of conditioning as to who is an "us" and who is a "them." He landed his helicopter in between some surviving villagers and American soldiers and he trained his machine guns on his fellow Americans, and said, "If you don't stop the killing, I will mow you down."
Now, these people are no more special than any of us.
Same neurons, same neurochemicals, same biology.
What we're left with here is this inevitable cliche: "Those who don't study history are destined to repeat it." What we have here is the opposite of it.
Those who don't study the history of extraordinary human change, those who don't study the biology of what can transform us from our worst to our best behaviors, those who don't do this are destined not to be able to repeat these incandescent, magnificent moments.
So thank you.
(Applause)
CA: Talks that really give you a new mental model about something, those are some of my favorite TED Talks, and we just got one. Robert, thank you so much for that.
Good luck with the book. That was amazing, and we're going to try and get you to come here in person one year. Thank you so much.
RS: Thank you. Thank you all.
Namaskar.
I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age, and I don't use Botox as yet.
(Laughter)
So I'm clean, but I do behave like you saw like a 21-year-old in my movies.
Yeah, I do that.
I sell dreams and I peddle love to millions of people back home in India who assume that I'm the best lover in the world.
If you don't tell anyone, I'm going to tell you I'm not, but I never let that assumption go away.
(Laughter)
I've also been made to understand there are lots of you here who haven't seen my work, and I feel really sad for you.
(Laughter)
(Applause) That doesn't take away from the fact that I'm completely self-obsessed, as a movie star should be.
(Laughter)
That's when my friends, Chris and Juliet called me here to speak about the future "you." Naturally, it follows I'm going to speak about the present me.
(Laughter)
Because I truly believe that humanity is a lot like me.
(Laughter)
It is. It is. It's an aging movie star, grappling with all the newness around itself, wondering whether it got it right in the first place, and still trying to find a way to keep on shining regardless.
I was born in a refugee colony in the capital city of India, New Delhi.
And my father was a freedom fighter.
My mother was, well, just a fighter like mothers are.
And much like the original homo sapiens, we struggled to survive.
When I was in my early 20s, I lost both my parents, which I must admit seems a bit careless of me now, but —
(Laughter)
I do remember the night my father died, and I remember the driver of a neighbor who was driving us to the hospital.
He mumbled something about "dead people don't tip so well" and walked away into the dark.
And I was only 14 then, and I put my father's dead body in the back seat of the car, and my mother besides me, I started driving back from the hospital to the house.
And in the middle of her quiet crying, my mother looked at me and she said, "Son, when did you learn to drive?" And I thought about it and realized, and I said to my mom, "Just now, Mom."
(Laughter)
So from that night onwards, much akin to humanity in its adolescence, I learned the crude tools of survival.
And the framework of life was very, very simple then, to be honest.
You know, you just ate what you got and did whatever you were told to do.
I thought celiac was a vegetable, and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock's lost comrade in "Star Trek."
(Laughter)
You married the first girl that you dated, and you were a techie if you could fix the carburetor in your car.
I really thought that gay was a sophisticated English word for happy.
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital of Portugal, as you all know.
(Laughter)
Where was I? We relied on systems created through the toil and sacrifice of generations before to protect us, and we felt that governments actually worked for our betterment.
Science was simple and logical, Apple was still then just a fruit owned by Eve first and then Newton, not by Steve Jobs, until then. And "Eureka!" was what you screamed when you wanted to run naked on the streets.
You went wherever life took you for work, and people were mostly welcoming of you.
Migration was a term then still reserved for Siberian cranes, not human beings.
Most importantly, you were who you were and you said what you thought.
Then in my late 20s, I shifted to the sprawling metropolis of Mumbai, and my framework, like the newly industrialized aspirational humanity, began to alter.
In the urban rush for a new, more embellished survival, things started to look a little different.
I met people who had descended from all over the world, faces, races, genders, money-lenders.
Definitions became more and more fluid.
Work began to define you at that time in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner, and all the systems started to feel less reliable to me, almost too thick to hold on to the diversity of mankind and the human need to progress and grow.
Ideas were flowing with more freedom and speed.
And I experienced the miracle of human innovation and cooperation, and my own creativity, when supported by the resourcefulness of this collective endeavor, catapulted me into superstardom.
I started to feel that I had arrived, and generally, by the time I was 40, I was really, really flying. I was all over the place. You know? I'd done 50 films by then and 200 songs, and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.
I had been given the highest civil honor by the French government, the title of which for the life of me I can't pronounce even until now.
(Laughter)
I'm sorry, France, and thank you, France, for doing that.
But much bigger than that, I got to meet Angelina Jolie --
(Laughter)
for two and a half seconds.
(Laughter)
And I'm sure she also remembers that encounter somewhere.
OK, maybe not.
And I sat next to Hannah Montana on a round dinner table with her back towards me most of the time.
Like I said, I was flying, from Miley to Jolie, and humanity was soaring with me.
We were both pretty much flying off the handle, actually.
And then you all know what happened. The internet happened. I was in my late 40s, and I started tweeting like a canary in a birdcage and assuming that, you know, people who peered into my world would admire it for the miracle I believed it to be.
But something else awaited me and humanity.
You know, we had expected an expansion of ideas and dreams with the enhanced connectivity of the world.
We had not bargained for the village-like enclosure of thought, of judgment, of definition that flowed from the same place that freedom and revolution was taking place in.
Everything I said took a new meaning.
Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly -- was there for the world to comment upon and judge.
As a matter of fact, everything I didn't say or do also met with the same fate.
Four years ago, my lovely wife Gauri and me decided to have a third child.
It was claimed on the net that he was the love child of our first child who was 15 years old.
Apparently, he had sown his wild oats with a girl while driving her car in Romania.
And yeah, there was a fake video to go with it.
And we were so disturbed as a family.
My son, who is 19 now, even now when you say "hello" to him, he just turns around and says, "But bro, I didn't even have a European driving license."
(Laughter)
Yeah. In this new world, slowly, reality became virtual and virtual became real, and I started to feel that I could not be who I wanted to be or say what I actually thought, and humanity at this time completely identified with me.
I think both of us were going through our midlife crisis, and humanity, like me, was becoming an overexposed prima donna.
I started to sell everything, from hair oil to diesel generators.
Humanity was buying everything from crude oil to nuclear reactors.
You know, I even tried to get into a skintight superhero suit to reinvent myself.
I must admit I failed miserably.
And just an aside I want to say on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men and Supermen of the world, you have to commend them, because it really hurts in the crotch, that superhero suit.
(Laughter)
Yeah, I'm being honest.
I need to tell you this here. Really. And accidentally, I happened to even invent a new dance form which I didn't realize, and it became a rage.
So if it's all right, and you've seen a bit of me, so I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.
It was called the Lungi dance.
So if it's all right, I'll just show you.
I'm talented otherwise.
(Cheers)
So it went something like this.
Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi dance. Lungi.
That's it. It became a rage.
(Cheers)
It really did. Like you notice, nobody could make any sense of what was happening except me, and I didn't give a damn, really, because the whole world, and whole humanity, seemed as confused and lost as I was.
I didn't give up then.
I even tried to reconstruct my identity on the social media like everyone else does.
I thought if I put on philosophical tweets out there people will think I'm with it, but some of the responses I got from those tweets were extremely confusing acronyms which I didn't understand. You know? ROFL, LOL. "Adidas," somebody wrote back to one of my more thought-provoking tweets and I was wondering why would you name a sneaker, I mean, why would you write back the name of a sneaker to me?
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter, and she enlightened me. "Adidas" now means "All day I dream about sex."
(Laughter)
Really. I didn't know if you know that.
So I wrote back, "WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas, thanking secretly that some acronyms and things won't change at all. WTF.
But here we are. I am 51 years old, like I told you, and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding, I just want to tell you if there has been a momentous time for humanity to exist, it is now, because the present you is brave. The present you is hopeful. The present you is innovative and resourceful, and of course, the present you is annoyingly indefinable.
And in this spell-binding, imperfect moment of existence, feeling a little brave just before I came here, I decided to take a good, hard look at my face.
And I realized that I'm beginning to look more and more like the wax statue of me at Madame Tussaud's.
(Laughter)
Yeah, and in that moment of realization, I asked the most central and pertinent question to humanity and me: Do I need to fix my face? Really. I'm an actor, like I told you, a modern expression of human creativity.
The land I come from is the source of inexplicable but very simple spirituality.
Yeah. In its immense generosity, India decided somehow that I, the Muslim son of a broke freedom fighter who accidentally ventured into the business of selling dreams, should become its king of romance, the "Badhshah of Bollywood," the greatest lover the country has ever seen ... with this face.
(Laughter)
Which has alternately been described as ugly, unconventional, and strangely, not chocolatey enough.
(Laughter)
The people of this ancient land embraced me in their limitless love, and I've learned from these people that neither power nor poverty can make your life more magical or less tortuous.
I've learned from the people of my country that the dignity of a life, a human being, a culture, a religion, a country actually resides in its ability for grace and compassion.
I've learned that whatever moves you, whatever urges you to create, to build, whatever keeps you from failing, whatever helps you survive, is perhaps the oldest and the simplest emotion known to mankind, and that is love.
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,
(Recites poem in Hindi) (Poem ends)
Which loosely translates into that whatever -- yeah, if you know Hindi, please clap, yeah.
(Applause)
It's very difficult to remember.
Which loosely translates into actually saying that all the books of knowledge that you might read and then go ahead and impart your knowledge through innovation, through creativity, through technology, but mankind will never be the wiser about its future unless it is coupled with a sense of love and compassion for their fellow beings.
The two and a half alphabets which form the word "प्रेम," which means "love," if you are able to understand that and practice it, that itself is enough to enlighten mankind.
So I truly believe the future "you" has to be a you that loves.
Otherwise it will cease to flourish.
It will perish in its own self-absorption.
So you may use your power to build walls and keep people outside, or you may use it to break barriers and welcome them in.
You may use your faith to make people afraid and terrify them into submission, or you can use it to give courage to people so they rise to the greatest heights of enlightenment.
You can use your energy to build nuclear bombs and spread the darkness of destruction, or you can use it to spread the joy of light to millions.
You may filthy up the oceans callously and cut down all the forests.
You can destroy the ecology, or turn to them with love and regenerate life from the waters and trees.
You may land on Mars and build armed citadels, or you may look for life-forms and species to learn from and respect.
And you can use all the moneys we all have earned to wage futile wars and give guns in the hands of little children to kill each other with, or you can use it to make more food to fill their stomachs with.
My country has taught me the capacity for a human being to love is akin to godliness.
It shines forth in a world which civilization, I think, already has tampered too much with.
In the last few days, the talks here, the wonderful people coming and showing their talent, talking about individual achievements, the innovation, the technology, the sciences, the knowledge we are gaining by being here in the presence of TED Talks and all of you are reasons enough for us to celebrate the future "us." But within that celebration the quest to cultivate our capacity for love and compassion has to assert itself, has to assert itself, just as equally.
So I believe the future "you" is an infinite you.
It's called a chakra in India, like a circle.
It ends where it begins from to complete itself.
A you that perceives time and space differently understands both your unimaginable and fantastic importance and your complete unimportance in the larger context of the universe.
A you that returns back to the original innocence of humanity, which loves from the purity of heart, which sees from the eyes of truth, which dreams from the clarity of an untampered mind.
The future "you" has to be like an aging movie star who has been made to believe that there is a possibility of a world which is completely, wholly, self-obsessively in love with itself.
A world -- really, it has to be a you to create a world which is its own best lover.
That I believe, ladies and gentlemen, should be the future "you."
Thank you very much. Shukriya.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Thank you.
This is Lee Sedol. Lee Sedol is one of the world's greatest Go players, and he's having what my friends in Silicon Valley call a "Holy Cow" moment --
(Laughter)
a moment where we realize that AI is actually progressing a lot faster than we expected.
So humans have lost on the Go board.
What about the real world?
Well, the real world is much bigger, much more complicated than the Go board.
It's a lot less visible, but it's still a decision problem.
And if we think about some of the technologies that are coming down the pike ... Noriko [Arai] mentioned that reading is not yet happening in machines, at least with understanding.
But that will happen, and when that happens, very soon afterwards, machines will have read everything that the human race has ever written.
And that will enable machines, along with the ability to look further ahead than humans can, as we've already seen in Go, if they also have access to more information, they'll be able to make better decisions in the real world than we can.
So is that a good thing?
Well, I hope so.
Our entire civilization, everything that we value, is based on our intelligence.
And if we had access to a lot more intelligence, then there's really no limit to what the human race can do.
And I think this could be, as some people have described it, the biggest event in human history.
So why are people saying things like this, that AI might spell the end of the human race? Is this a new thing?
Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking?
Actually, no. This idea has been around for a while.
Here's a quotation: "Even if we could keep the machines in a subservient position, for instance, by turning off the power at strategic moments" — and I'll come back to that "turning off the power" idea later on — "we should, as a species, feel greatly humbled." So who said this?
This is Alan Turing in 1951.
Alan Turing, as you know, is the father of computer science and in many ways, the father of AI as well.
So if we think about this problem, the problem of creating something more intelligent than your own species, we might call this "the gorilla problem," because gorillas' ancestors did this a few million years ago, and now we can ask the gorillas: Was this a good idea?
So here they are having a meeting to discuss whether it was a good idea, and after a little while, they conclude, no, this was a terrible idea. Our species is in dire straits. In fact, you can see the existential sadness in their eyes.
(Laughter)
So this queasy feeling that making something smarter than your own species is maybe not a good idea -- what can we do about that?
Well, really nothing, except stop doing AI, and because of all the benefits that I mentioned and because I'm an AI researcher, I'm not having that.
I actually want to be able to keep doing AI.
So we actually need to nail down the problem a bit more.
What exactly is the problem?
Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe?
So here's another quotation: "We had better be quite sure that the purpose put into the machine is the purpose which we really desire." This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960, shortly after he watched one of the very early learning systems learn to play checkers better than its creator.
But this could equally have been said by King Midas. King Midas said, "I want everything I touch to turn to gold," and he got exactly what he asked for.
That was the purpose that he put into the machine, so to speak, and then his food and his drink and his relatives turned to gold and he died in misery and starvation.
So we'll call this "the King Midas problem" of stating an objective which is not, in fact, truly aligned with what we want.
In modern terms, we call this "the value alignment problem."
Putting in the wrong objective is not the only part of the problem.
There's another part.
If you put an objective into a machine, even something as simple as, "Fetch the coffee," the machine says to itself, "Well, how might I fail to fetch the coffee?
Someone might switch me off.
OK, I have to take steps to prevent that.
I will disable my 'off' switch.
I will do anything to defend myself against interference with this objective that I have been given." So this single-minded pursuit in a very defensive mode of an objective that is, in fact, not aligned with the true objectives of the human race -- that's the problem that we face.
And in fact, that's the high-value takeaway from this talk.
If you want to remember one thing, it's that you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.
(Laughter)
It's very simple. Just remember that. Repeat it to yourself three times a day.
(Laughter)
And in fact, this is exactly the plot of "2001: [A Space Odyssey]" HAL has an objective, a mission, which is not aligned with the objectives of the humans, and that leads to this conflict.
Now fortunately, HAL is not superintelligent.
He's pretty smart, but eventually Dave outwits him and manages to switch him off.
But we might not be so lucky.
So what are we going to do?
I'm trying to redefine AI to get away from this classical notion of machines that intelligently pursue objectives.
There are three principles involved.
The first one is a principle of altruism, if you like, that the robot's only objective is to maximize the realization of human objectives, of human values.
And by values here I don't mean touchy-feely, goody-goody values.
I just mean whatever it is that the human would prefer their life to be like.
And so this actually violates Asimov's law that the robot has to protect its own existence.
It has no interest in preserving its existence whatsoever.
The second law is a law of humility, if you like.
And this turns out to be really important to make robots safe.
It says that the robot does not know what those human values are, so it has to maximize them, but it doesn't know what they are.
And that avoids this problem of single-minded pursuit of an objective.
This uncertainty turns out to be crucial.
Now, in order to be useful to us, it has to have some idea of what we want.
It obtains that information primarily by observation of human choices, so our own choices reveal information about what it is that we prefer our lives to be like.
So those are the three principles.
Let's see how that applies to this question of: "Can you switch the machine off?" as Turing suggested.
So here's a PR2 robot. This is one that we have in our lab, and it has a big red "off" switch right on the back.
The question is: Is it going to let you switch it off? If we do it the classical way, we give it the objective of, "Fetch the coffee, I must fetch the coffee, I can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead," so obviously the PR2 has been listening to my talk, and so it says, therefore, "I must disable my 'off' switch, and probably taser all the other people in Starbucks who might interfere with me."
(Laughter)
So this seems to be inevitable, right?
This kind of failure mode seems to be inevitable, and it follows from having a concrete, definite objective.
So what happens if the machine is uncertain about the objective?
Well, it reasons in a different way.
It says, "OK, the human might switch me off, but only if I'm doing something wrong.
Well, I don't really know what wrong is, but I know that I don't want to do it." So that's the first and second principles right there. "So I should let the human switch me off." And in fact you can calculate the incentive that the robot has to allow the human to switch it off, and it's directly tied to the degree of uncertainty about the underlying objective.
And then when the machine is switched off, that third principle comes into play.
It learns something about the objectives it should be pursuing, because it learns that what it did wasn't right.
In fact, we can, with suitable use of Greek symbols, as mathematicians usually do, we can actually prove a theorem that says that such a robot is provably beneficial to the human.
You are provably better off with a machine that's designed in this way than without it.
So this is a very simple example, but this is the first step in what we're trying to do with human-compatible AI.
Now, this third principle, I think is the one that you're probably scratching your head over.
You're probably thinking, "Well, you know, I behave badly.
I don't want my robot to behave like me.
I sneak down in the middle of the night and take stuff from the fridge.
I do this and that." There's all kinds of things you don't want the robot doing.
But in fact, it doesn't quite work that way.
Just because you behave badly doesn't mean the robot is going to copy your behavior.
It's going to understand your motivations and maybe help you resist them, if appropriate.
But it's still difficult.
What we're trying to do, in fact, is to allow machines to predict for any person and for any possible life that they could live, and the lives of everybody else: Which would they prefer?
And there are many, many difficulties involved in doing this; I don't expect that this is going to get solved very quickly.
The real difficulties, in fact, are us.
As I have already mentioned, we behave badly.
In fact, some of us are downright nasty.
Now the robot, as I said, doesn't have to copy the behavior.
The robot does not have any objective of its own.
It's purely altruistic.
And it's not designed just to satisfy the desires of one person, the user, but in fact it has to respect the preferences of everybody.
So it can deal with a certain amount of nastiness, and it can even understand that your nastiness, for example, you may take bribes as a passport official because you need to feed your family and send your kids to school.
It can understand that; it doesn't mean it's going to steal.
In fact, it'll just help you send your kids to school.
We are also computationally limited.
Lee Sedol is a brilliant Go player, but he still lost.
So if we look at his actions, he took an action that lost the game.
That doesn't mean he wanted to lose.
So to understand his behavior, we actually have to invert through a model of human cognition that includes our computational limitations -- a very complicated model.
But it's still something that we can work on understanding.
Probably the most difficult part, from my point of view as an AI researcher, is the fact that there are lots of us, and so the machine has to somehow trade off, weigh up the preferences of many different people, and there are different ways to do that.
Economists, sociologists, moral philosophers have understood that, and we are actively looking for collaboration.
Let's have a look and see what happens when you get that wrong.
So you can have a conversation, for example, with your intelligent personal assistant that might be available in a few years' time.
Think of a Siri on steroids.
So Siri says, "Your wife called to remind you about dinner tonight." And of course, you've forgotten. "What? What dinner? What are you talking about?"
"Uh, your 20th anniversary at 7pm."
"I can't do that.
I'm meeting with the secretary-general at 7: 30.
How could this have happened?"
"Well, I did warn you, but you overrode my recommendation."
"Well, what am I going to do?
I can't just tell him I'm too busy. "
"Don't worry. I arranged for his plane to be delayed."
(Laughter)
"Some kind of computer malfunction."
(Laughter)
"Really? You can do that?"
"He sends his profound apologies and looks forward to meeting you for lunch tomorrow."
(Laughter)
So the values here -- there's a slight mistake going on.
This is clearly following my wife's values which is "Happy wife, happy life."
(Laughter)
It could go the other way.
You could come home after a hard day's work, and the computer says, "Long day?"
"Yes, I didn't even have time for lunch."
"You must be very hungry."
"Starving, yeah. Could you make some dinner?"
"There's something I need to tell you."
(Laughter)
"There are humans in South Sudan who are in more urgent need than you."
(Laughter)
"So I'm leaving. Make your own dinner."
(Laughter)
So we have to solve these problems, and I'm looking forward to working on them.
There are reasons for optimism.
One reason is, there is a massive amount of data.
Because remember -- I said they're going to read everything the human race has ever written.
Most of what we write about is human beings doing things and other people getting upset about it.
So there's a massive amount of data to learn from.
There's also a very strong economic incentive to get this right.
So imagine your domestic robot's at home.
You're late from work again and the robot has to feed the kids, and the kids are hungry and there's nothing in the fridge.
And the robot sees the cat.
(Laughter)
And the robot hasn't quite learned the human value function properly, so it doesn't understand the sentimental value of the cat outweighs the nutritional value of the cat.
(Laughter)
So then what happens? Well, it happens like this: "Deranged robot cooks kitty for family dinner." That one incident would be the end of the domestic robot industry.
So there's a huge incentive to get this right long before we reach superintelligent machines.
So to summarize: I'm actually trying to change the definition of AI so that we have provably beneficial machines.
And the principles are: machines that are altruistic, that want to achieve only our objectives, but that are uncertain about what those objectives are, and will watch all of us to learn more about what it is that we really want.
And hopefully in the process, we will learn to be better people. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart.
We're going to stand here a bit because I think they're setting up for our next speaker.
A couple of questions. So the idea of programming in ignorance seems intuitively really powerful.
As you get to superintelligence, what's going to stop a robot reading literature and discovering this idea that knowledge is actually better than ignorance and still just shifting its own goals and rewriting that programming?
Stuart Russell: Yes, so we want it to learn more, as I said, about our objectives.
It'll only become more certain as it becomes more correct, so the evidence is there and it's going to be designed to interpret it correctly.
It will understand, for example, that books are very biased in the evidence they contain.
They only talk about kings and princes and elite white male people doing stuff.
So it's a complicated problem, but as it learns more about our objectives it will become more and more useful to us.
CA: And you couldn't just boil it down to one law, you know, hardwired in: "if any human ever tries to switch me off, I comply. I comply."
SR: Absolutely not. That would be a terrible idea.
So imagine that you have a self-driving car and you want to send your five-year-old off to preschool.
Do you want your five-year-old to be able to switch off the car while it's driving along? Probably not. So it needs to understand how rational and sensible the person is.
The more rational the person, the more willing you are to be switched off.
If the person is completely random or even malicious, then you're less willing to be switched off.
CA: All right. Stuart, can I just say, I really, really hope you figure this out for us.
Thank you so much for that talk. That was amazing.
Do you ever think about how important the oceans are in our daily lives?
The oceans cover two-thirds of our planet.
They provide half the oxygen we breathe.
They moderate our climate.
And they provide jobs and medicine and food including 20 percent of protein to feed the entire world population.
People used to think that the oceans were so vast that they wouldn't be affected by human activities.
Well today I'm going to tell you about a serious reality that is changing our oceans called ocean acidification, or the evil twin of climate change.
Did you know that the oceans have absorbed 25 percent of all of the carbon dioxide that we have emitted to the atmosphere?
Now this is just another great service provided by the oceans since carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases that's causing climate change.
But as we keep pumping more and more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere more is dissolving into the oceans.
And this is what's changing our ocean chemistry.
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, it undergoes a number of chemical reactions.
Now lucky for you, I don't have time to get into the details of the chemistry for today,
But I'll tell you as more carbon dioxide enters the ocean, the seawater pH goes down.
And this basically means that there is an increase in ocean acidity.
And this whole process is called ocean acidification.
And it's happening alongside climate change.
Scientists have been monitoring ocean acidification for over two decades.
This figure is an important time series in Hawaii, and the top line shows steadily increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, or CO2 gas, in the atmosphere.
And this is directly as a result of human activities.
The line underneath shows the increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide that is dissolved in the surface of the ocean which you can see is increasing at the same rate as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since measurements began.
The line on the bottom shows then shows the change in chemistry.
As more carbon dioxide has entered the ocean, the seawater pH has gone down, which basically means there has been an increase in ocean acidity.
Now in Ireland, scientists are also monitoring ocean acidification -- scientists at the Marine Institute and NUI Galway.
And we, too, are seeing acidification at the same rate as these main ocean time-series sites around the world.
So it's happening right at our doorstep.
Now I'd like to give you an example of just how we collect our data to monitor a changing ocean.
Firstly we collect a lot of our samples in the middle of winter.
So as you can imagine, in the North Atlantic we get hit with some seriously stormy conditions -- so not for any of you who get a little motion sickness, but we are collecting some very valuable data.
So we lower this instrument over the side of the ship, and there are sensors that are mounted on the bottom that can tell us information about the surrounding water, such as temperature or dissolved oxygen.
And then we can collect our seawater samples in these large bottles.
So we start at the bottom, which can be over four kilometers deep just off our continental shelf, and we take samples at regular intervals right up to the surface.
We take the seawater back on the deck, and then we can either analyze them on the ship or back in the laboratory for the different chemicals parameters.
But why should we care?
How is ocean acidification going to affect all of us?
Well, here are the worrying facts.
There has already been an increase in ocean acidity of 26 percent since pre-industrial times, which is directly due to human activities.
Unless we can start slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions, we're expecting an increase in ocean acidity of 170 percent by the end of this century.
I mean this is within our children's lifetime.
This rate of acidification is 10 times faster than any acidification in our oceans for over 55 million years.
So our marine life have never, ever experienced such a fast rate of change before.
So we literally could not know how they're going to cope.
Now there was a natural acidification event millions of years ago, which was much slower than what we're seeing today.
And this coincided with a mass extinction of many marine species.
So is that what we're headed for? Well, maybe. Studies are showing some species are actually doing quite well but many are showing a negative response.
One of the big concerns is as ocean acidity increases, the concentration of carbonate ions in seawater decrease.
Now these ions are basically the building blocks for many marine species to make their shells, for example crabs or mussels, oysters.
Another example are corals. They also need these carbonate ions in seawater to make their coral structure in order to build coral reefs.
As ocean acidity increases and the concentration of carbonate ions decrease, these species first find it more difficult to make their shells.
And at even even lower levels, they can actually begin to dissolve .
This here is a pteropod, it's called a sea butterfly.
And it's an important food source in the ocean for many species, from krill to salmon right up to whales.
The shell of the pteropod was placed into seawater at a pH that we're expecting by the end of this century.
After only 45 days at this very realistic pH, you can see the shell has almost completely dissolved.
So ocean acidification could affect right up through the food chain -- and right onto our dinner plates.
I mean who here likes shellfish? Or salmon? Or many other fish species whose food source in the ocean could be affected?
just off our continental shelf, These are cold-water corals. And did you know we actually have cold-water corals in Irish waters,
And they support rich biodiversity, including some very important fisheries.
It's projected that by the end of this century, 70 percent of all known cold-water corals in the entire ocean will be surrounded by seawater that is dissolving their coral structure.
The last example I have are these healthy tropical corals.
They were placed in seawater at a pH we're expecting by the year 2100.
After six months, the coral has almost completely dissolved.
Now coral reefs support 25 percent of all marine life in the entire ocean. All marine life.
So you can see: ocean acidification is a global threat.
I have an eight-month-old baby boy.
Unless we start now to slow this down, I dread to think what our oceans will look like when he's a grown man.
We will see acidification.
We have already put too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
But we can slow this down.
We can prevent the worst-case scenario.
The only way of doing that is by reducing our carbon dioxide emissions.
This is important for both you and I, for industry, for governments.
We need to work together, slow down global warming slow down ocean acidification and help to maintain a healthy ocean and a healthy planet for our generation and for generations to come.
(Applause)
It's six o'clock in the morning, pitch black outside.
My 14-year-old son is fast asleep in his bed, sleeping the reckless, deep sleep of a teenager.
I flip on the light and physically shake the poor boy awake, because I know that, like ripping off a Band-Aid, it's better to get it over with quickly. (Laughter) I have a friend who yells "Fire!" just to rouse her sleeping teen.
And another who got so fed up that she had to dump cold water on her son's head just to get him out of bed.
Sound brutal ... but perhaps familiar?
Every morning I ask myself, "How can I — knowing what I know and doing what I do for a living — be doing this to my own son?" You see, I'm a sleep researcher. (Laughter) So I know far too much about sleep and the consequences of sleep loss.
I know that I'm depriving my son of the sleep he desperately needs as a rapidly growing teenager.
I also know that by waking him up hours before his natural biological clock tells him he's ready, I'm literally robbing him of his dreams -- the type of sleep most associated with learning, memory consolidation and emotional processing.
But it's not just my kid that's being deprived of sleep.
Sleep deprivation among American teenagers is an epidemic.
Only about one in 10 gets the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists and pediatricians.
Now, if you're thinking to yourself, "Phew, we're doing good, my kid's getting eight hours," remember, eight hours is the minimum recommendation.
You're barely passing.
Eight hours is kind of like getting a C on your report card.
There are many factors contributing to this epidemic, but a major factor preventing teens from getting the sleep they need is actually a matter of public policy.
Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat.
Across the country, many schools are starting around 7: 30am or earlier, despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that middle and high school start no earlier than 8: 30am.
These early start policies have a direct effect on how much -- or really how little sleep American teenagers are getting.
They're also pitting teenagers and their parents in a fundamentally unwinnable fight against their own bodies.
Around the time of puberty, teenagers experience a delay in their biological clock, which determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most sleepy.
This is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin.
Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around 11pm, which is two hours later than what we see in adults or younger children.
This means that waking a teenager up at 6am is the biological equivalent of waking an adult up at 4am.
On the unfortunate days when I have to wake up at 4am, I'm a zombie. Functionally useless. I can't think straight, I'm irritable, and I probably shouldn't be driving a car.
But this is how many American teenagers feel every single school day.
In fact, many of the, shall we say, unpleasant characteristics that we chalk up to being a teenager -- moodiness, irritability, laziness, depression -- could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation.
For many teens battling chronic sleep loss, their go-to strategy to compensate is consuming large quantities of caffeine in the form of venti frappuccinos, or energy drinks and shots.
So essentially, we've got an entire population of tired but wired youth.
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times know that adolescence is a period of dramatic brain development, particularly in the parts of the brain that are responsible for those higher order thinking processes, including reasoning, problem-solving and good judgment.
In other words, the very type of brain activity that's responsible for reining in those impulsive and often risky behaviors that are so characteristic of adolescence and that are so terrifying to us parents of teenagers.
They know that like the rest of us, when teenagers don't get the sleep they need, their brains, their bodies and behaviors suffer with both immediate and lasting effects.
They can't concentrate, their attention plummets and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic ADHD.
But the consequences of teen sleep loss go well beyond the classroom, sadly contributing to many of the mental health problems that skyrocket during adolescence, including substance use, depression and suicide.
In our work with teens from LA Unified School District, we found that teens with sleep problems were 55 percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month.
In another study with over 30,000 high school students, they found that for each hour of lost sleep, there was a 38 percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless, and a 58 percent increase in teen suicide attempts.
And if that's not enough, teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of physical health problems that plague our country, including obesity, heart disease and diabetes.
Then there's the risk of putting a sleep-deprived teen, with a newly minted driver's license, behind the wheel.
Studies have shown that getting five hours or less of sleep per night is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol content above the legal limit.
Advocates of sleep-friendly start times, and researchers in this area, have produced tremendous science showing the tremendous benefits of later start times.
The findings are unequivocal, and as a sleep scientist, I rarely get to speak with that kind of certainty.
Teens from districts with later start times get more sleep.
To the naysayers who may think that if schools start later, teens will just stay up later, the truth is, their bedtimes stay the same, but their wake-up times get extended, resulting in more sleep.
They're more likely to show up for school; school absences dropped by 25 percent in one district.
And they're less likely to drop out.
Not surprisingly, they do better academically.
So this has real implications for reducing the achievement gap.
Standardized test scores in math and reading go up by two to three percentage points.
That's as powerful as reducing class sizes by one-third fewer students, or replacing a so-so teacher in the classroom with a truly outstanding one.
Their mental and physical health improves, and even their families are happier.
I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little more pleasantness from our teens, and a little less crankiness?
Even their communities are safer because car crash rates go down -- a 70 percent reduction in one district.
Given these tremendous benefits, you might think, well, this is a no-brainer, right?
So why have we as a society failed to heed this call?
Often the argument against later start times goes something like this: "Why should we delay start times for teenagers?
We need to toughen them up so they're ready for the real world! "But that's like saying to the parent of a two-year-old," Don't let Johnny nap, or he won't be ready for kindergarten. "(Laughter)
Not just for students and their families, but for communities as a whole. Updating bus routes, increased transportation costs, impact on sports, care before or after school.
These are the same concerns that come up in district after district, time and again around the country as school start times are debated.
And they're legitimate concerns, but these are problems we have to work through.
They are not valid excuses for failing to do the right thing for our children, which is to start middle and high schools no earlier than 8: 30am.
And in districts around the country, big and small, who have made this change, they found that these fears are often unfounded and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits for student health and performance, and our collective public safety.
So tomorrow morning, when coincidentally we get to set our clocks back by an hour and you get that delicious extra hour of sleep, and the day seems a little longer, and a little more full of hope, think about the tremendous power of sleep.
And think about what a gift it would be for our children to be able to wake up naturally, in harmony with their own biology.
Thank you, and pleasant dreams.
I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya who is under the mistaken impression that this conference is named in honor of her father.
(Laughter)
Who am I to contradict my baby girl?
As many of you know, there's something about becoming a parent that concentrates the mind on long-term problems like climate change.
It was the birth of my daughter that inspired me to launch this climate organization, in order to counteract the excessive polarization of this issue in the United States, and to find a conservative pathway forward.
Yes, folks, a Republican climate solution is possible, and you know what?
It may even be better.
(Laughter)
Let me try to prove that to you.
What we really need is a killer app to climate policy.
In the technology world, a killer app is an application so transformative that it creates its own market, like Uber.
In the climate world, a killer app is a new solution so promising that it can break through the seemingly insurmountable barriers to progress.
These include the psychological barrier.
Climate advocates have long been encouraging their fellow citizens to make short-term sacrifices now for benefits that accrue to other people in other countries 30 or 40 years in the future.
It just doesn't fly because it runs contrary to basic human nature.
Next is the geopolitical barrier.
Under the current rules of global trade, countries have a strong incentive to free ride off the emissions reductions of other nations, instead of strengthening their own programs.
This has been the curse of every international climate negotiations, including Paris.
Finally, we have the partisan barrier.
Even the most committed countries — Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada — are nowhere near reducing emissions at the required scale and speed. Not even close. And the partisan climate divide is far more acute here in the United States.
We are fundamentally stuck, and that is why we need a killer app of climate policy to break through each of these barriers.
I'm convinced that the road to climate progress in the United States runs through the Republican Party and the business community.
So in launching the Climate Leadership Council, I started by reaching out to a who's who of Republican elder statesmen and business leaders, including James Baker and George Schultz, the two most respected Republican elder statesmen in America; Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw, the two most respected conservative economists in the country; and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton, two of the most successful and admired business leaders.
Together, we co-authored "The Conservative Case For Carbon Dividends." This represents the first time that Republican leaders put forth a concrete market-based climate solution.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
We presented our plan at the White House two weeks after President Trump moved in.
Almost every leading editorial board in the country has since endorsed our plan, and Fortune 100 companies from a wide range of industries are now getting behind it.
So by now you're probably wondering, what exactly is this plan?
Well, our carbon dividends solution is based on four pillars.
The first is a gradually rising carbon tax.
Although capitalism is a wonderful system, like many operating systems, it's prone to bugs, which, in this case, are called "market failures." By far the largest is that market prices fail to take social and environmental costs into account.
That means every market transaction is based on incorrect information.
This fundamental bug of capitalism, more than any other single factor, is to blame for our climate predicament.
Now in theory, this should be an easy problem to fix.
Economists agree that the best solution is to put a price on the carbon content of fossil fuels, otherwise known as a carbon tax.
This would discourage carbon emissions in every single economic transaction, every day of the year.
However, a carbon tax by itself has proven to be unpopular and a political dead end.
The answer is to return all the money raised directly to citizens, in the form of equal monthly dividends.
This would transform an unpopular carbon tax into a popular and populist solution, and it would also solve the underlying psychological barrier that we discussed, by giving everyone a concrete benefit in the here and now.
And these benefits would be significant.
Assuming a carbon tax rate that starts at 40 dollars per ton, a family of four would receive 2,000 dollars per year from the get-go.
According to the US Treasury Department, the bottom 70 percent of Americans would receive more in dividends than they would pay in increased energy prices.
That means 223 million Americans would win economically from solving climate change. And that --
(Applause)
is revolutionary, and could fundamentally alter climate politics.
But there's another revolutionary element here.
The amount of the dividend would grow as the carbon tax rate increases.
The more we protect our climate, the more our citizens benefit.
This creates a positive feedback loop, which is crucial, because the only way we will reach our long-term emission-reduction goals is if the carbon tax rate goes up every year.
The third pillar of our program is eliminating regulations that are no longer needed once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.
This is a key selling point to Republicans and business leaders.
So why should we trade climate regulations for a price on carbon?
Well, let me show you.
Our plan would achieve nearly twice the emissions reductions of all Obama-era climate regulations combined, and nearly three times the new baseline after President Trump repeals all of those regulations.
That assumes a carbon tax starting at 40 dollars per ton, which translates into roughly an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.
Our plan by itself would meet the high end of America's commitment under the Paris Climate Agreement, and as you can see, the emissions reductions would continue over time.
This illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution based on free markets and limited government.
We would end up with less regulation and far less pollution at the same time, while helping working-class Americans get ahead.
Doesn't that sound like something we could all support?
(Applause)
The fourth and final pillar of our program is a new climate domino effect, based on border carbon adjustments.
Now that may sound complicated, but it, too, is revolutionary, because it provides us a whole new strategy to reach a global price on carbon, which is ultimately what we need.
Let me show you an example.
Suppose Country A adopts a carbon dividends plan, and Country B does not.
Well, to level the playing field and protect the competitiveness of its industries, Country A would tax imports from Country B based on their carbon content. Fair enough. But here's where it gets really interesting, because the money raised at the border would increase the dividends going to the citizens of Country A. Well, how long do you think it would take the public in Country B to realize that that money should be going to them, and to push for a carbon dividends plan in their own land?
Add a few more countries, and we get a new climate domino effect.
Once one major country or region adopts carbon dividends with border carbon adjustments, other countries are compelled to follow suit.
One by one the dominoes fall.
And this domino effect could start anywhere.
My preference, strongly, is the United States, but it could also start in the United Kingdom, in Germany or another European country, or even in China.
Let's take China as an example.
China is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but what its leaders care even more about is transitioning their economy to consumer-led economic development.
Well, nothing could do more to hasten that transition than giving every Chinese citizen a monthly dividend.
In fact, this is the only policy solution that would enable China to meet its environmental and economic goals at the same time.
That's why this is the killer app of climate policy, because it would enable us to overcome each of the barriers we discussed earlier: the psychological barrier, the partisan barrier, and, as we've just seen, the geopolitical barrier.
All we need is a country to lead the way.
And one method of finding what you're looking for is to take out an ad.
So let's read this one together.
Wanted: country to pioneer carbon dividends plan.
Cost to country: zero.
Starting date: as soon as possible.
Advantages: most effective climate solution, popular and populist, pro-growth and pro-business, shrinks government and helps the working class.
Additional compensation: gratitude of current and future generations, including my daughter.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Just one question for you, Ted.
I'm actually not sure I've seen a conservative get a standing O at TED before that.
That's pretty cool.
The logic seems really powerful, but some people you talk to in politics say it's hard to imagine this still getting through Congress.
How are you feeling about momentum behind this?
Ted Halstead: So I understand that many are very pessimistic about what's happening in the United States with President Trump.
I'm less pessimistic; here's why. The actions of this White House, the early actions on climate, are just the first move in a complex game of climate chess.
So far it's been a repeal-only strategy; the pressure is going to mount for a replacement program, which is where we come in.
And there are three reasons why, which I'll go through real quickly.
One, the business community is fundamentally parting ways with the White House on climate change.
In fact, we're finding a number of Fortune 100 companies supporting our program.
Within two months, we're going to be announcing some really surprising names coming out in favor of this program.
Two, there is no issue in American politics where there's a more fundamental gap between the Republican base and the Republican leadership than climate change.
And three, thinking of this analogy of chess, the big decision up ahead is: Does the administration stay in Paris?
Well, let's pan it out both ways.
If it stays in Paris, as many are pushing for in the administration, well then that begs a question: What's the plan?
We have the plan.
But if they don't stay in Paris, the international pressure will be overwhelming.
Our Secretary of State will be asking other countries for NATO contributions, and they'll be saying, "No, give us our Paris commitment.
Come through on your commitments, we'll come through on ours."
So, international, business and even the Republican base will all be calling for a Republican replacement plan.
And, hopefully, we've provided one.
CA: Thank you so much, Ted.
TH: Thank you, Chris.
(Applause)
I'd like to start with a simple question: Why do the poor make so many poor decisions?
I know it's a harsh question, but take a look at the data. The poor borrow more, save less, smoke more, exercise less, drink more and eat less healthfully. Why?
Well, the standard explanation was once summed up by the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.
And she called poverty "a personality defect."
(Laughter)
A lack of character, basically.
Now, I'm sure not many of you would be so blunt.
But the idea that there's something wrong with the poor themselves is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.
Some of you may believe that the poor should be held responsible for their own mistakes.
And others may argue that we should help them to make better decisions.
But the underlying assumption is the same: there's something wrong with them.
If we could just change them, if we could just teach them how to live their lives, if they would only listen.
And to be honest, this was what I thought for a long time.
It was only a few years ago that I discovered that everything I thought I knew about poverty was wrong.
It all started when I accidentally stumbled upon a paper by a few American psychologists.
They had traveled 8,000 miles, all the way to India, for a fascinating study.
And it was an experiment with sugarcane farmers.
You should know that these farmers collect about 60 percent of their annual income all at once, right after the harvest.
This means that they're relatively poor one part of the year and rich the other.
The researchers asked them to do an IQ test before and after the harvest.
What they subsequently discovered completely blew my mind.
The farmers scored much worse on the test before the harvest.
The effects of living in poverty, it turns out, correspond to losing 14 points of IQ.
Now, to give you an idea, that's comparable to losing a night's sleep or the effects of alcoholism.
A few months later, I heard that Eldar Shafir, a professor at Princeton University and one of the authors of this study, was coming over to Holland, where I live.
So we met up in Amsterdam to talk about his revolutionary new theory of poverty.
And I can sum it up in just two words: scarcity mentality.
It turns out that people behave differently when they perceive a thing to be scarce.
And what that thing is doesn't much matter -- whether it's not enough time, money or food.
You all know this feeling, when you've got too much to do, or when you've put off breaking for lunch and your blood sugar takes a dive.
This narrows your focus to your immediate lack -- to the sandwich you've got to have now, the meeting that's starting in five minutes or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow.
So the long-term perspective goes out the window.
You could compare it to a new computer that's running 10 heavy programs at once.
It gets slower and slower, making errors.
Eventually, it freezes -- not because it's a bad computer, but because it has too much to do at once.
The poor have the same problem.
They're not making dumb decisions because they are dumb, but because they're living in a context in which anyone would make dumb decisions.
So suddenly I understood why so many of our anti-poverty programs don't work.
Investments in education, for example, are often completely ineffective.
Poverty is not a lack of knowledge.
A recent analysis of 201 studies on the effectiveness of money-management training came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all.
Now, don't get me wrong -- this is not to say the poor don't learn anything -- they can come out wiser for sure.
But it's not enough.
Or as Professor Shafir told me, "It's like teaching someone to swim and then throwing them in a stormy sea."
I still remember sitting there, perplexed.
And it struck me that we could have figured this all out decades ago.
I mean, these psychologists didn't need any complicated brain scans; they only had to measure the farmer's IQ, and IQ tests were invented more than 100 years ago.
Actually, I realized I had read about the psychology of poverty before.
George Orwell, one of the greatest writers who ever lived, experienced poverty firsthand in the 1920s. "The essence of poverty," he wrote back then, is that it "annihilates the future." And he marveled at, quote, "How people take it for granted they have the right to preach at you and pray over you as soon as your income falls below a certain level."
Now, those words are every bit as resonant today.
The big question is, of course: What can be done?
Modern economists have a few solutions up their sleeves. We could help the poor with their paperwork or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills.
This type of solution is hugely popular with modern politicians, mostly because, well, they cost next to nothing.
These solutions are, I think, a symbol of this era in which we so often treat the symptoms, but ignore the underlying cause.
So I wonder: Why don't we just change the context in which the poor live?
Or, going back to our computer analogy: Why keep tinkering around with the software when we can easily solve the problem by installing some extra memory instead?
At that point, Professor Shafir responded with a blank look.
And after a few seconds, he said, "Oh, I get it.
You mean you want to just hand out more money to the poor to eradicate poverty.
Uh, sure, that'd be great.
But I'm afraid that brand of left-wing politics you've got in Amsterdam -- it doesn't exist in the States."
But is this really an old-fashioned, leftist idea?
I remembered reading about an old plan -- something that has been proposed by some of history's leading thinkers.
The philosopher Thomas More first hinted at it in his book, "Utopia," more than 500 years ago.
And its proponents have spanned the spectrum from the left to the right, from the civil rights campaigner, Martin Luther King, to the economist Milton Friedman.
And it's an incredibly simple idea: basic income guarantee.
What it is? Well, that's easy. It's a monthly grant, enough to pay for your basic needs: food, shelter, education.
It's completely unconditional, so no one's going to tell you what you have to do for it, and no one's going to tell you what you have to do with it.
The basic income is not a favor, but a right.
There's absolutely no stigma attached.
So as I learned about the true nature of poverty, I couldn't stop wondering: Is this the idea we've all been waiting for?
Could it really be that simple?
And in the three years that followed, I read everything I could find about basic income.
I researched the dozens of experiments that have been conducted all over the globe, and it didn't take long before I stumbled upon a story of a town that had done it -- had actually eradicated poverty.
But then ... nearly everyone forgot about it.
This story starts in Dauphin, Canada.
In 1974, everybody in this small town was guaranteed a basic income, ensuring that no one fell below the poverty line.
At the start of the experiment, an army of researchers descended on the town.
For four years, all went well.
But then a new government was voted into power, and the new Canadian cabinet saw little point to the expensive experiment.
So when it became clear there was no money left to analyze the results, the researchers decided to pack their files away in some 2,000 boxes.
Twenty-five years went by, and then Evelyn Forget, a Canadian professor, found the records.
For three years, she subjected the data to all manner of statistical analysis, and no matter what she tried, the results were the same every time: the experiment had been a resounding success.
Evelyn Forget discovered that the people in Dauphin had not only become richer but also smarter and healthier.
The school performance of kids improved substantially.
The hospitalization rate decreased by as much as 8.5 percent.
Domestic violence incidents were down, as were mental health complaints.
And people didn't quit their jobs.
The only ones who worked a little less were new mothers and students -- who stayed in school longer.
Similar results have since been found in countless other experiments around the globe, from the US to India.
So... here's what I've learned.
When it comes to poverty, we, the rich, should stop pretending we know best. We should stop sending shoes and teddy bears to the poor, to people we have never met. And we should get rid of the vast industry of paternalistic bureaucrats when we could simply hand over their salaries to the poor they're supposed to help.
(Applause)
Because, I mean, the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self-appointed experts think they need.
Just imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers, like George Orwell, are now withering away in scarcity.
Imagine how much energy and talent we would unleash if we got rid of poverty once and for all.
I believe that a basic income would work like venture capital for the people.
And we can't afford not to do it, because poverty is hugely expensive.
Just look at the cost of child poverty in the US, for example.
It's estimated at 500 billion dollars each year, in terms of higher health care spending, higher dropout rates, and more crime.
Now, this is an incredible waste of human potential.
But let's talk about the elephant in the room.
How could we ever afford a basic income guarantee?
Well, it's actually a lot cheaper than you may think.
What they did in Dauphin is finance it with a negative income tax.
This means that your income is topped up as soon as you fall below the poverty line.
And in that scenario, according to our economists' best estimates, for a net cost of 175 billion -- a quarter of US military spending, one percent of GDP -- you could lift all impoverished Americans above the poverty line.
You could actually eradicate poverty.
Now, that should be our goal.
(Applause)
The time for small thoughts and little nudges is past.
I really believe that the time has come for radical new ideas, and basic income is so much more than just another policy.
It is also a complete rethink of what work actually is.
And in that sense, it will not only free the poor, but also the rest of us.
Nowadays, millions of people feel that their jobs have little meaning or significance.
A recent poll among 230,000 employees in 142 countries found that only 13 percent of workers actually like their job.
And another poll found that as much as 37 percent of British workers have a job that they think doesn't even need to exist.
It's like Brad Pitt says in "Fight Club," "Too often we're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need."
(Laughter)
Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not talking about the teachers and the garbagemen and the care workers here.
If they stopped working, we'd be in trouble.
I'm talking about all those well-paid professionals with excellent résumés who earn their money doing ... strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings while brainstorming the value add-on of disruptive co-creation in the network society.
(Laughter)
Or something like that. Just imagine again how much talent we're wasting, simply because we tell our kids they'll have to "earn a living." Or think of what a math whiz working at Facebook lamented a few years ago: "The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads."
I'm a historian. And if history teaches us anything, it is that things could be different.
There is nothing inevitable about the way we structured our society and economy right now.
Ideas can and do change the world.
And I think that especially in the past few years, it has become abundantly clear that we cannot stick to the status quo -- that we need new ideas.
I know that many of you may feel pessimistic about a future of rising inequality, xenophobia and climate change.
But it's not enough to know what we're against.
We also need to be for something.
Martin Luther King didn't say, "I have a nightmare."
(Laughter)
He had a dream.
(Applause)
So... here's my dream: I believe in a future where the value of your work is not determined by the size of your paycheck, but by the amount of happiness you spread and the amount of meaning you give.
I believe in a future where the point of education is not to prepare you for another useless job but for a life well-lived.
I believe in a future where an existence without poverty is not a privilege but a right we all deserve. So here we are. Here we are. We've got the research, we've got the evidence and we've got the means.
Now, more than 500 years after Thomas More first wrote about a basic income, and 100 years after George Orwell discovered the true nature of poverty, we all need to change our worldview, because poverty is not a lack of character.
Poverty is a lack of cash.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I have a confession. I have been in an affair since I was 17 years old.
I wish I could talk about butterflies in my stomach or maps I drew on the ground when I think about this affair, but I cannot.
but I cannot. I wish I could talk about sweet words spoken or gifts that I received from this affair,
All I can tell you about is the aftermath, about days I spent constantly asking: Why, why, why me?
I remember how it all began.
I was in my final year of high school, and my class had just won in sports, so we were singing and dancing and hugging each other.
I went and took a shower.
Then I went for dinner.
And when I sat down to eat, my teeth started chattering, and so I couldn't put the spoon in my mouth.
I rushed to the nurse's office, and because I couldn't talk, I just pointed at my mouth.
She didn't know what was happening, so she told me to lie down, and it worked -- after a few minutes, the chattering stopped.
I was about to dash out, and she told me -- no, she insisted -- that I go up to the dormitories to sleep.
Here I was in my final year of high school, just a few months from doing my end of high school exams and a few days from doing a set of exams we call here in Kenya "mocks," which are somehow meant to gauge how prepared one is for the final exams.
There is no way I was going to sleep and let a set of exams mock me.
I went to class, sat down, took my Kenyan history notes, and there I was, down Kenyan coastal town, with the great Mekatilili wa Menza, the Giriama woman who led her people against British colonial rule.
Then, without any notice, my left hand started jerking, and it was as if I was marking imaginary papers.
In and out it went, and with every stroke, one by one, my classmates stopped concentrating on their reading and started looking at me.
And I tried really hard to stop it, but I couldn't, because it had a life of its own.
And then, when it was sure everybody was looking at us, in its final show and official introduction, I had my first full-blown seizure, which was the beginning of what has been a 15-year-long affair.
Seizures are the trademark characteristic for most types of epilepsy, and every first-ever seizure needs to be assessed by a doctor to determine if one has epilepsy or if it's a symptom of something else.
In my case, it was confirmed that I had epilepsy.
I spent a large chunk of my time in hospital and at home, and only went back to do my final exams.
I had seizures in between papers, but managed to get good enough grades to be admitted for an actuarial science degree at the University of Nairobi.
(Applause)
Unfortunately, I had to drop out in my second year.
I didn't have good enough coping skills and a support community around me.
I was lucky enough to get a job, but I was fired from that job when I had a seizure in the workplace.
So I found myself in a space where I was constantly asking myself why this had to happen to me.
I lived in denial for a long time, and the denial was maybe because of the things that had happened, dropping out of school and being fired from my job.
Or maybe it was because of the things I had heard about epilepsy and about people living with epilepsy: that they would never live on their own; that they would never travel on their own or even get work; that they were outcasts, with a spirit in them that they needed to be delivered from.
And so the more I thought about these things, the more my seizures became, and I spent days with my legs locked, my speech became blurred and on days on end, this is how I'd be.
Two or three days after a seizure, my head and my hand would still be twitching.
I felt lost, like I'd lost everything, and sometimes, even the will to live.
I had so much frustration in me. And so I started writing, because the people around me didn't have answers to the questions that I had.
And so I wrote my fears and my doubts.
I wrote about my good days and my bad days and my really ugly days, and I shared them on a blog.
And before long, I began to be seen and heard by people who had epilepsy and their families, and even those who did not have the diagnosis.
And I moved from that girl who constantly asked why me to one who not only self-advocates, but does it for those who are yet to find their voices.
(Applause)
My seizures are greatly reduced, from two to three times a day, to sometimes two to three times in one year.
I went on --
(Applause)
I went on to employ five people, when I began what was Kenya's first free mental health and epilepsy support line.
And I travel --
(Applause)
And I travel to speak about my affair, all these things that I had been told people like me living with epilepsy could never be able to do.
Every year, a population as big as 80 percent of Nairobi gets diagnosed with epilepsy across the globe.
And they, like me, go through the emotions of stigma and exclusion.
And so I have made it my life journey to keep these conversations going, and I keep confessing about my affair so that those people who do not have the diagnosis might know and might have a constant reminder that it is alright to engage with people like us, that as long as they pull down the walls of stigma and exclusion, that we, just like them, can be able to take anything life throws at us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This story begins in 1985, when at age 22, I became the World Chess Champion after beating Anatoly Karpov.
Earlier that year, I played what is called simultaneous exhibition against 32 of the world's best chess-playing machines in Hamburg, Germany.
I won all the games, and then it was not considered much of a surprise that I could beat 32 computers at the same time.
To me, that was the golden age.
(Laughter)
Machines were weak, and my hair was strong.
(Laughter)
Just 12 years later, I was fighting for my life against just one computer in a match called by the cover of "Newsweek" "The Brain's Last Stand." No pressure.
(Laughter)
From mythology to science fiction, human versus machine has been often portrayed as a matter of life and death.
John Henry, called the steel-driving man in the 19th century African American folk legend, was pitted in a race against a steam-powered hammer bashing a tunnel through mountain rock.
John Henry's legend is a part of a long historical narrative pitting humanity versus technology.
And this competitive rhetoric is standard now.
We are in a race against the machines, in a fight or even in a war. Jobs are being killed off. People are being replaced as if they had vanished from the Earth.
It's enough to think that the movies like "The Terminator" or "The Matrix" are nonfiction.
There are very few instances of an arena where the human body and mind can compete on equal terms with a computer or a robot.
Actually, I wish there were a few more.
Instead, it was my blessing and my curse to literally become the proverbial man in the man versus machine competition that everybody is still talking about.
In the most famous human-machine competition since John Henry, I played two matches against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.
Nobody remembers that I won the first match --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
In Philadelphia, before losing the rematch the following year in New York.
But I guess that's fair.
There is no day in history, special calendar entry for all the people who failed to climb Mt. Everest before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top.
And in 1997, I was still the world champion when chess computers finally came of age. I was Mt. Everest, and Deep Blue reached the summit.
I should say of course, not that Deep Blue did it, but its human creators -- Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.
Hats off to them.
As always, machine's triumph was a human triumph, something we tend to forget when humans are surpassed by our own creations.
Deep Blue was victorious, but was it intelligent?
No, no it wasn't, at least not in the way Alan Turing and other founders of computer science had hoped.
It turned out that chess could be crunched by brute force, once hardware got fast enough and algorithms got smart enough.
Although by the definition of the output, grandmaster-level chess, Deep Blue was intelligent.
But even at the incredible speed, 200 million positions per second, Deep Blue's method provided little of the dreamed-of insight into the mysteries of human intelligence.
Soon, machines will be taxi drivers and doctors and professors, but will they be "intelligent?" I would rather leave these definitions to the philosophers and to the dictionary.
What really matters is how we humans feel about living and working with these machines.
When I first met Deep Blue in 1996 in February, I had been the world champion for more than 10 years, and I had played 182 world championship games and hundreds of games against other top players in other competitions.
I knew what to expect from my opponents and what to expect from myself.
I was used to measure their moves and to gauge their emotional state by watching their body language and looking into their eyes.
And then I sat across the chessboard from Deep Blue.
I immediately sensed something new, something unsettling.
You might experience a similar feeling the first time you ride in a driverless car or the first time your new computer manager issues an order at work.
But when I sat at that first game, I couldn't be sure what is this thing capable of.
Technology can advance in leaps, and IBM had invested heavily.
I lost that game.
And I couldn't help wondering, might it be invincible? Was my beloved game of chess over?
These were human doubts, human fears, and the only thing I knew for sure was that my opponent Deep Blue had no such worries at all.
(Laughter)
I fought back after this devastating blow to win the first match, but the writing was on the wall.
I eventually lost to the machine but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry who won but died with his hammer in his hand. [John Henry Died with a Hammer in His Hand Palmer C. Hayden] [The Museum of African American Art, Los Angeles] It turned out that the world of chess still wanted to have a human chess champion.
And even today, when a free chess app on the latest mobile phone is stronger than Deep Blue, people are still playing chess, even more than ever before.
Doomsayers predicted that nobody would touch the game that could be conquered by the machine, and they were wrong, proven wrong, but doomsaying has always been a popular pastime when it comes to technology.
What I learned from my own experience is that we must face our fears if we want to get the most out of our technology, and we must conquer those fears if we want to get the best out of our humanity.
While licking my wounds, I got a lot of inspiration from my battles against Deep Blue.
As the old Russian saying goes, if you can't beat them, join them.
Then I thought, what if I could play with a computer — together with a computer at my side, combining our strengths, human intuition plus machine's calculation, human strategy, machine tactics, human experience, machine's memory.
Could it be the perfect game ever played?
My idea came to life in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess when I played this human-plus-machine competition against another elite player.
But in this first experiment, we both failed to combine human and machine skills effectively.
Advanced Chess found its home on the internet, and in 2005, a so-called freestyle chess tournament produced a revelation.
A team of grandmasters and top machines participated, but the winners were not grandmasters, not a supercomputer.
The winners were a pair of amateur American chess players operating three ordinary PCs at the same time.
Their skill of coaching their machines effectively counteracted the superior chess knowledge of their grandmaster opponents and much greater computational power of others.
And I reached this formulation. A weak human player plus a machine plus a better process is superior to a very powerful machine alone, but more remarkably, is superior to a strong human player plus machine and an inferior process.
This convinced me that we would need better interfaces to help us coach our machines towards more useful intelligence.
Human plus machine isn't the future, it's the present.
Everybody that's used online translation to get the gist of a news article from a foreign newspaper, knowing its far from perfect.
Then we use our human experience to make sense out of that, and then the machine learns from our corrections.
This model is spreading and investing in medical diagnosis, security analysis.
The machine crunches data, calculates probabilities, gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent, making it easier for analysis and decision-making of the human party.
But you are not going to send your kids to school in a self-driving car with 90 percent accuracy, even with 99 percent.
So we need a leap forward to add a few more crucial decimal places.
Twenty years after my match with Deep Blue, second match, this sensational "The Brain's Last Stand" headline has become commonplace as intelligent machines move in every sector, seemingly every day.
But unlike in the past, when machines replaced farm animals, manual labor, now they are coming after people with college degrees and political influence.
And as someone who fought machines and lost, I am here to tell you this is excellent, excellent news.
Eventually, every profession will have to feel these pressures or else it will mean humanity has ceased to make progress.
We don't get to choose when and where technological progress stops.
We cannot slow down.
In fact, we have to speed up.
Our technology excels at removing difficulties and uncertainties from our lives, and so we must seek out ever more difficult, ever more uncertain challenges. Machines have calculations. We have understanding. Machines have instructions. We have purpose. Machines have objectivity. We have passion. We should not worry about what our machines can do today.
Instead, we should worry about what they still cannot do today, because we will need the help of the new, intelligent machines to turn our grandest dreams into reality.
And if we fail, if we fail, it's not because our machines are too intelligent, or not intelligent enough.
If we fail, it's because we grew complacent and limited our ambitions.
Our humanity is not defined by any skill, like swinging a hammer or even playing chess.
There's one thing only a human can do. That's dream. So let us dream big.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Vanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa, daughter of Annette, daughter of Olympia, daughter of Melvina, daughter of Katie, born 1878, Parish County, Louisiana.
T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan, daughter of Carol, daughter of Letha, daughter of Willie, daughter of Sarah, born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky.
VG: And in the tradition of our families, the great oral tradition of almost every black church we know honoring the culture from which we draw so much power, we're gonna start the way our mommas and grandmas would want us to start.
TMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth, the meditation of our hearts, be acceptable in thy sight, oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer.
VG: We call the names and rituals of our ancestors into this room today because from them we received a powerful blueprint for survival, strategies and tactics for healing carried across oceans by African women, passed down to generations of black women in America who used those skills to navigate institutions of slavery and state-sponsored discrimination in order that we might stand on this stage.
We walk in the footsteps of those women, our foremothers, legends like Ella Baker, Septima Clark, Fannie Lou Hamer, from whom we learned the power of organizing after she would had single-handedly registered 60,000 voters in Jim Crow Mississippi.
TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people, so if you can imagine me and Vanessa inspiring 60,000 women to walk with us last year, we were fired up.
But today, 100,000 black women and girls stand on this stage with us.
We are committed to healing ourselves, to lacing up our sneakers, to walking out of our front door every single day for total healing and transformation in our communities, because we understand that we are in the footsteps of a civil rights legacy like no other time before, and that we are facing a health crisis like never ever before.
And so we've had a lot of moments, great moments, including the time we had on our pajamas, we were working on our computer and Michelle Obama emailed us and invited us to the White House, and we thought it was spam.
But this moment here is an opportunity.
It is an opportunity that we don't take for granted, and so we thought long and hard about how we would use it.
Would we talk to the women we hope to inspire, a million in the next year, or would we talk to you?
We decided to talk to you, and to talk to you about a question that we get all the time, so that the millions of women who hopefully will watch this will never have to answer it again.
It is: Why are black women dying faster and at higher rates than any other group of people in America from preventable, obesity-related diseases?
The question hurts me. I'm shaking a little bit. It feels value-laden. It hurts my body because the weight represents so much.
But we're going to talk about it and invite you into an inside conversation today because it is necessary, and because we need you.
VG: Each night, before the first day of school, my grandmother would sit me next to the stove and with expert precision use a hot comb to press my hair.
My grandmother was legendary, big, loud.
She filled up a room with laughter and oftentimes curse words.
She cooked a mean peach cobbler, had 11 children, a house full of grandchildren, and like every black woman I know, like most all women I know, she had prioritized the care of others over caring for herself.
We measured her strength by her capacity to endure pain and suffering.
We celebrated her for it, and our choice would prove to be deadly.
One night after pressing my hair before the first day of eighth grade, my grandmother went to bed and never woke up, dead at 66 years old from a heart attack.
By the time I would graduate college, I would lose two more beloved family members to chronic disease: my aunt Diane, dead at 55, my aunt Tricia, dead at 63.
After living with these losses, the hole that they left, I decided to calculate the life expectancy of the women in my family.
Staring back at me, the number 65.
I knew I could not sit by and watch another woman I loved die an early death.
TMD: So we don't usually put our business in the streets.
Let's just put that out there.
But I have to tell you the statistics.
Black women are dying at alarming rates, and I used to be a classroom teacher, and I was at South Atlanta High School, and I remember standing in front of my classroom, and I remember a statistic that half of black girls will get diabetes unless diet and levels of activity change.
Half of the girls in my classroom.
So I couldn't teach anymore.
So I started taking girls hiking, which is why we're called GirlTrek, but Vanessa was like, that is not going to move the dial on the health crisis; it's cute.
She was like, it's a cute hiking club.
So what we thought is if we could rally a million of their mothers ... 82 percent of black women are over a healthy weight right now.
53 percent of us are obese.
But the number that I cannot, that I cannot get out of my head is that every single day in America, 137 black women die from a preventable disease, heart disease.
That's every 11 minutes.
137 is more than gun violence, cigarette smoking and HIV combined, every day.
It is roughly the amount of people that were on my plane from New Jersey to Vancouver. Can you imagine that? A plane filled with black women crashing to the ground every day, and no one is talking about it.
VG: So the question that you're all asking yourselves right now is why? Why are black women dying?
We asked ourselves that same question.
Why is what's out there not working for them?
Private weight loss companies, government interventions, public health campaigns.
I'm going to tell you why: because they focus on weight loss or looking good in skinny jeans without acknowledging the trauma that black women hold in our bellies and bones, that has been embedded in our very DNA.
The best advice from hospitals and doctors, the best medications from pharmaceutical companies to treat the congestive heart failure of my grandmother didn't work because they didn't acknowledge the systemic racism that she had dealt with since birth.
(Applause)
A divestment in schools, discriminatory housing practices, predatory lending, a crack cocaine epidemic, mass incarceration putting more black bodies behind bars than were owned at the height of slavery.
But GirlTrek does. For black women whose bodies are buckling under the weight of systems never designed to support them, GirlTrek is a lifeline.
August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball, a member of GirlTrek in Detroit, received the news that too many black mothers have received.
Her son Norman, 23 years old, a father of two, was gunned down while on an afternoon drive.
Imagine the grief that overcomes your body in that moment, the immobilizing fear.
Now, know this, that just days after laying her son to rest, Danita Kimball posted online, "I don't know what to do or how to move forward, but my sisters keep telling me I need to walk, so I will." And then just days after that, "I got my steps in today for my baby Norm.
It felt good to be out there, to walk."
TMD: Walking through pain is what we have always done.
My mom, she's in the middle right there, my mom desegregated her high school in 1955.
Her mom walked down the steps of an abandoned school bus where she raised 11 kids as a sharecropper.
And her mom stepped onto Indian territory fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.
And her mom walked her man to the door as he went off to fight in the Kentucky Colored Regiment, the Civil War.
They were born slaves but they wouldn't die slaves.
Change-making, it's in my blood.
It's what I do, and this health crisis ain't nothing compared to the road we have traveled.
(Applause)
So it's like James Cleveland.
I don't feel no ways tired, so we got to work.
We started looking at models of change. We looked all over the world.
We needed something not only that was a part of our cultural inheritance like walking, but something that was scalable, something that was high-impact, something that we could replicate across this country.
So we studied models like Wangari Maathai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for inspiring women to plant 50 million trees in Kenya. She brought Kenya back from the brink of environmental devastation.
We studied these systems of change, and we looked at walking scientifically.
And what we learned is that walking just 30 minutes a day can single-handedly decrease 50 percent of your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, even Alzheimer's and dementia.
We know that walking is the single most powerful thing that a woman can do for her health, so we knew we were on to something, because from Harriet Tubman to the women in Montgomery, when black women walk, things change.
(Applause) VG: So how did we take this simple idea of walking and start a revolution that would catch a fire in neighborhoods across America?
We used the best practices of the Civil Rights Movement.
We huddled up in church basements.
We did grapevine information sharing through beauty salons.
We empowered and trained mothers to stand on the front lines.
We took our message directly to the streets, and women responded.
Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga, Chrysantha in Detroit, Onika in New Orleans, women with difficult names and difficult stories join GirlTrek every day and commit to walking as a practice of self-care.
Once walking, those women get to organizing, first their families, then their communities, to walk and talk and solve problems together.
They walk and notice the abandoned building. They walk and notice the lack of sidewalks, the lack of green space, and they say, "No more." Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia, who after walking daily past an abandoned building in her neighborhood, decided, "I'm not waiting.
Let me rally my team. Let me grab some supplies. Let me do what no one else has done for me and my community."
TMD: We know one woman can make a difference, because one woman has already changed the world, and her name is Harriet Tubman.
And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.
I'm obsessed with her, and I used to be a history teacher.
I will not tell you the whole history.
I will tell you four things.
So I used to have an old Saab -- the kind of canvas top that drips on your head when it rains -- and I drove all the way down to the eastern shore of Maryland, and when I stepped on the dirt that Harriet Tubman made her first escape, I knew she was a woman just like we are and that we could do what she had done, and we learned four things from Harriet Tubman.
The first one: do not wait.
Walk right now in the direction of your healthiest, most fulfilled life, because self-care is a revolutionary act.
Number two: when you learn the way forward, come back and get a sister.
So in our case, start a team with your friends -- your friends, your family, your church.
Number three: rally your allies.
Every single person in this room is complicit in a Tubman-inspired takeover.
And number four: find joy.
The most underreported fact of Harriet Tubman is that she lived to be 93 years old, and she didn't live just an ordinary life; uh-uh.
She was standing up for the good guys.
She married a younger man.
She adopted a child.
I'm not kidding. She lived. And I drove up to her house of freedom in upstate New York, and she had planted apple trees, and when I was there on a Sunday, they were blooming.
Do you call it -- do they bloom?
The apples were in season, and I was thinking, she left fruit for us, the legacy of Harriet Tubman, every single year.
And we know that we are Harriet, and we know that there is a Harriet in every community in America.
VG: We also know that there's a Harriet in every community across the globe, and that they could learn from our Tubman Doctrine, as we call it, the four steps.
Imagine the possibilities beyond the neighborhoods of Oakland and Newark, to the women working rice fields in Vietnam, tea fields in Sri Lanka, the women on the mountainsides in Guatemala, the indigenous reservations throughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.
We believe that women walking and talking together to solve their problems is a global solution.
TMD: And I'll leave you with this, because we also believe it can become the center of social justice again.
Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.
We had an organizer training, and I was leaving and I got on the airplane, and I saw someone I knew, so I waved, and as I'm waiting in that long line that you guys know, waiting for people to put their stuff away, I looked back and I realized I didn't know the woman but I recognized her.
And so I blew her a kiss because it was Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin's mom, and she whispered "thank you" back to me.
And I can't help but wonder what would happen if there were groups of women walking on Trayvon's block that day, or what would happen in the South Side of Chicago every day if there were groups of women and mothers and aunts and cousins walking, or along the polluted rivers of Flint, Michigan.
I believe that walking can transform our communities, because it's already starting to.
VG: We believe that the personal is political.
Our walking is for healing, for joy, for fresh air, quiet time, to connect and disconnect, to worship.
But it's also walking so we can be healthy enough to stand on the front lines for change in our communities, and it is our call to action to every black woman listening, every black woman in earshot of our voice, every black woman who you know.
Think about it: the woman working front desk reception at your job, the woman who delivers your mail, your neighbor -- our call to action to them, to join us on the front lines for change in your community.
TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment and why it's so important for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I. It's because it's not always easy for us, and in fact, we have both seen really, really dark days, from the hate speech to the summer of police brutality and violence that we saw last year, to even losing one of our walkers, Sandy Bland, who died in police custody.
But the most courageous thing we do every day is we practice faith that goes beyond the facts, and we put feet to our prayers every single day, and when we get overwhelmed, we think of the words of people like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate, who says, "Morgan, where is your fire?
Where is the fire that burned holes through slave ships to make us breathe?
Where is the fire that turned guts into chitlins, that took rhythms and make jazz, that took sit-ins and marches and made us jump boundaries and barriers?
You've got to find it and pass it on."
So this is us finding our fire and passing it on to you.
So please, stand with us, walk with us as we rally a million women to reclaim the streets of the 50 highest need communities in this country.
We thank you so much for this opportunity.
(Applause)
I want to share with you something my father taught me: no condition is permanent.
It's a lesson he shared with me again and again, and I learned it to be true the hard way.
Here I am in my fourth-grade class.
This is my yearbook picture taken in my class in school in Monrovia, Liberia.
My parents migrated from India to West Africa in the 1970s, and I had the privilege of growing up there.
I was nine years old, I loved kicking around a soccer ball, and I was a total math and science geek.
I was living the kind of life that, really, any child would dream of.
But no condition is permanent.
On Christmas Eve in 1989, civil war erupted in Liberia.
The war started in the rural countryside, and within months, rebel armies had marched towards our hometown.
My school shut down, and when the rebel armies captured the only international airport, people started panicking and fleeing.
My mom came knocking one morning and said, "Raj, pack your things -- we have to go." We were rushed to the center of town, and there on a tarmac, we were split into two lines.
I stood with my family in one line, and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch of a rescue plane.
And there on a bench, I was sitting with my heart racing.
As I looked out the open hatch, I saw hundreds of Liberians in another line, children strapped to their backs.
When they tried to jump in with us, I watched soldiers restrain them.
They were not allowed to flee.
We were the lucky ones. We lost what we had, but we resettled in America, and as immigrants, we benefitted from the community of supporters that rallied around us.
They took my family into their home, they mentored me.
And they helped my dad start a clothing shop.
I'd visit my father on weekends as a teenager to help him sell sneakers and jeans.
no condition is permanent. And every time business would get bad, he'd remind me of that mantra:
That mantra and my parents' persistence and that community of supporters made it possible for me to go through college and eventually to medical school.
I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war, but because of them, I had a chance to pursue my dream to become a doctor.
My condition had changed.
It had been 15 years since I escaped that airfield, but the memory of those two lines had not escaped my mind.
I was a medical student in my mid-20s, and I wanted to go back to see if I could serve the people we'd left behind.
But when I got back, what I found was utter destruction.
The war had left us with just 51 doctors to serve a country of four million people.
It would be like the city of San Francisco having just 10 doctors.
So if you got sick in the city where those few doctors remain, you might stand a chance.
But if you got sick in the remote, rural rainforest communities, where you could be days from the nearest clinic -- I was seeing my patients die from conditions no one should die from, all because they were getting to me too late.
Imagine you have a two-year-old who wakes up one morning with a fever, and you realize she could have malaria, and you know the only way to get her the medicine she needs would be to take her to the riverbed, get in a canoe, paddle to the other side and then walk for up to two days through the forest just to reach the nearest clinic.
One billion people live in the world's most remote communities, and despite the advances we've made in modern medicine and technology, our innovations are not reaching the last mile.
These communities have been left behind, because they've been thought too hard to reach and too difficult to serve.
Illness is universal; access to care is not.
And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.
No one should die because they live too far from a doctor or clinic.
No condition should be permanent.
And help in this case didn't come from the outside, it actually came from within.
It came from the communities themselves.
Meet Musu. Way out in rural Liberia, where most girls have not had a chance to finish primary school, Musu had been persistent.
At the age of 18, she completed high school, and she came back to her community.
She saw that none of the children were getting treatment for the diseases they needed treatment for -- deadly diseases, like malaria and pneumonia.
So she signed up to be a volunteer.
There are millions of volunteers like Musu in rural parts around our world, and we got to thinking -- community members like Musu could actually help us solve a puzzle.
Our health care system is structured in such a way that the work of diagnosing disease and prescribing medicines is limited to a team of nurses and doctors like me.
But nurses and doctors are concentrated in cities, so rural communities like Musu's have been left behind.
So we started asking some questions: What if we could reorganize the medical care system?
What if we could have community members like Musu be a part or even be the center of our medical team?
What if Musu could help us bring health care from clinics in cities to the doorsteps of her neighbors?
Musu was 48 when I met her.
And despite her amazing talent and grit, she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.
So what if technology could support her?
What if we could invest in her with real training, equip her with real medicines, and have her have a real job?
Well, in 2007, I was trying to answer these questions, and my wife and I were getting married that year. We asked our relatives to forgo the wedding registry gifts and instead donate some money so we could have some start-up money to launch a nonprofit.
I promise you, I'm a lot more romantic than that.
(Laughter)
We ended up raising $6,000, teamed up with some Liberians and Americans and launched a nonprofit called Last Mile Health.
Our goal is to bring a health worker within reach of everyone, everywhere.
We designed a three-step process -- train, equip and pay -- to invest more deeply in volunteers like Musu to become paraprofessionals, to become community health workers.
First we trained Musu to prevent, diagnose and treat the top 10 diseases afflicting families in her village.
A nurse supervisor visited her every month to coach her.
We equipped her with modern medical technology, like this $1 malaria rapid test, and put it in a backpack full of medicines like this to treat infections like pneumonia, and crucially, a smartphone, to help her track and report on epidemics.
Last, we recognized the dignity in Musu's work.
With the Liberian government, we created a contract, paid her and gave her the chance to have a real job. And she's amazing.
Musu has learned over 30 medical skills, from screening children for malnutrition, to assessing the cause of a child's cough with a smartphone, to supporting people with HIV and providing follow-up care to patients who've lost their limbs.
Working as part of our team, working as paraprofessionals, community health workers can help ensure that a lot of what your family doctor would do reaches the places that most family doctors could never go.
One of my favorite things to do is to care for patients with community health workers.
So last year I was visiting A.B., and like Musu, A.B. had had a chance to go to school.
He was in middle school, in the eighth grade, when his parents died.
He became an orphan and had to drop out.
Last year, we hired and trained A.B. as a community health worker.
And while he was making door to door house calls, he met this young boy named Prince, whose mother had had trouble breastfeeding him, and by the age of six months, Prince had started to waste away.
A.B. had just been taught how to use this color-coded measuring tape that wraps around the upper arm of a child to diagnose malnutrition.
A.B. noticed that Prince was in the red zone, which meant he had to be hospitalized.
So A.B. took Prince and his mother to the river, got in a canoe and paddled for four hours to get to the hospital.
Later, after Prince was discharged, A.B. taught mom how to feed baby a food supplement.
A few months ago, A.B. took me to visit Prince, and he's a chubby little guy.
(Laughter)
He's meeting his milestones, he's pulled himself up to a stand, and is even starting to say a few words.
I'm so inspired by these community health workers.
I often ask them why they do what they do, and when I asked A.B., he said, "Doc, since I dropped out of school, this is the first time I'm having a chance to hold a pen to write.
My brain is getting fresh."
The stories of A.B. and Musu have taught me something fundamental about being human.
Our will to serve others can actually help us transform our own conditions.
I was so moved by how powerful the will to serve our neighbors can be a few years ago, when we faced a global catastrophe.
In December 2013, something happened in the rainforests across the border from us in Guinea.
A toddler named Emile fell sick with vomiting, fever and diarrhea.
He lived in an area where the roads were sparse and there had been massive shortages of health workers.
Emile died, and a few weeks later his sister died, and a few weeks later his mother died.
And this disease would spread from one community to another.
And it wasn't until three months later that the world recognized this as Ebola.
When every minute counted, we had already lost months, and by then the virus had spread like wildfire all across West Africa, and eventually to other parts of the world.
Businesses shut down, airlines started canceling routes.
At the height of the crisis, when we were told that 1.4 million people could be infected, when we were told that most of them would die, when we had nearly lost all hope, I remember standing with a group of health workers in the rainforest where an outbreak had just happened.
We were helping train and equip them to put on the masks, the gloves and the gowns that they needed to keep themselves safe from the virus while they were serving their patients.
I remember the fear in their eyes.
And I remember staying up at night, terrified if I'd made the right call to keep them in the field.
When Ebola threatened to bring humanity to its knees, Liberia's community health workers didn't surrender to fear.
They did what they had always done: they answered the call to serve their neighbors.
Community members across Liberia learned the symptoms of Ebola, teamed up with nurses and doctors to go door-to-door to find the sick and get them into care.
They tracked thousands of people who had been exposed to the virus and helped break the chain of transmission.
Some ten thousand community health workers risked their own lives to help hunt down this virus and stop it in its tracks.
(Applause)
Today, Ebola has come under control in West Africa, and we've learned a few things.
We've learned that blind spots in rural health care can lead to hot spots of disease, and that places all of us at greater risk.
We've learned that the most efficient emergency system is actually an everyday system, and that system has to reach all communities, including rural communities like Emile's.
And most of all, we've learned from the courage of Liberia's community health workers that we as people are not defined by the conditions we face, no matter how hopeless they seem.
We're defined by how we respond to them.
For the past 15 years, I've seen the power of this idea to transform everyday citizens into community health workers -- into everyday heroes.
And I've seen it play out everywhere, from the forest communities of West Africa, to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.
It's true, these community health workers aren't doing neurosurgery, but they're making it possible to bring health care within reach of everyone everywhere.
So now what? Well, we know that there are still millions of people dying from preventable causes in rural communities around the world.
And we know that the great majority of these deaths are happening in these 75 blue-shaded countries.
What we also know is that if we trained an army of community health workers to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills, we could save the lives of nearly 30 million people by 2030.
Thirty services could save 30 million lives by 2030.
That's not just a blueprint -- we're proving this can be done.
In Liberia, the Liberian government is training thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu after Ebola, to bring health care to every child and family in the country.
And we've been honored to work with them, and are now teaming up with a number of organizations that are working across other countries to try to help them do the same thing.
If we could help these countries scale, we could save millions of lives, and at the same time, we could create millions of jobs.
We simply can't do that, though, without technology.
People are worried that technology is going to steal our jobs, but when it comes to community health workers, technology has actually been vital for creating jobs.
Without technology -- without this smartphone, without this rapid test -- it would have been impossible for us to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.
And I think it's time for technology to help us train, to help us train people faster and better than ever before.
As a doctor, I use technology to stay up-to-date and keep certified.
I use smartphones, I use apps, I use online courses.
But when A.B. wants to learn, he's got to jump back in that canoe and get to the training center.
And when Musu shows up for training, her instructors are stuck using flip charts and markers.
Why shouldn't they have the same access to learn as I do?
If we truly want community health workers to master those lifesaving skills and even more, we've got to change this old-school model of education.
Tech can truly be a game changer here.
I've been in awe of the digital education revolution that the likes of Khan Academy and edX have been leading.
And I've been thinking that it's time; it's time for a collision between the digital education revolution and the community health revolution.
And so, this brings me to my TED Prize wish.
I wish -- I wish that you would help us recruit the largest army of community health workers the world has ever known by creating the Community Health Academy, a global platform to train, connect and empower.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Here's the idea: we'll create and curate the best in digital education resources.
We will bring those to community health workers around the world, including A.B. and Musu.
They'll get video lessons on giving kids vaccines and have online courses on spotting the next outbreak, so they're not stuck using flip charts.
We'll help these countries accredit these workers, so that they're not stuck remaining an under-recognized, undervalued group, but become a renowned, empowered profession, just like nurses and doctors.
And we'll create a network of companies and entrepreneurs who've created innovations that can save lives and help them connect to workers like Musu, so she can help better serve her community.
And we'll work tirelessly to persuade governments to make community health workers a cornerstone of their health care plans.
We plan to test and prototype the academy in Liberia and a few other partner countries, and then we plan to take it global, including to rural North America.
With the power of this platform, we believe countries can be more persuaded that a health care revolution really is possible.
from the forest communities of West Africa, My dream is that this academy will contribute to the training of hundreds of thousands of community members to help bring health care to their neighbors -- the hundreds of millions of them that live in the world's most remote communities, to the fishing villages of rural Alaska; from the hilltops of Appalachia, to the mountains of Afghanistan.
If this vision is aligned with yours, head to communityhealthacademy.org, and join this revolution.
Let us know if you or your organization or someone you know could help us as we try to build this academy over the next year.
Now, as I look out into this room, I realize that our journeys are not self-made; they're shaped by others.
And there have been so many here that have been part of this cause.
We're so honored to be part of this community, and a community that's willing to take on a cause as audacious as this one, so I wanted to offer, as I end, a reflection.
I think a lot more about what my father taught me.
These days, I too have become a dad.
I have two sons, and my wife and I just learned that she's pregnant with our third child.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I was recently caring for a woman in Liberia who, like my wife, was in her third pregnancy.
But unlike my wife, had had no prenatal care with her first two babies.
She lived in an isolated community in the forest that had gone for 100 years without any health care until... until last year when a nurse trained her neighbors to become community health workers.
So here I was, seeing this patient who was in her second trimester, and I pulled out the ultrasound to check on the baby, and she started telling us stories about her first two kids, and I had the ultrasound probe on her belly, and she just stopped mid-sentence.
She turned to me and she said, "Doc, what's that sound?" It was the first time she'd ever heard her baby's heartbeat.
And her eyes lit up in the same way my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up when we heard our baby's heartbeat.
For all of human history, illness has been universal and access to care has not.
no condition is permanent. But as a wise man once told me: It's time. It's time for us to go as far as it takes to change this condition together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Silicon Valley is obsessed with disruption, but these days, the biggest disruptor didn't come out of Silicon Valley.
It came out of steel towns in Ohio, rural communities in Pennsylvania, the Panhandle in Florida.
And this last US presidential election was the mother of all disruptions.
Once again, politics is personal.
Millions of Americans became activists overnight, pouring into the streets in record numbers in record time.
(Laughter)
The election has done to family holiday dinners what Uber has done to New York City's taxi system.
Couples have broken up and marriages disrupted.
And the election is doing to my private life what Amazon is doing to shopping malls.
These days, the ACLU is on the front lines 24 / 7, and even if I manage to sneak away for a couple of miles on the treadmill, any cardio benefit I get is instantly obliterated when I read another presidential tweet on the headline scroll.
Even my secret pleasure of studying the Italian painters have been infected by politics.
Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters.
This is my desk, with a postcard exhibition of some famous and obscure paintings mostly from the Italian Renaissance.
Now, art used to provide me with a necessary break from the hurly-burly of politics in my daily work at the ACLU, but not anymore.
I was at the Women's March in San Francisco the day after inauguration, and the crowd was chanting, "This is what democracy looks like." "This is what democracy looks like." And there I was holding my sign and my umbrella in the rain, and I flashed on an old painting that first captivated me many years ago.
I struggled to remember the different pieces of an actual painting of good and bad government.
It was almost like the old master was taunting me.
You want to know what democracy looks like?
Go back and look at my frescoes.
And so I did. In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti finished a monumental commission in the governing council chamber of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.
It's a painting that speaks to us, even screams to us, today. "Art is a lie that makes us realize truth," Pablo Picasso once said.
And as we search for the truth about government, we should keep Ambrogio's work, not a lie but an allegory, in our collective mind's eye.
During Lorenzetti's time, the political legitimacy of Italian city-states was often on very shaky ground.
Siena was a republic, but there had been enormous unrest in the two decades leading up to the commission.
Siena's political leaders, who would literally govern under the eyes of these allegorical figures, were Lorenzetti's intended audience.
He was cataloging the obligations of the governing to the governed.
Now, you can spend years studying these frescoes. Some scholars have. I'm hardly an art historian, but I am passionate about art, and a work this massive can overwhelm me.
So first, I focus on the big stuff.
This is the allegory of good government.
The majestic figure here in the middle is dressed in Siena's colors and he personifies the republic itself.
Lorenzetti labels him "Commune," and he's basically telling the Sienese that they, and not a king or a tyrant, must rule themselves.
Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors. Justice is enthroned. She's looking up at the figure of wisdom, who actually supports her scales of justice.
Concord, or Harmony, holds a string that comes off the scales of justice that binds her to the citizens, making them all compatriots in the republic.
And finally we see Peace.
She looks chilled out, like she's listening to Bob Marley.
When good government rules, Peace doesn't break a sweat.
Now, these are big images and big ideas, but I really love the small stuff.
Along another wall, Lorenzetti illustrates the effects of good government on the real and everyday lives of ordinary people with a series of delicious little details.
In the countryside, the hills are landscaped and farmed.
Crops are being sown, hoed, reaped, milled, plowed, all in one picture.
Crops and livestock are being brought to market.
In the city, builders raise a tower.
People attend a law lecture, a TED Talk of the 14th century.
(Laughter)
Schoolchildren play. Tradesmen thrive. Dancers larger than life dance with joy.
And watching over the republic is the winged figure Security, whose banner reads, "Everyone shall go forth freely without fear."
Now, what's amazing about these images from 800 years ago is that they're familiar to us today.
We see what democracy looks like.
We experience the effects of good government in our lives, just as Lorenzetti did in his life.
But it is the allegory of bad government that has been haunting me since November 9.
It's badly damaged, but it reads like today's newspapers.
And ruling over bad government is not the Commune but the Tyrant.
He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes, braided hair.
He obviously spends a lot of time on that hair.
(Laughter)
Justice now lies helpless at his feet, shackled.
Her scales have been severed.
Justice is the key antagonist to the Tyrant, and she's been taken out.
Now, surrounding the Tyrant, Lorenzetti illustrates the vices that animate bad government.
Avarice is the old woman clutching the strongbox and a fisherman's hook to pull in her fortune.
Vainglory carries a mirror, and Lorenzetti warns us against narcissistic leaders who are guided by their own ego and vanity.
On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty.
Treason, half lamb, half scorpion, lulls us into a false sense of security and then poisons a republic.
Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.
On the Tyrant's left, you see Division.
She's dressed in Siena's colors. "Si" and "No" are painted on her body.
She uses a carpenter's saw to chop her body in half.
And Fury wields the weapons of the mob, the stone and knife.
In the remainder of the fresco, Lorenzetti shows us the inevitable effects of bad government.
The civic ideals celebrated elsewhere in this room have failed us, and we see it.
The once beautiful city has fallen to pieces, the countryside barren, the farms abandoned.
Many are in flames.
And in the sky above is not the winged figure Security, but that of Fear, whose banner reads: "None shall pass along this road without fear of death."
Now, the final image, the most important one, really, is one that Lorenzetti did not paint.
It is of the viewer.
Today, the audience for Lorenzetti's frescoes is not the governing but the governed, the individual who stands in front of his allegories and walks away with insight, who heeds a call to action.
Lorenzetti warns us that we must recognize the shadows of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny when they float across our political landscape, especially when those shadows are cast by political leaders loudly claiming to be the voice of good government and promising to make America great again.
And we must act. Democracy must not be a spectator sport.
The right to protest, the right to assemble freely, the right to petition one's government, these are not just rights.
In the face of Avarice, Fraud and Division, these are obligations. We have to disrupt --
(Applause)
We have to disrupt our lives so that we can disrupt the amoral accretion of power by those who would betray our values.
We and we the people must raise justice up and must bring peace to our nation and must come together in concord, and we have a choice.
We could either paint ourselves into the worst nightmare of Lorenzetti's bad government, or we can stay in the streets, disruptive, messy, loud.
That is what democracy looks like.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: First of all, wow. Obviously, many people passionately -- you spoke to many people passionately here.
I'm sure there are other people here who'd say, look, Trump was elected by 63 million people.
He's far from perfect, but he's trying to do what he was elected to do. Shouldn't you give him a chance?
Anthony Romero: I think we have to recognize the legitimacy of him as president versus the legitimacy of his policies.
And when so many of the policies are contrary to fundamental values, that we're all equal under the law, that we're not judged by the color of our skin or the religion we worship, we have to contest those values even as we recognize and honor the fact that our democracy rendered us a president who is championing those values.
CA: And the ACLU isn't just this force on the left, right?
You're making other arguments as well.
AR: Well, you know, very often we piss everyone off at one point.
That's what we do.
And we recently were taking stands for why Ann Coulter needs to be able to speak at Berkeley, and why Milo has free speech rights.
And we even wrote a blog that almost burnt the house down among some of our members, unfortunately, when we talked about the fact that even Donald Trump has free speech rights as president, and an effort to hold him accountable for incitement of violence at his marches or his rallies is unconstitutional and un-American.
And when you put that statement out there to a very frothy base that always is very excited for you to fight Donald Trump, and then you have a new one saying, "Wait, these rights are for everybody, even the president that we don't like." And that's our job.
(Applause)
CA: Anthony, you spoke to so many of us so powerfully.
Thank you so much. Thank you.
(Applause)
Zika fever: our newest dread disease. What is it? Where'd it come from?
What do we do about it?
Well for most adults, it's a relatively mild disease -- a little fever, a little headache, joint pain, maybe a rash.
In fact, most people who get it don't even know they've had it.
But the more we find out about the Zika virus the more terrifying it becomes.
For example, doctors have noticed an uptick of something called Guillain-Barré syndrome in recent outbreaks.
In Guillain-Barré, your immune system attacks your nerve cells it can partially or even totally paralyze you.
Fortunately, that's quite rare, and most people recover.
But if you're pregnant when you're infected you're at risk of something terrible.
Indeed, a child with a deformed head.
Here's a normal baby.
Here's that infant with what's called microcephaly. a brain in a head that's too small.
And there's no known cure.
It was actually doctors in northeastern Brazil who first noticed, just a year ago, after a Zika outbreak, that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly.
It took medical doctors another year to be sure that it was caused by the Zika virus, but they're now sure.
And if you're a "bring on the evidence" type, check out this publication.
So where did it come from, and how did it get here?
And it is here.
Like many of our viruses, it came out of Africa, specifically the Zika forest in Uganda.
Researchers at the nearby Yellow Fever Research Institute identified an unknown virus in a monkey in the Zika forest which is how it got its name.
The first human cases of Zika fever surfaced a few years later in Uganda-Tanzania.
The virus then spread through West Africa and east through equatorial Asia -- Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia.
But it was still mostly in monkeys and, of course, mosquitoes.
In fact in the 60 years between the time it was first identified in 1947 and 2007 there were only 13 reported cases of human Zika fever.
And then something extraordinary happened on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands.
There was an outbreak that affected fully 75 percent of the population.
How did it get there? By air. Today we have two billion commercial airline passengers.
An infected passenger can board a plane, fly halfway around the world before developing symptoms -- if they develop symptoms at all.
Then when they land, the local mosquitoes begin to bite them and spread the fever.
Zika fever then next surfaced in 2013 in French Polynesia.
By December of that year, it was being transmitted locally by the mosquitoes.
That led to an explosive outbreak in which almost 30,000 people were affected.
From there it radiated around the Pacific.
There were outbreaks in the Cook Islands, in New Caledonia, in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands and almost all the way around to the coast of South America and Easter Island.
And then, in early 2015, there was an upsurge of cases of a dengue-like syndrome in the city of Natal in northeastern Brazil.
The virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika, and it spread rapidly -- Recife down the coast, a big metropolitan center, soon became the epicenter.
Well people have speculated that it was 2014 World Cup soccer fans that brought the virus into the country.
But others have speculated that perhaps it was Pacific Islanders participating in championship canoe races that were held in Rio that year that brought it in.
Well today, this is only a year later. The virus is being locally transmitted by mosquitoes virtually throughout South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean Islands Until this year, the many thousands of cases that have been diagnosed in the US were contracted elsewhere.
But as of this summer, it's being transmitted locally in Miami. It's here.
So what do we do about it?
Well, preventing infection is either about protecting people or about eliminating the mosquitoes.
Let's focus on people first.
You can get vaccinated.
You can not travel to Zika areas.
Or you can cover up and apply insect repellent.
Getting vaccinated is not an option, because there isn't a vaccine yet and there probably won't be for a couple of years.
Staying home isn't a foolproof protection either because we now know that it can be sexually transmitted.
Covering up and applying insect repellent does work ...
until you forget.
(Laughter) So that leaves the mosquitoes, and here's how we control them now: spraying insecticides.
The protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals that kill people as well as bugs.
Although it does take quite a lot more to kill a person than to kill a bug.
These are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua.
But it looks the same in Miami, Florida.
And we of course can spray insecticides from planes.
Last summer, mosquito control officials in Dorchester County, South Carolina, authorized spraying of Naled, an insecticide, early one morning, as recommended by the manufacturer.
Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters that her bee yard looked like it had been nuked. Oops. Bees are the good guys.
The citizens of Florida protested, but spraying continued.
Unfortunately, so did the increase in the number of Zika fever cases.
That's because insecticides aren't very effective.
So are there any approaches that are perhaps more effective than spraying but with less downsides than toxic chemicals?
I'm a huge fan of biological controls, and I share that view with Rachel Carson, author of "Silent Spring," the book that is credited with starting the environmental movement.
In this book she tells the story, as an example, of how a very nasty insect pest of livestock was eliminated in the last century.
No one knows that extraordinary story today.
So Jack Block and I, when we were writing an editorial about the mosquito problem today, retold that story.
And in capsule form, it's that pupae -- that's the immature form of the insect -- were irradiated until they were sterile, grown to adulthood and then released from planes all over the Southwest, the Southeast and down into Mexico and into Central America literally by the hundreds of millions from little airplanes, eventually eliminating that terrible insect pest for most of the Western Hemisphere.
Our real purpose in writing this editorial was to introduce readers to how we can do that today -- not with radiation but with our knowledge of genetics. Let me explain.
This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti. It's the most common insect vector of diseases, not just Zika but dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile virus and that ancient plague, yellow fever.
It's an urban mosquito, and it's the female that does the dirty work.
She bites to get a blood meal to feed her offspring.
Males don't bite; they don't even have the mouth parts to bite.
A little British company called Oxitec genetically modified that mosquito so that when it mates with a wild female, its eggs don't develop to adulthood.
Let me show you.
This is the normal reproductive cycle.
Oxitec designed the mosquito so that when the male mates with the wild female the eggs don't develop. Sounds impossible? Well let me show you just diagrammatically how they do it.
Now this represents the nucleus of a mosquito cell, and that tangle in the middle represents its genome, the sum total of its genes.
Scientists added a single gene that codes for a protein represented by this orange ball that feeds back on itself to keep cranking out more of that protein.
The extra copies, however, go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes, killing the organism.
To keep it alive in the laboratory they use a compound called tetracycline.
Tetracycline shuts off that gene and allows normal development.
They added another little wrinkle so that they could study what happens.
And that is they added a gene that makes the insect glow under UV light so that when they released it they could follow exactly how far it went how long it lived and all of the kinds of data for a good scientific study.
Now this is the pupal stage, and at this stage the females are larger than the males.
That allows them to sort them into the males and the females and they allow only the males to grow to adulthood.
And let me remind you that males don't bite.
From there it's pretty simple.
They take beakers full of male mosquitoes, load them into milk cartons, and drive around the city, releasing them guided by GPS.
Here's the mayor of a city releasing the first batch of what they call the "friendly Aedes." Now I wish I could tell you this is an American city, but it's not.
It's Piracicaba, Brazil.
The amazing thing is that in just a year it brought down the cases of dengue by 91 percent.
That's better than any insecticide spraying can do.
So why aren't we using this remarkable biological control in the US?
That's because it's a GMO: a genetically modified organism.
Notice the subtitle here says if the FDA would let them they could do the same thing here, when Zika arrives.
And of course it has arrived.
So now I have to tell you the short form of the long, torturous story of GM regulation in the US In the US, there are three agencies that regulate genetically modified organisms: the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the USDA, US Department of Agriculture.
Took these folks two years to decide that it would be the FDA that would regulate the genetically modified mosquito.
And they would do it as a new animal drug, if that makes any sense.
Took them another five years going back and forth and back and forth to convince the FDA that this would not harm people, and it would not harm the environment.
They finally gave them, this summer, permission to run a little test in the Florida Keys, where they had been invited years earlier when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue.
Would that it were that easy.
When the local residents heard that there would be genetically modified mosquitoes tested in their community some of them began to organize protests.
They even organized a petition on the internet with this cuddly logo, which eventually accumulated some 160,000 signatures And they demanded a referendum which will be conducted in just a couple of weeks about whether the trials would be permitted at all.
Well it's Miami that really needs these better ways of controlling insects.
And there the attitudes are changing.
In fact, very recently a bipartisan group of more than 60 legislators wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell asking that she, at the Federal level, expedite access for Florida to this new technology.
So the bottom line is this: biological control of harmful insects can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly than using insecticides, which are toxic chemicals.
That was true in Rachel Carson's time; it's true today.
What's different is that we have enormously more information about genetics than we had then, and therefore more ability to use that information to affect these biological controls.
And I hope that what I've done is aroused your curiosity enough to start your own inquiry -- not into just GM mosquitoes but to the other genetically modified organisms that are so controversial today.
I think if you do that, and you dig down through all of the misinformation, and the marketing on the part of the organic food industry and the Greenpeaces and find the science, the accurate science, you'll be surprised and pleased.
Thank you.
(Applause)
She wrote: "When I become famous, I will tell everyone that I know a hero named Marlon Peterson."
Heroes rarely look like me.
In fact, I'm what garbage looks like.
No, not the most appealing way to open a talk or start a conversation, and perhaps you have some questions going through your head about that.
Why would this man say such a thing about himself? What does he mean? How can someone view him as a hero when he sees himself as garbage?
I believe we learn more from questions than we do from answers.
Because when we're questioning something, we're invested in taking in some sort of new information, or grappling with some sort of ignorance that makes us feel uncomfortable.
And that's why I'm here: to push us to question, even when it makes us uncomfortable.
My parents are from Trinidad and Tobago, the southernmost island in the Caribbean.
Trinidad is also home to the only acoustic instrument invented in the 20th century: the steel pan.
Deriving from the African drums and evolving from the genius of one of the ghettos in Trinidad, a city called Laventille, and the disregard of the American military ... Well, I should tell you, America, during WWII, had military bases set up in Trinidad, and when the war ended, they left the island littered with empty oil drums -- their trash.
the steel pan. So people from Laventille repurposed the old drums left behind into the full chromatic scale:
Playing music now from Beethoven to Bob Marley to 50 Cent, those people literally made music out of garbage.
Twelve days before my 20th birthday, I was arrested for my role in a violent robbery attempt in lower Manhattan.
While people were sitting in a coffee shop, four people were shot. Two were killed. Five of us were arrested.
We were all the products of Trinidad and Tobago.
We were the "bad immigrants," or the "anchor babies" that Trump and millions of Americans easily malign.
I was discarded, like waste material -- and justifiably so to many.
I eventually served 10 years, two months and seven days of a prison sentence.
I was sentenced to a decade of punishment in a correctional institution.
I was sentenced to irrelevance -- the opposite of humanity.
Interestingly, it was during those years in prison that a series of letters redeemed me, helped me move beyond the darkness and the guilt associated with the worst moment of my young life.
It gave me a sense that I was useful.
She was 13 years old.
She had wrote that she saw me as a hero.
I remember reading that, and I remember crying when I read those words.
She was one of over 50 students and 150 letters that I wrote during a mentoring correspondence program that I co-designed with a friend who was a teacher at a middle school in Brooklyn, my hometown.
We called it the Young Scholars Program.
Every time those young people shared their stories with me, their struggles, every time they drew a picture of their favorite cartoon character and sent it to me, every time they said they depended on my letters or my words of advice, it boosted my sense of worthiness.
It gave me a sense of what I could contribute to this planet.
It transformed my life.
Because of those letters and what they shared with me, their stories of teen life, they gave me the permission, they gave me the courage to admit to myself that there were reasons -- not excuses -- but that there were reasons for that fateful day in October of 1999; that the trauma associated with living in a community where guns are easier to get than sneakers; that the trauma associated with being raped at gunpoint at the age of 14; that those are reasons for me why making that decision, that fatal decision, was not an unlikely proposition.
Because those letters mattered so much to me, because writing and receiving and having that communication with those folks so hugely impacted my life, I decided to share the opportunity with some friends of mine who were also inside with me.
My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks, all in prison for violent crimes also, shared their words of wisdom with the young people as well, and received the sense of relevancy in return.
We are now published writers and youth program innovators and trauma experts and gun violence prevention advocates, and TED talkers and --
(Laughter)
and good daddies. That's what I call a positive return of investment.
Above all else, what building that program taught me was that when we sow, when we invest in the humanity of people no matter where they're at, we can reap amazing rewards.
In this latest era of criminal justice reform, I often question and wonder why -- why is it that so many believe that only those who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses merit empathy and recognized humanity?
Criminal justice reform is human justice.
Am I not human?
When we invest in resources that amplify the relevancy of people in communities like Laventille or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you, we can literally create the communities that we want.
We can do better. We can do better than investing solely in law enforcement as a resource, because they don't give us a sense of relevancy that is at the core of why so many of us do so many harmful things in the pursuit of mattering.
See, gun violence is just a visible display of a lot of underlying traumas.
When we invest in the redemptive value of relevancy, we can render a return of both personal responsibility and healing.
That's the people work I care about, because people work.
Family, I'm asking you to do the hard work, the difficult work, the churning work of bestowing undeserved kindness upon those who we can relegate as garbage, who we can disregard and discard easily. I'm asking myself.
Over the past two months, I've lost two friends to gun violence, both innocent bystanders.
One was caught in a drive-by while walking home.
The other was sitting in a café while eating breakfast, while on vacation in Miami.
I'm asking myself to see the redemptive value of relevancy in the people that murdered them, because of the hard work of seeing the value in me.
I'm pushing us to challenge our own capacity to fully experience our humanity, by understanding the full biography of people who we can easily choose not to see, because heroes are waiting to be recognized, and music is waiting to be made.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, imagine that you had your smartphone miniaturized and hooked up directly to your brain.
If you had this sort of brain chip, you'd be able to upload and download to the internet at the speed of thought.
Accessing social media or Wikipedia would be a lot like -- well, from the inside at least -- like consulting your own memory.
It would be as easy and as intimate as thinking.
But would it make it easier for you to know what's true?
Just because a way of accessing information is faster it doesn't mean it's more reliable, of course, and it doesn't mean that we would all interpret it the same way.
And it doesn't mean that you would be any better at evaluating it.
In fact, you might even be worse, because, you know, more data, less time for evaluation.
Something like this is already happening to us right now.
We already carry a world of information around in our pockets, but it seems as if the more information we share and access online, the more difficult it can be for us to tell the difference between what's real and what's fake.
It's as if we know more but understand less.
Now, it's a feature of modern life, I suppose, that large swaths of the public live in isolated information bubbles.
We're polarized: not just over values, but over the facts.
One reason for that is, the data analytics that drive the internet get us not just more information, but more of the information that we want.
Our online life is personalized; everything from the ads we read to the news that comes down our Facebook feed is tailored to satisfy our preferences.
And so while we get more information, a lot of that information ends up reflecting ourselves as much as it does reality.
It ends up, I suppose, inflating our bubbles rather than bursting them.
And so maybe it's no surprise that we're in a situation, a paradoxical situation, of thinking that we know so much more, and yet not agreeing on what it is we know.
So how are we going to solve this problem of knowledge polarization?
One obvious tactic is to try to fix our technology, to redesign our digital platforms, so as to make them less susceptible to polarization.
And I'm happy to report that many smart people at Google and Facebook are working on just that.
And these projects are vital.
I think that fixing technology is obviously really important, but I don't think technology alone, fixing it, is going to solve the problem of knowledge polarization.
I don't think that because I don't think, at the end of the day, it is a technological problem.
I think it's a human problem, having to do with how we think and what we value.
In order to solve it, I think we're going to need help.
We're going to need help from psychology and political science.
But we're also going to need help, I think, from philosophy.
Because to solve the problem of knowledge polarization, we're going to need to reconnect with one fundamental, philosophical idea: that we live in a common reality.
The idea of a common reality is like, I suppose, a lot of philosophical concepts: easy to state but mysteriously difficult to put into practice.
To really accept it, I think we need to do three things, each of which is a challenge right now.
First, we need to believe in truth.
You might have noticed that our culture is having something of a troubled relationship with that concept right now.
It seems as if we disagree so much that, as one political commentator put it not long ago, it's as if there are no facts anymore.
But that thought is actually an expression of a sort of seductive line of argument that's in the air.
It goes like this: we just can't step outside of our own perspectives; we can't step outside of our biases.
Every time we try, we just get more information from our perspective.
So, this line of thought goes, we might as well admit that objective truth is an illusion, or it doesn't matter, because either we'll never know what it is, or it doesn't exist in the first place.
That's not a new philosophical thought -- skepticism about truth.
During the end of the last century, as some of you know, it was very popular in certain academic circles.
But it really goes back all the way to the Greek philosopher Protagoras, if not farther back.
Protagoras said that objective truth was an illusion because "man is the measure of all things." Man is the measure of all things.
That can seem like a bracing bit of realpolitik to people, or liberating, because it allows each of us to discover or make our own truth.
But actually, I think it's a bit of self-serving rationalization disguised as philosophy.
It confuses the difficulty of being certain with the impossibility of truth.
Look -- of course it's difficult to be certain about anything; we might all be living in "The Matrix." You might have a brain chip in your head feeding you all the wrong information.
But in practice, we do agree on all sorts of facts.
We agree that bullets can kill people.
We agree that you can't flap your arms and fly.
We agree -- or we should -- that there is an external reality and ignoring it can get you hurt.
Nonetheless, skepticism about truth can be tempting, because it allows us to rationalize away our own biases.
When we do that, we're sort of like the guy in the movie who knew he was living in "The Matrix" but decided he liked it there, anyway.
After all, getting what you want feels good.
Being right all the time feels good.
So, often it's easier for us to wrap ourselves in our cozy information bubbles, live in bad faith, and take those bubbles as the measure of reality.
An example, I think, of how this bad faith gets into our action is our reaction to the phenomenon of fake news.
The fake news that spread on the internet during the American presidential election of 2016 was designed to feed into our biases, designed to inflate our bubbles.
But what was really striking about it was not just that it fooled so many people.
What was really striking to me about fake news, the phenomenon, is how quickly it itself became the subject of knowledge polarization; so much so, that the very term — the very term — "fake news" now just means: "news story I don't like." That's an example of the bad faith towards the truth that I'm talking about.
Man is the measure of all things. But the really, I think, dangerous thing about skepticism with regard to truth is that it leads to despotism. inevitably becomes "The Man is the measure of all things." Just as "every man for himself" always seems to turn out to be "only the strong survive."
At the end of Orwell's "1984," the thought policeman O'Brien is torturing the protagonist Winston Smith into believing two plus two equals five.
What O'Brien says is the point, is that he wants to convince Smith that whatever the party says is the truth, and the truth is whatever the party says.
And what O'Brien knows is that once this thought is accepted, critical dissent is impossible.
You can't speak truth to power if the power speaks truth by definition.
I said that in order to accept that we really live in a common reality, we have to do three things.
The first thing is to believe in truth.
The second thing can be summed up by the Latin phrase that Kant took as the motto for the Enlightenment: "Sapere aude," or "dare to know." Or as Kant wants, "to dare to know for yourself."
I think in the early days of the internet, a lot of us thought that information technology was always going to make it easier for us to know for ourselves, and of course in many ways, it has.
But as the internet has become more and more a part of our lives, our reliance on it, our use of it, has become often more passive.
Much of what we know today we Google-know.
We download prepackaged sets of facts and sort of shuffle them along the assembly line of social media.
Now, Google-knowing is useful precisely because it involves a sort of intellectual outsourcing.
We offload our effort onto a network of others and algorithms.
And that allows us, of course, to not clutter our minds with all sorts of facts.
We can just download them when we need them. And that's awesome.
But there's a difference between downloading a set of facts and really understanding how or why those facts are as they are.
Understanding why a particular disease spreads, or how a mathematical proof works, or why your friend is depressed, involves more than just downloading.
It's going to require, most likely, doing some work for yourself: having a little creative insight; using your imagination; getting out into the field; doing the experiment; working through the proof; talking to someone.
Now, I'm not saying, of course, that we should stop Google-knowing. I'm just saying we shouldn't overvalue it, either.
We need to find ways of encouraging forms of knowing that are more active, and don't always involve passing off our effort into our bubble.
Because the thing about Google-knowing is that too often it ends up being bubble-knowing.
And bubble-knowing means always being right.
But daring to know, daring to understand, means risking the possibility that you could be wrong.
It means risking the possibility that what you want and what's true are different things.
Which brings me to the third thing that I think we need to do if we want to accept that we live in a common reality.
That third thing is: have a little humility.
By humility here, I mean epistemic humility, which means, in a sense, knowing that you don't know it all.
But it also means something more than that.
It means seeing your worldview as open to improvement by the evidence and experience of others.
by the evidence and experience of others. Seeing your worldview as open to improvement
That's more than just being open to change. It's more than just being open to self-improvement.
It means seeing your knowledge as capable of enhancing or being enriched by what others contribute.
That's part of what is involved in recognizing there's a common reality that you, too, are responsible to.
I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that our society is not particularly great at enhancing or encouraging that sort of humility.
That's partly because, well, we tend to confuse arrogance and confidence.
And it's partly because, well, you know, arrogance is just easier.
It's just easier to think of yourself as knowing it all.
It's just easier to think of yourself as having it all figured out.
But that's another example of the bad faith towards the truth that I've been talking about.
So the concept of a common reality, like a lot of philosophical concepts, can seem so obvious, that we can look right past it and forget why it's important.
Democracies can't function if their citizens don't strive, at least some of the time, to inhabit a common space, a space where they can pass ideas back and forth when -- and especially when -- they disagree.
But you can't strive to inhabit that space if you don't already accept that you live in the same reality.
To accept that, we've got to believe in truth, we've got to encourage more active ways of knowing.
And we've got to have the humility to realize that we're not the measure of all things.
We may yet one day realize the vision of having the internet in our brains.
But if we want that to be liberating and not terrifying, if we want it to expand our understanding and not just our passive knowing, we need to remember that our perspectives, as wondrous, as beautiful as they are, are just that -- perspectives on one reality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Imagine that when you walked in here this evening, you discovered that everybody in the room looked almost exactly the same: ageless, raceless, generically good-looking.
That person sitting right next to you might have the most idiosyncratic inner life, but you don't have a clue because we're all wearing the same blank expression all the time.
That is the kind of creepy transformation that is taking over cities, only it applies to buildings, not people.
Cities are full of roughness and shadow, texture and color.
You can still find architectural surfaces of great individuality and character in apartment buildings in Riga and Yemen, social housing in Vienna, Hopi villages in Arizona, brownstones in New York, wooden houses in San Francisco.
These aren't palaces or cathedrals.
These are just ordinary residences expressing the ordinary splendor of cities.
And the reason they're like that is that the need for shelter is so bound up with the human desire for beauty.
Their rough surfaces give us a touchable city. Right? Streets that you can read by running your fingers over brick and stone.
But that's getting harder to do, because cities are becoming smooth.
New downtowns sprout towers that are almost always made of concrete and steel and covered in glass.
You can look at skylines all over the world -- Houston, Guangzhou, Frankfurt -- and you see the same army of high-gloss robots marching over the horizon.
Now, just think of everything we lose when architects stop using the full range of available materials.
When we reject granite and limestone and sandstone and wood and copper and terra-cotta and brick and wattle and plaster, we simplify architecture and we impoverish cities.
It's as if you reduced all of the world's cuisines down to airline food. (Laughter) Chicken or pasta?
But worse still, assemblies of glass towers like this one in Moscow suggest a disdain for the civic and communal aspects of urban living. Right? Buildings like these are intended to enrich their owners and tenants, but not necessarily the lives of the rest of us, those of us who navigate the spaces between the buildings.
And we expect to do so for free.
Shiny towers are an invasive species and they are choking our cities and killing off public space.
We tend to think of a facade as being like makeup, a decorative layer applied at the end to a building that's effectively complete.
But just because a facade is superficial doesn't mean it's not also deep.
Let me give you an example of how a city's surfaces affect the way we live in it.
When I visited Salamanca in Spain, I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor at all hours of the day.
Early in the morning, sunlight rakes the facades, sharpening shadows, and at night, lamplight segments the buildings into hundreds of distinct areas, balconies and windows and arcades, each one a separate pocket of visual activity.
That detail and depth, that glamour gives the plaza a theatrical quality.
It becomes a stage where the generations can meet.
You have teenagers sprawling on the pavers, seniors monopolizing the benches, and real life starts to look like an opera set.
The curtain goes up on Salamanca.
So just because I'm talking about the exteriors of buildings, not form, not function, not structure, even so those surfaces give texture to our lives, because buildings create the spaces around them, and those spaces can draw people in or push them away.
And the difference often has to do with the quality of those exteriors.
So one contemporary equivalent of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca is the Place de la Défense in Paris, a windswept, glass-walled open space that office workers hurry through on the way from the metro to their cubicles but otherwise spend as little time in as possible.
In the early 1980s, the architect Philip Johnson tried to recreate a gracious European plaza in Pittsburgh.
This is PPG Place, a half acre of open space encircled by commercial buildings made of mirrored glass.
And he ornamented those buildings with metal trim and bays and Gothic turrets which really pop on the skyline.
But at ground level, the plaza feels like a black glass cage.
I mean, sure, in summertime kids are running back and forth through the fountain and there's ice-skating in the winter, but it lacks the informality of a leisurely hangout.
It's just not the sort of place you really want to just hang out and chat.
Public spaces thrive or fail for many different reasons.
Architecture is only one, but it's an important one.
Some recent plazas like Federation Square in Melbourne or Superkilen in Copenhagen succeed because they combine old and new, rough and smooth, neutral and bright colors, and because they don't rely excessively on glass.
Now, I'm not against glass.
It's an ancient and versatile material.
It's easy to manufacture and transport and install and replace and clean.
It comes in everything from enormous, ultraclear sheets to translucent bricks.
New coatings make it change mood in the shifting light.
In expensive cities like New York, it has the magical power of being able to multiply real estate values by allowing views, which is really the only commodity that developers have to offer to justify those surreal prices.
In the middle of the 19th century, with the construction of the Crystal Palace in London, glass leapt to the top of the list of quintessentially modern substances.
By the mid-20th century, it had come to dominate the downtowns of some American cities, largely through some really spectacular office buildings like Lever House in midtown Manhattan, designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
Eventually, the technology advanced to the point where architects could design structures so transparent they practically disappear.
And along the way, glass became the default material of the high-rise city, and there's a very powerful reason for that.
Because as the world's populations converge on cities, the least fortunate pack into jerry-built shantytowns.
But hundreds of millions of people need apartments and places to work in ever-larger buildings, so it makes economic sense to put up towers and wrap them in cheap and practical curtain walls.
But glass has a limited ability to be expressive.
This is a section of wall framing a plaza in the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla, in southern Mexico.
Those 2,000-year-old carvings make it clear that this was a place of high ritual significance.
Today we look at those and we can see a historical and textural continuity between those carvings, the mountains all around and that church which is built on top of the ruins using stone plundered from the site.
In nearby Oaxaca, even ordinary plaster buildings become canvasses for bright colors, political murals and sophisticated graphic arts.
It's an intricate, communicative language that an epidemic of glass would simply wipe out.
The good news is that architects and developers have begun to rediscover the joys of texture without backing away from modernity.
Some find innovative uses for old materials like brick and terra-cotta.
Others invent new products like the molded panels that Snøhetta used to give the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that crinkly, sculptural quality.
The architect Stefano Boeri even created living facades.
This is his Vertical Forest, a pair of apartment towers in Milan, whose most visible feature is greenery.
And Boeri is designing a version of this for Nanjing in China.
And imagine if green facades were as ubiquitous as glass ones how much cleaner the air in Chinese cities would become.
But the truth is that these are mostly one-offs, boutique projects, not easily reproduced at a global scale.
And that is the point. When you use materials that have a local significance, you prevent cities from all looking the same.
Copper has a long history in New York — the Statue of Liberty, the crown of the Woolworth Building — but it fell out of fashion for a long time until SHoP Architects used it to cover the American Copper Building, a pair of twisting towers on the East River.
It's not even finished and you can see the way sunset lights up that metallic facade, which will weather to green as it ages.
Buildings can be like people.
Their faces broadcast their experience.
And that's an important point, because when glass ages, you just replace it, and the building looks pretty much the same way it did before until eventually it's demolished.
Almost all other materials have the ability to absorb infusions of history and memory, and project it into the present.
The firm Ennead clad the Utah Natural History Museum in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc, ores that have been mined in the area for 150 years and that also camouflage the building against the ochre hills so that you have a natural history museum that reflects the region's natural history.
And when the Chinese Pritzker Prize winner Wang Shu was building a history museum in Ningbo, he didn't just create a wrapper for the past, he built memory right into the walls by using brick and stones and shingles salvaged from villages that had been demolished.
Now, architects can use glass in equally lyrical and inventive ways.
Here in New York, two buildings, one by Jean Nouvel and this one by Frank Gehry face off across West 19th Street, and the play of reflections that they toss back and forth is like a symphony in light.
But when a city defaults to glass as it grows, it becomes a hall of mirrors, disquieting and cold.
After all, cities are places of concentrated variety where the world's cultures and languages and lifestyles come together and mingle.
So rather than encase all that variety and diversity in buildings of crushing sameness, we should have an architecture that honors the full range of the urban experience.
Thank you. (Applause)
Paying close attention to something: Not that easy, is it?
It's because our attention is pulled in so many different directions at a time, and it's in fact pretty impressive if you can stay focused.
Many people think that attention is all about what we are focusing on, but it's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out.
There are two ways you direct your attention.
First, there's overt attention.
In overt attention, you move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it.
Then there's covert attention.
In covert attention, you pay attention to something, but without moving your eyes.
Think of driving for a second.
Your overt attention, your direction of the eyes, are in front, but that's your covert attention which is constantly scanning the surrounding area, where you don't actually look at them.
I'm a computational neuroscientist, and I work on cognitive brain-machine interfaces, or bringing together the brain and the computer.
I love brain patterns.
Brain patterns are important for us because based on them we can build models for the computers, and based on these models computers can recognize how well our brain functions.
And if it doesn't function well, then these computers themselves can be used as assistive devices for therapies.
But that also means something, because choosing the wrong patterns will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies. Right? In case of attention, the fact that we can shift our attention not only by our eyes but also by thinking -- that makes covert attention an interesting model for computers.
So I wanted to know what are the brainwave patterns when you look overtly or when you look covertly.
I set up an experiment for that.
In this experiment there are two flickering squares, one of them flickering at a slower rate than the other one.
Depending on which of these flickers you are paying attention to, certain parts of your brain will start resonating in the same rate as that flickering rate.
So by analyzing your brain signals, we can track where exactly you are watching or you are paying attention to.
So to see what happens in your brain when you pay overt attention, I asked people to look directly in one of the squares and pay attention to it.
In this case, not surprisingly, we saw that these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming from the back of their head, which is responsible for the processing of your visual information.
But I was really interested to see what happens in your brain when you pay covert attention.
So this time I asked people to look in the middle of the screen and without moving their eyes, to pay attention to either of these squares.
When we did that, we saw that both of these flickering rates appeared in their brain signals, but interestingly, only one of them, which was paid attention to, had stronger signals, so there was something in the brain which was handling this information so that thing in the brain was basically the activation of the frontal area.
The front part of your brain is responsible for higher cognitive functions as a human.
The frontal part, it seems that it works as a filter trying to let information come in only from the right flicker that you are paying attention to and trying to inhibit the information coming from the ignored one.
The filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key for attention, which is missing in some people, for example in people with ADHD.
So a person with ADHD cannot inhibit these distractors, and that's why they can't focus for a long time on a single task.
But what if this person could play a specific computer game with his brain connected to the computer, and then train his own brain to inhibit these distractors?
Well, ADHD is just one example.
We can use these cognitive brain-machine interfaces for many other cognitive fields.
It was just a few years ago that my grandfather had a stroke, and he lost complete ability to speak.
He could understand everybody, but there was no way to respond, even not writing because he was illiterate.
So he passed away in silence.
I remember thinking at that time: What if we could have a computer which could speak for him? Now, after years that I am in this field, I can see that this might be possible.
Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns when people think about images or even letters, like the letter A generates a different brainwave pattern than the letter B, and so on. Could a computer one day communicate for people who can't speak?
What if a computer can help us understand the thoughts of a person in a coma?
We are not there yet, but pay close attention.
We will be there soon.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, this happy pic of me was taken in 1999.
I was a senior in college, and it was right after a dance practice.
I was really, really happy.
And I remember exactly where I was about a week and a half later.
I was sitting in the back of my used minivan in a campus parking lot, when I decided I was going to commit suicide.
I went from deciding to full-blown planning very quickly.
And I came this close to the edge of the precipice.
It's the closest I've ever come.
And the only reason I took my finger off the trigger was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.
And after the fact, that's what scared me the most: the element of chance.
So I became very methodical about testing different ways that I could manage my ups and downs, which has proven to be a good investment. (Laughs) Many normal people might have, say, six to 10 major depressive episodes in their lives.
I have bipolar depression.
It runs in my family.
I've had 50-plus at this point, and I've learned a lot.
I've had a lot of at-bats, many rounds in the ring with darkness, taking good notes.
So I thought rather than get up and give any type of recipe for success or highlight reel, I would share my recipe for avoiding self-destruction, and certainly self-paralysis.
And the tool I've found which has proven to be the most reliable safety net for emotional free fall is actually the same tool that has helped me to make my best business decisions.
But that is secondary.
And it is ... stoicism. That sounds boring.
(Laughter)
You might think of Spock, or it might conjure and image like this --
(Laughter)
a cow standing in the rain.
It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.
It's just an impassive creature taking whatever life sends its way.
You might not think of the ultimate competitor, say, Bill Belichick, head coach of the New England Patriots, who has the all-time NFL record for Super Bowl titles.
And stoicism has spread like wildfire in the top of the NFL ranks as a means of mental toughness training in the last few years.
You might not think of the Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Washington to name but three students of stoicism.
George Washington actually had a play about a Stoic -- this was "Cato, a Tragedy" -- performed for his troops at Valley Forge to keep them motivated.
So why would people of action focus so much on an ancient philosophy?
This seems very academic.
I would encourage you to think about stoicism a little bit differently, as an operating system for thriving in high-stress environments, for making better decisions.
And it all started here, kind of, on a porch.
So around 300 BC in Athens, someone named Zeno of Citium taught many lectures walking around a painted porch, a "stoa." That later became "stoicism." And in the Greco-Roman world, people used stoicism as a comprehensive system for doing many, many things.
But for our purposes, chief among them was training yourself to separate what you can control from what you cannot control, and then doing exercises to focus exclusively on the former.
This decreases emotional reactivity, which can be a superpower.
Conversely, let's say you're a quarterback.
You miss a pass. You get furious with yourself. That could cost you a game.
If you're a CEO, and you fly off the handle at a very valued employee because of a minor infraction, that could cost you the employee.
If you're a college student who, say, is in a downward spiral, and you feel helpless and hopeless, unabated, that could cost you your life.
So the stakes are very, very high.
And there are many tools in the toolkit to get you there.
I'm going to focus on one that completely changed my life in 2004.
It found me then because of two things: a very close friend, young guy, my age, died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly, and then my girlfriend, who I thought I was going to marry, walked out.
She'd had enough, and she didn't give me a Dear John letter, but she did give me this, a Dear John plaque.
(Laughter)
I'm not making this up. I've kept it. "Business hours are over at five o'clock." She gave this to me to put on my desk for personal health, because at the time, I was working on my first real business.
I had no idea what I was doing.
I was working 14-plus hour days, seven days a week.
I was using stimulants to get going. I was using depressants to wind down and go to sleep.
It was a disaster.
I felt completely trapped.
I bought a book on simplicity to try to find answers.
And I did find a quote that made a big difference in my life, which was, "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality," by Seneca the Younger, who was a famous Stoic writer.
That took me to his letters, which took me to the exercise, "premeditatio malorum," which means the pre-meditation of evils.
In simple terms, this is visualizing the worst-case scenarios, in detail, that you fear, preventing you from taking action, so that you can take action to overcome that paralysis.
My problem was monkey mind -- super loud, very incessant.
Just thinking my way through problems doesn't work.
I needed to capture my thoughts on paper.
So I created a written exercise that I called "fear-setting," like goal-setting, for myself.
It consists of three pages. Super simple.
The first page is right here. "What if I ...?" This is whatever you fear, whatever is causing you anxiety, whatever you're putting off.
It could be asking someone out, ending a relationship, asking for a promotion, quitting a job, starting a company. It could be anything. For me, it was taking my first vacation in four years and stepping away from my business for a month to go to London, where I could stay in a friend's room for free, to either remove myself as a bottleneck in the business or shut it down.
In the first column, "Define," you're writing down all of the worst things you can imagine happening if you take that step.
You want 10 to 20.
I won't go through all of them, but I'll give you two examples.
One was, I'll go to London, it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed, the whole thing will be a huge waste of time.
Number two, I'll miss a letter from the IRS, and I'll get audited or raided or shut down or some such.
And then you go to the "Prevent" column.
In that column, you write down the answer to: What could I do to prevent each of these bullets from happening, or, at the very least, decrease the likelihood even a little bit?
So for getting depressed in London, I could take a portable blue light with me and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.
I knew that helped stave off depressive episodes.
For the IRS bit, I could change the mailing address on file with the IRS so the paperwork would go to my accountant instead of to my UPS address. Easy-peasy.
Then we go to "Repair." So if the worst-case scenarios happen, what could you do to repair the damage even a little bit, or who could you ask for help?
So in the first case, London, well, I could fork over some money, fly to Spain, get some sun -- undo the damage, if I got into a funk.
In the case of missing a letter from the IRS, I could call a friend who is a lawyer or ask, say, a professor of law what they would recommend, who I should talk to, how had people handled this in the past.
So one question to keep in mind as you're doing this first page is: Has anyone else in the history of time less intelligent or less driven figured this out?
Chances are, the answer is "Yes."
(Laughter)
The second page is simple: What might be the benefits of an attempt or a partial success?
You can see we're playing up the fears and really taking a conservative look at the upside.
So if you attempted whatever you're considering, might you build confidence, develop skills, emotionally, financially, otherwise?
What might be the benefits of, say, a base hit?
Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this.
Page three. This might be the most important, so don't skip it: "The Cost of Inaction." Humans are very good at considering what might go wrong if we try something new, say, ask for a raise.
What we don't often consider is the atrocious cost of the status quo -- not changing anything.
So you should ask yourself, if I avoid this action or decision and actions and decisions like it, what might my life look like in, say, six months, 12 months, three years?
Any further out, it starts to seem intangible.
And really get detailed -- again, emotionally, financially, physically, whatever.
And when I did this, it painted a terrifying picture.
I was self-medicating, my business was going to implode at any moment at all times, if I didn't step away.
My relationships were fraying or failing.
And I realized that inaction was no longer an option for me.
Those are the three pages. That's it. That's fear-setting. And after this, I realized that on a scale of one to 10, one being minimal impact, 10 being maximal impact, if I took the trip, I was risking a one to three of temporary and reversible pain for an eight to 10 of positive, life-changing impact that could be a semi-permanent.
So I took the trip.
None of the disasters came to pass.
There were some hiccups, sure.
I was able to extricate myself from the business.
I ended up extending that trip for a year and a half around the world, and that became the basis for my first book, that leads me here today.
And I can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fear-setting at least once a quarter.
It's not a panacea.
You'll find that some of your fears are very well-founded.
(Laughter)
But you shouldn't conclude that without first putting them under a microscope.
And it doesn't make all the hard times, the hard choices, easy, but it can make a lot of them easier.
I'd like to close with a profile of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics. This is Jerzy Gregorek. He is a four-time world champion in Olympic weightlifting, political refugee, published poet, 62 years old.
He can still kick my ass and probably most asses in this room. He's an impressive guy.
I spent a lot of time on his stoa, his porch, asking life and training advice.
He was part of the Solidarity in Poland, which was a nonviolent movement for social change that was violently suppressed by the government.
He lost his career as a firefighter.
Then his mentor, a priest, was kidnapped, tortured, killed and thrown into a river.
He was then threatened.
He and his wife had to flee Poland, bounce from country to country until they landed in the US with next to nothing, sleeping on floors.
He now lives in Woodside, California, in a very nice place, and of the 10,000-plus people I've met in my life, I would put him in the top 10, in terms of success and happiness.
And there's a punchline coming, so pay attention.
I sent him a text a few weeks ago, asking him: Had he ever read any Stoic philosophy?
And he replied with two pages of text.
This is very unlike him. He is a terse dude.
(Laughter)
And not only was he familiar with stoicism, but he pointed out, for all of his most important decisions, his inflection points, when he stood up for his principles and ethics, how he had used stoicism and something akin to fear-setting, which blew my mind.
And he closed with two things.
Number one: he couldn't imagine any life more beautiful than that of a Stoic.
And the last was his mantra, which he applies to everything, and you can apply to everything:
"Easy choices, hard life.
Hard choices, easy life."
The hard choices -- what we most fear doing, asking, saying -- these are very often exactly what we most need to do.
And the biggest challenges and problems we face will never be solved with comfortable conversations, whether it's in your own head or with other people.
So I encourage you to ask yourselves: Where in your lives right now might defining your fears be more important than defining your goals?
Keeping in mind all the while, the words of Seneca: "We suffer more often in imagination than in reality."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The best Christmas my children ever had was also the worst Christmas my husband and I ever had.
Elizabeth, age seven, and her brother, Ian, age five, couldn't imagine why they were getting everything they wanted for Christmas.
The reason Santa was so generous was because of something my husband Pat and I knew and the kids couldn't comprehend.
Something that we had just learned, and it terrified us.
This was 1994 and the story actually starts a few years earlier.
For a couple of years I had noticed a rash on the sides of Elizabeth's neck that looked like prickly heat.
For those same years, my father and brother both died of cancer, and I was probably overanxious about illness.
The doctors assured us there was nothing wrong and I shouldn't worry, but I wasn't so sure.
And so without a referral, and paying out-of-pocket, I took Elizabeth to a dermatologist.
She was probably just allergic to something, but why did it appear just on the sides of her neck, this rash?
So it's two days before Christmas, 1994, and the dermatologist takes a quick look at her neck and says, "She has pseudoxanthoma elasticum." And then he shuts off the lights and looks in her eyes.
It turns out, by chance, this dermatologist also trained in ophthalmology. Our lucky day. I am sick to my stomach. "Oma?" Oma's like melanoma, lymphoma — cancer. "Why are you looking in her eyes for a skin rash?" I scream and make no sound.
So there it is. Elizabeth has pseudoxanthoma elasticum, PXE for short. Questions mix with fear and erupt like bile in my throat.
Why are you looking in her eyes?
What do you know about this?
How do you know for sure?
What is the prognosis?
My training in pastoral counseling did not prepare me for this.
Dr. Bercovitch tells us everything he knows about PXE.
It's a rare genetic disorder, it's systemic, it's a slowly progressing, premature aging disease.
It causes loose wrinkly skin in the flexor areas.
It causes legal blindness, like macular degeneration, and a host of cardiovascular problems.
Little is known about this disease, and some people die in their 30s, say some of the reports at the time.
He then just glances at our son and says, "He has it, too." We want to flee back to the land of normal.
Two days after Christmas, researchers come from a university in Boston, and they take blood from us and our children for a research project focused on finding the gene.
A few days later, researchers come from a medical center in New York and say they want blood, too. "These are children.
They're five and seven years old.
Don't make them face the needle twice.
Go and get your share from the other researchers. "They laugh, incredulous." Share? "It is then that we learn that there is little sharing in biomedical research.
This moment, more than any other, lit a fire beneath my husband Pat and me.
Pat and I went to a medical school library and we copied every article we could find on PXE.
We didn't understand a thing.
We bought medical dictionaries and scientific textbooks and read everything we could get our hands on.
And though we still didn't understand, we could see patterns, and it became quickly apparent within a month that there was no systematic effort to understand PXE.
In addition, the lack of sharing that we experienced was pervasive.
Researchers competed with each other because the ecosystem was designed to reward competition rather than to alleviate suffering.
We realized that we would have to do work on this condition ourselves to find solutions for ourselves and others like us.
But we faced two major barriers.
The first one: Pat and I have no science background.
At the time, he's the manager of a construction company, and I'm a former college chaplain stay-at-home mom -- hardly the backgrounds to take the research world by storm.
The second barrier: researchers don't share.
People told us you can't herd cats.
Well, yes you can if you move their food.
(Laughter)
DNA and clinical data is the food.
So we would collect blood and medical histories, and require that all scientists using these resources would share results with each other and with the people who donated.
Well before the internet was in common use, Pat and I established PXE International, a nonprofit dedicated to initiating research and conducting it on PXE and also supporting individuals with the disease.
Using traditional media, we garnered around 100-150 people around the world who we asked, would you give us your blood, your tissue, your medical histories, your medical records?
And we brought all of that together.
We quickly learned that this shared resource was not going to be enough.
And so we decided we had to do hardcore bench science -- hardcore research.
So we borrowed bench space at a lab at Harvard.
A wonderful neighbor came a couple times a week and sat with the kids from 8pm to 2am while Pat and I extracted DNA, ran and scored gels and searched for the gene.
Generous postdocs tutored us as we went along.
Within a few years, we found the gene.
We patented it so that it would be freely available.
We created a diagnostic test.
We put together a research consortium.
We held research meetings and opened a center of excellence.
We found more than 4,000 people around the world who had PXE, and held patient meetings and did clinical trials and studies.
Through all this, we lived with fear.
Fear of the disease breathing down our neck while the clock ticked.
Fear of researchers, so well credentialed and positioned in a world made for them.
Fear that we were making the wrong choices.
Fear that the naysayers were right and the cats would simply find a new food.
But greater than all these fears was our drive to make a difference for our kids and for all those we had met along the way.
And very quickly, we also realized what we were doing for one disease, we should do for all diseases.
We joined with, and I eventually led, Genetic Alliance -- a network of health advocacy, patient advocacy, research and health organizations.
We built scalable and extensible resources, like biobanks and registries and directories of support for all diseases.
And as I learned about all those diseases and all those disease communities, I realized that there were two secrets in health care that were impacting me greatly.
The first: there are no ready answers for people like my kids or all the people I was working with, whether common or rare conditions.
And the second secret: the answers lie in all of us together, donating our data, our biological samples and ultimately ourselves.
There is a small groundswell of individuals who are working to change this.
Citizen scientists, activists, hacks who are using crowdsourcing, do-it-yourself science are changing the game.
Even President Obama and Vice President Biden are evangelists for the idea that people should be partners in research.
This is a founding principle of our organization.
Sure, it's really hard to discover and develop interventions and therapies.
The science is hard, the regulatory regime is difficult.
There are a lot of stakeholders with lots of interests and misaligned incentives like publishing, promotion and tenure.
I don't fault scientists for following this path, but I challenge them and us to do this differently.
To recognize that people are at the center.
Genetic Alliance has experimented in what it will take to transform these crusty systems.
Our goal is to work without boundaries.
That sounds abstract, but for us it's quite practical.
When we're frustrated that entities won't share data -- data that comes from people who gave their energy, their time, their blood and even their tears -- we need to stop and ask, "How is it true that we could share, but we aren't?" We're part of this system, too.
How do we make it so that people can share ideas freely?
So that people can take risks and move closer to one another?
This leads to a dissolving of us versus them, not only for organizations but also for individuals.
If I'm going to ask organizations or individuals to strive for these standards, then I too need to explore my own being and my practices.
If I'm going to ask clinicians and researchers and administrators to take risks, then I, Sharon, need to take risks as well.
I need to face my personal fears.
My fear of not having enough impact.
My fear of not leading well.
My fear of not being enough.
Just before they entered their teens, our kids stopped us in our tracks and said, "You have to stop worrying about making a difference, making an impact, and instead, like us, learn to live with disease rather than fight it." I have to ask, where does all my fear come from?
The kids' declaration shines a spotlight on that fear.
It arises from a bedrock of love.
I love Elizabeth and Ian.
I love people with PXE.
I love people with any disease. I love people. Some of my colleagues have discovered that it is not death we fear, it is the enormity of our loving.
This expansive love opens me to great pain as I face loss.
As I discover my fear, I discover that I and all those around me have boundless capacity for love.
And I also discover as I move into this fear, that I can learn many new things and find paths to things like practical solutions as well as the core of healing and health.
I don't fear fear the way I used to.
In fact lately, with enormous support from all my fellow journeyers, I notice that it's not a warning the way it used to be.
I notice that instead, it's an invitation to go forward because in it lies love and the path to greater love.
If I turn with gentle curiosity toward that fear, I find enormous wealth within myself and others and the ability to step into challenges that I never thought I could.
My kids are ahead of me on that path still.
At ages 29 and 27, they declare they are happy and healthy despite having manifestations of PXE in their skin and eyes and arteries.
And so I invite you, us, we, to turn toward our fear; to embrace the things that scare us and find the love at the center.
We'll not only find ourselves there but we'll also be able to step into the shoes of those we fear and those who fear us.
If we breathe into that fear and are vulnerable with the systems and people who challenge us, our power as changemakers grows exponentially.
And when we realize that working on our inner life is working on our outer life and outer work is inner work, we get down to what is real and shit gets done.
(Laughter)
There is no limit to what we can accomplish together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My seven-year-old grandson sleeps just down the hall from me, and he wakes up a lot of mornings and he says, "You know, this could be the best day ever." And other times, in the middle of the night, he calls out in a tremulous voice, "Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"
I think this pretty much says it for me and most of the people I know, that we're a mixed grill of happy anticipation and dread.
So I sat down a few days before my 61st birthday, and I decided to compile a list of everything I know for sure.
There's so little truth in the popular culture, and it's good to be sure of a few things.
For instance, I am no longer 47, although this is the age I feel, and the age I like to think of myself as being.
My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s that he felt like a young man with something really wrong with him.
(Laughter)
Our true person is outside of time and space, but looking at the paperwork, I can, in fact, see that I was born in 1954.
My inside self is outside of time and space.
It doesn't have an age.
I'm every age I've ever been, and so are you, although I can't help mentioning as an aside that it might have been helpful if I hadn't followed the skin care rules of the '60s, which involved getting as much sun as possible while slathered in baby oil and basking in the glow of a tinfoil reflector shield.
(Laughter)
It was so liberating, though, to face the truth that I was no longer in the last throes of middle age, that I decided to write down every single true thing I know.
People feel really doomed and overwhelmed these days, and they keep asking me what's true.
So I hope that my list of things I'm almost positive about might offer some basic operating instructions to anyone who is feeling really overwhelmed or beleaguered.
Number one: the first and truest thing is that all truth is a paradox.
Life is both a precious, unfathomably beautiful gift, and it's impossible here, on the incarnational side of things.
It's been a very bad match for those of us who were born extremely sensitive.
It's so hard and weird that we sometimes wonder if we're being punked.
It's filled simultaneously with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty, desperate poverty, floods and babies and acne and Mozart, all swirled together.
I don't think it's an ideal system.
(Laughter)
Number two: almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
including you.
Three: there is almost nothing outside of you that will help in any kind of lasting way, unless you're waiting for an organ.
You can't buy, achieve or date serenity and peace of mind.
This is the most horrible truth, and I so resent it.
But it's an inside job, and we can't arrange peace or lasting improvement for the people we love most in the world.
They have to find their own ways, their own answers.
You can't run alongside your grown children with sunscreen and ChapStick on their hero's journey.
You have to release them.
It's disrespectful not to.
And if it's someone else's problem, you probably don't have the answer, anyway.
(Laughter)
Our help is usually not very helpful.
Our help is often toxic.
And help is the sunny side of control.
Stop helping so much.
Don't get your help and goodness all over everybody.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
This brings us to number four: everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy and scared, even the people who seem to have it most together.
They are much more like you than you would believe, so try not to compare your insides to other people's outsides.
It will only make you worse than you already are.
(Laughter)
Also, you can't save, fix or rescue any of them or get anyone sober.
What helped me get clean and sober 30 years ago was the catastrophe of my behavior and thinking.
So I asked some sober friends for help, and I turned to a higher power.
One acronym for God is the "gift of desperation," G-O-D, or as a sober friend put it, by the end I was deteriorating faster than I could lower my standards.
(Laughter)
So God might mean, in this case, "me running out of any more good ideas."
While fixing and saving and trying to rescue is futile, radical self-care is quantum, and it radiates out from you into the atmosphere like a little fresh air.
It's a huge gift to the world.
When people respond by saying, "Well, isn't she full of herself," just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa and make both of you a nice cup of tea.
Being full of affection for one's goofy, self-centered, cranky, annoying self is home.
It's where world peace begins.
Number five: chocolate with 75 percent cacao is not actually a food.
(Laughter)
Its best use is as a bait in snake traps or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs.
It was never meant to be considered an edible.
Number six --
(Laughter)
writing. Every writer you know writes really terrible first drafts, but they keep their butt in the chair.
That's the secret of life.
That's probably the main difference between you and them. They just do it. They do it by prearrangement with themselves.
They do it as a debt of honor.
They tell stories that come through them one day at a time, little by little.
When my older brother was in fourth grade, he had a term paper on birds due the next day, and he hadn't started.
So my dad sat down with him with an Audubon book, paper, pencils and brads -- for those of you who have gotten a little less young and remember brads -- and he said to my brother, "Just take it bird by bird, buddy.
Just read about pelicans and then write about pelicans in your own voice.
And then find out about chickadees, and tell us about them in your own voice.
And then geese."
So the two most important things about writing are: bird by bird and really god-awful first drafts.
If you don't know where to start, remember that every single thing that happened to you is yours, and you get to tell it.
If people wanted you to write more warmly about them, they should've behaved better.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You're going to feel like hell if you wake up someday and you never wrote the stuff that is tugging on the sleeves of your heart: your stories, memories, visions and songs -- your truth, your version of things -- in your own voice.
That's really all you have to offer us, and that's also why you were born.
Seven: publication and temporary creative successes are something you have to recover from.
They kill as many people as not.
They will hurt, damage and change you in ways you cannot imagine.
The most degraded and evil people I've ever known are male writers who've had huge best sellers.
And yet, returning to number one, that all truth is paradox, it's also a miracle to get your work published, to get your stories read and heard.
Just try to bust yourself gently of the fantasy that publication will heal you, that it will fill the Swiss-cheesy holes inside of you. It can't. It won't. But writing can. So can singing in a choir or a bluegrass band.
So can painting community murals or birding or fostering old dogs that no one else will.
Number eight: families. Families are hard, hard, hard, no matter how cherished and astonishing they may also be.
Again, see number one.
(Laughter)
At family gatherings where you suddenly feel homicidal or suicidal --
(Laughter)
remember that in all cases, it's a miracle that any of us, specifically, were conceived and born.
Earth is forgiveness school.
It begins with forgiving yourself, and then you might as well start at the dinner table.
That way, you can do this work in comfortable pants.
(Laughter)
When William Blake said that we are here to learn to endure the beams of love, he knew that your family would be an intimate part of this, even as you want to run screaming for your cute little life.
But I promise you are up to it.
You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it, and you will be amazed.
Nine: food. Try to do a little better.
I think you know what I mean.
(Laughter)
Number 10 --
(Laughter)
grace. Grace is spiritual WD-40, or water wings.
The mystery of grace is that God loves Henry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin and me exactly as much as He or She loves your new grandchild. Go figure.
(Laughter)
The movement of grace is what changes us, heals us and heals our world.
To summon grace, say, "Help," and then buckle up.
Grace finds you exactly where you are, but it doesn't leave you where it found you.
And grace won't look like Casper the Friendly Ghost, regrettably.
But the phone will ring or the mail will come and then against all odds, you'll get your sense of humor about yourself back.
Laughter really is carbonated holiness.
It helps us breathe again and again and gives us back to ourselves, and this gives us faith in life and each other.
And remember -- grace always bats last.
Eleven: God just means goodness.
It's really not all that scary.
It means the divine or a loving, animating intelligence, or, as we learned from the great "Deteriorata," "the cosmic muffin." A good name for God is: "Not me." Emerson said that the happiest person on Earth is the one who learns from nature the lessons of worship.
So go outside a lot and look up.
My pastor said you can trap bees on the bottom of mason jars without lids because they don't look up, so they just walk around bitterly bumping into the glass walls. Go outside. Look up. Secret of life.
And finally: death. Number 12. Wow and yikes. It's so hard to bear when the few people you cannot live without die.
You'll never get over these losses, and no matter what the culture says, you're not supposed to.
We Christians like to think of death as a major change of address, but in any case, the person will live again fully in your heart if you don't seal it off.
Like Leonard Cohen said, "There are cracks in everything, and that's how the light gets in." And that's how we feel our people again fully alive.
Also, the people will make you laugh out loud at the most inconvenient times, and that's the great good news.
But their absence will also be a lifelong nightmare of homesickness for you.
Grief and friends, time and tears will heal you to some extent.
Tears will bathe and baptize and hydrate and moisturize you and the ground on which you walk.
Do you know the first thing that God says to Moses?
He says, "Take off your shoes." Because this is holy ground, all evidence to the contrary.
It's hard to believe, but it's the truest thing I know.
When you're a little bit older, like my tiny personal self, you realize that death is as sacred as birth.
And don't worry -- get on with your life.
Almost every single death is easy and gentle with the very best people surrounding you for as long as you need.
You won't be alone.
They'll help you cross over to whatever awaits us.
As Ram Dass said, "When all is said and done, we're really just all walking each other home."
I think that's it, but if I think of anything else, I'll let you know.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I was very surprised to be asked to come, because it is not my realm, technology or design or entertainment.
I mean, my realm is sort of faith and writing and kind of lurching along together.
And I was surprised, but they said I could give a talk, and I said I'd love to.
(Video) If you don't know where to start, remember that every single thing that happened to you is yours and you get to tell it.
Anne Lamott: People are very frightened and feel really doomed in America these days, and I just wanted to help people get their sense of humor about it and to realize how much isn't a problem.
If you take an action, take a really healthy or loving or friendly action, you'll have loving and friendly feelings.
I want you to imagine walking into a room, a control room with a bunch of people, a hundred people, hunched over a desk with little dials, and that that control room will shape the thoughts and feelings of a billion people.
This might sound like science fiction, but this actually exists right now, today.
I know because I used to be in one of those control rooms.
I was a design ethicist at Google, where I studied how do you ethically steer people's thoughts?
Because what we don't talk about is how the handful of people working at a handful of technology companies through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today.
Because when you pull out your phone and they design how this works or what's on the feed, it's scheduling little blocks of time in our minds.
If you see a notification, it schedules you to have thoughts that maybe you didn't intend to have.
If you swipe over that notification, it schedules you into spending a little bit of time getting sucked into something that maybe you didn't intend to get sucked into.
When we talk about technology, we tend to talk about it as this blue sky opportunity. It could go any direction.
And I want to get serious for a moment and tell you why it's going in a very specific direction.
Because it's not evolving randomly.
There's a hidden goal driving the direction of all of the technology we make, and that goal is the race for our attention.
Because every news site — TED, elections, politicians, games, even meditation apps — have to compete for one thing, which is our attention, and there's only so much of it.
And the best way to get people's attention is to know how someone's mind works.
And there's a whole bunch of persuasive techniques that I learned in college at a lab called the Persuasive Technology Lab to get people's attention.
A simple example is YouTube.
YouTube wants to maximize how much time you spend. And so what do they do? They autoplay the next video.
And let's say that works really well.
They're getting a little bit more of people's time.
Well, if you're Netflix, you look at that and say, well, that's shrinking my market share, so I'm going to autoplay the next episode.
But then if you're Facebook, you say, that's shrinking all of my market share, so now I have to autoplay all the videos in the newsfeed before waiting for you to click play.
So the internet is not evolving at random.
The reason it feels like it's sucking us in the way it is is because of this race for attention.
We know where this is going.
Technology is not neutral, and it becomes this race to the bottom of the brain stem of who can go lower to get it.
Let me give you an example of Snapchat.
If you didn't know, Snapchat is the number one way that teenagers in the United States communicate.
So if you're like me, and you use text messages to communicate, Snapchat is that for teenagers, and there's, like, a hundred million of them that use it.
And they invented a feature called Snapstreaks, which shows the number of days in a row that two people have communicated with each other.
In other words, what they just did is they gave two people something they don't want to lose.
Because if you're a teenager, and you have 150 days in a row, you don't want that to go away.
And so think of the little blocks of time that that schedules in kids' minds.
This isn't theoretical: when kids go on vacation, it's been shown they give their passwords to up to five other friends to keep their Snapstreaks going, even when they can't do it.
And they have, like, 30 of these things, and so they have to get through taking photos of just pictures or walls or ceilings just to get through their day.
So it's not even like they're having real conversations.
We have a temptation to think about this as, oh, they're just using Snapchat the way we used to gossip on the telephone.
It's probably OK.
Well, what this misses is that in the 1970s, when you were just gossiping on the telephone, there wasn't a hundred engineers on the other side of the screen who knew exactly how your psychology worked and orchestrated you into a double bind with each other.
Now, if this is making you feel a little bit of outrage, notice that that thought just comes over you.
Outrage is a really good way also of getting your attention, because we don't choose outrage. It happens to us. And if you're the Facebook newsfeed, whether you'd want to or not, you actually benefit when there's outrage.
Because outrage doesn't just schedule a reaction in emotional time, space, for you.
We want to share that outrage with other people.
So we want to hit share and say, "Can you believe the thing that they said?" And so outrage works really well at getting attention, such that if Facebook had a choice between showing you the outrage feed and a calm newsfeed, they would want to show you the outrage feed, not because someone consciously chose that, but because that worked better at getting your attention.
And the newsfeed control room is not accountable to us.
It's only accountable to maximizing attention.
It's also accountable, because of the business model of advertising, for anybody who can pay the most to actually walk into the control room and say, "That group over there, I want to schedule these thoughts into their minds." So you can target, you can precisely target a lie directly to the people who are most susceptible.
And because this is profitable, it's only going to get worse.
So I'm here today because the costs are so obvious.
I don't know a more urgent problem than this, because this problem is underneath all other problems.
It's not just taking away our agency to spend our attention and live the lives that we want, it's changing the way that we have our conversations, it's changing our democracy, and it's changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships we want with each other.
And it affects everyone, because a billion people have one of these in their pocket.
So how do we fix this? We need to make three radical changes to technology and to our society.
The first is we need to acknowledge that we are persuadable.
Once you start understanding that your mind can be scheduled into having little thoughts or little blocks of time that you didn't choose, wouldn't we want to use that understanding and protect against the way that that happens?
I think we need to see ourselves fundamentally in a new way.
It's almost like a new period of human history, like the Enlightenment, but almost a kind of self-aware Enlightenment, that we can be persuaded, and there might be something we want to protect.
The second is we need new models and accountability systems so that as the world gets better and more and more persuasive over time -- because it's only going to get more persuasive -- that the people in those control rooms are accountable and transparent to what we want.
The only form of ethical persuasion that exists is when the goals of the persuader are aligned with the goals of the persuadee.
And that involves questioning big things, like the business model of advertising.
Lastly, we need a design renaissance, because once you have this view of human nature, that you can steer the timelines of a billion people — just imagine, there's people who have some desire about what they want to do and what they want to be thinking and what they want to be feeling and how they want to be informed, and we're all just tugged into these other directions.
And you have a billion people just tugged into all these different directions.
Well, imagine an entire design renaissance that tried to orchestrate the exact and most empowering time-well-spent way for those timelines to happen.
And that would involve two things: one would be protecting against the timelines that we don't want to be experiencing, the thoughts that we wouldn't want to be happening, so that when that ding happens, not having the ding that sends us away; and the second would be empowering us to live out the timeline that we want.
You open up Facebook. And in that moment, the designers in the control room want to schedule exactly one thing, which is to maximize how much time you spend on the screen.
Now, instead, imagine if those designers created a different timeline that was the easiest way, using all of their data, to actually help you get out with the people that you care about?
Just think, alleviating all loneliness in society, if that was the timeline that Facebook wanted to make possible for people.
Or imagine a different conversation.
Let's say you wanted to post something supercontroversial on Facebook, which is a really important thing to be able to do, to talk about controversial topics.
And right now, when there's that big comment box, it's almost asking you, what key do you want to type?
In other words, it's scheduling a little timeline of things you're going to continue to do on the screen.
And imagine instead that there was another button there saying, what would be most time well spent for you? And you click "host a dinner." And right there underneath the item it said, "Who wants to RSVP for the dinner?" And so you'd still have a conversation about something controversial, but you'd be having it in the most empowering place on your timeline, which would be at home that night with a bunch of a friends over to talk about it.
So imagine we're running, like, a find and replace on all of the timelines that are currently steering us towards more and more screen time persuasively and replacing all of those timelines with what do we want in our lives.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Instead of handicapping our attention, imagine if we used all of this data and all of this power and this new view of human nature to give us a superhuman ability to focus and a superhuman ability to put our attention to what we cared about and a superhuman ability to have the conversations that we need to have for democracy.
The most complex challenges in the world require not just us to use our attention individually.
They require us to use our attention and coordinate it together.
Climate change is going to require that a lot of people are being able to coordinate their attention in the most empowering way together.
And imagine creating a superhuman ability to do that.
Sometimes the world's most pressing and important problems are not these hypothetical future things that we could create in the future.
Sometimes the most pressing problems are the ones that are right underneath our noses, the things that are already directing a billion people's thoughts.
And maybe instead of getting excited about the new augmented reality and virtual reality and these cool things that could happen, which are going to be susceptible to the same race for attention, if we could fix the race for attention on the thing that's already in a billion people's pockets.
Maybe instead of getting excited about the most exciting new cool fancy education apps, we could fix the way kids' minds are getting manipulated into sending empty messages back and forth.
(Applause)
Maybe instead of worrying about hypothetical future runaway artificial intelligences that are maximizing for one goal, we could solve the runaway artificial intelligence that already exists right now, which are these newsfeeds maximizing for one thing.
It's almost like instead of running away to colonize new planets, we could fix the one that we're already on.
(Applause)
Solving this problem is critical infrastructure for solving every other problem.
There's nothing in your life or in our collective problems that does not require our ability to put our attention where we care about.
At the end of our lives, all we have is our attention and our time.
What will be time well spent for ours?
Thank you.
First of all, thank you.
I know we asked you to do this talk on pretty short notice, and you've had quite a stressful week getting this thing together, so thank you.
Some people listening might say, what you complain about is addiction, and all these people doing this stuff, for them it's actually interesting.
All these design decisions have built user content that is fantastically interesting.
The world's more interesting than it ever has been.
What's wrong with that?
Tristan Harris: I think it's really interesting.
One way to see this is if you're just YouTube, for example, you want to always show the more interesting next video.
You want to get better and better at suggesting that next video, but even if you could propose the perfect next video that everyone would want to watch, it would just be better and better at keeping you hooked on the screen.
So what's missing in that equation is figuring out what our boundaries would be.
You would want YouTube to know something about, say, falling asleep.
The CEO of Netflix recently said, "our biggest competitors are Facebook, YouTube and sleep." And so what we need to recognize is that the human architecture is limited and that we have certain boundaries or dimensions of our lives that we want to be honored and respected, and technology could help do that.
CA: I mean, could you make the case that part of the problem here is that we've got a naïve model of human nature?
So much of this is justified in terms of human preference, where we've got these algorithms that do an amazing job of optimizing for human preference, but which preference?
There's the preferences of things that we really care about when we think about them versus the preferences of what we just instinctively click on.
If we could implant that more nuanced view of human nature in every design, would that be a step forward?
TH: Absolutely. I mean, I think right now it's as if all of our technology is basically only asking our lizard brain what's the best way to just impulsively get you to do the next tiniest thing with your time, instead of asking you in your life what we would be most time well spent for you?
What would be the perfect timeline that might include something later, would be time well spent for you here at TED in your last day here?
CA: So if Facebook and Google and everyone said to us first up, "Hey, would you like us to optimize for your reflective brain or your lizard brain? You choose."
TH: Right. That would be one way. Yes.
CA: You said persuadability, that's an interesting word to me because to me there's two different types of persuadability.
There's the persuadability that we're trying right now of reason and thinking and making an argument, but I think you're almost talking about a different kind, a more visceral type of persuadability, of being persuaded without even knowing that you're thinking.
TH: Exactly. The reason I care about this problem so much is I studied at a lab called the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford that taught [students how to recognize] exactly these techniques.
There's conferences and workshops that teach people all these covert ways of getting people's attention and orchestrating people's lives.
And it's because most people don't know that that exists that this conversation is so important.
CA: Tristan, you and I, we both know so many people from all these companies.
There are actually many here in the room, and I don't know about you, but my experience of them is that there is no shortage of good intent.
People want a better world.
They are actually -- they really want it.
And I don't think anything you're saying is that these are evil people.
It's a system where there's these unintended consequences that have really got out of control --
TH: Of this race for attention.
It's the classic race to the bottom when you have to get attention, and it's so tense.
The only way to get more is to go lower on the brain stem, to go lower into outrage, to go lower into emotion, to go lower into the lizard brain.
CA: Well, thank you so much for helping us all get a little bit wiser about this.
Tristan Harris, thank you. TH: Thank you very much.
I am from the South Side of Chicago, and in seventh grade, I had a best friend named Jenny who lived on the Southwest Side of Chicago.
Jenny was white, and if you know anything about the segregated demographics of Chicago, you know that there are not too many black people who live on the Southwest Side of Chicago.
But Jenny was my girl and so we would hang out every so often after school and on the weekends.
And so one day we were hanging out in her living room, talking about 13-year-old things, and Jenny's little sister Rosie was in the room with us, and she was sitting behind me just kind of playing in my hair, and I wasn't thinking too much about what she was doing.
But at a pause in the conversation, Rosie tapped me on the shoulder.
She said, "Can I ask you a question?"
I said, "Yeah, Rosie. Sure."
"Are you black?"
(Laughter)
The room froze. Silence. Jenny and Rosie's mom was not too far away.
She was in the kitchen and she overheard the conversation, and she was mortified.
She said, "Rosie!
You can't ask people questions like that. "And Jenny was my friend, and I know she was really embarrassed.
I felt kind of bad for her, but actually I was not offended.
I figured it wasn't Rosie's fault that in her 10 short years on this earth, living on the Southwest Side of Chicago, she wasn't 100 percent sure what a black person looked like. That's fair. But what was more surprising to me was, in all of this time I had spent with Jenny and Rosie's family -- hanging out with them, playing with them, even physically interacting with them -- it was not until Rosie put her hands in my hair that she thought to ask me if I was black.
That was the first time I would realize how big of a role the texture of my hair played in confirming my ethnicity, but also that it would play a key role in how I'm viewed by others in society.
Garrett A. Morgan and Madame CJ Walker were pioneers of the black hair-care and beauty industry in the early 1900s.
They're best known as the inventors of chemically-based hair creams and heat straightening tools designed to permanently, or semipermanently, alter the texture of black hair.
Oftentimes when we think about the history of blacks in America, we think about the heinous acts and numerous injustices that we experienced as people of color because of the color of our skin, when in fact, in post-Civil War America, it was the hair of an African-American male or female that was known as the most "telling feature" of Negro status, more so than the color of the skin.
And so before they were staples of the multibillion-dollar hair-care industry, our dependency on tools and products, like the hair relaxer and the pressing comb, were more about our survival and advancement as a race in postslavery America.
Over the years, we grew accustomed to this idea that straighter and longer hair meant better and more beautiful.
We became culturally obsessed with this idea of having what we like to call ... "good hair." This essentially means: the looser the curl pattern, the better the hair.
And we let these institutionalized ideas form a false sense of hierarchy that would determine what was considered a good grade of hair and what was not.
What's worse is that we let these false ideologies invade our perception of ourselves, and they still continue to infect our cultural identity as African-American women today.
So what did we do?
We went to the hair salon every six to eight weeks, without fail, to subject our scalps to harsh straightening chemicals beginning at a very young age -- sometimes eight, 10 -- that would result in hair loss, bald spots, sometimes even burns on the scalp.
We fry our hair at temperatures of 450 degrees Fahrenheit or higher almost daily, to maintain the straight look.
Or we simply cover our hair up with wigs and weaves, only to let our roots breathe in private where no one knows what's really going on under there.
We adopted these practices in our own communities, and so it's no wonder why today the typical ideal vision of a professional black woman, especially in corporate America, tends to look like this, rather than like this.
And she certainly doesn't look like this.
In September of this year, a federal court ruled it lawful for a company to discriminate against hiring an employee based on if she or he wears dreadlocks.
In the case, the hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama is on record as saying, "I'm not saying yours are messy, but... you know what I'm talking about." Well, what was she talking about?
Did she think that they were ugly?
Or maybe they were just a little too Afrocentric and pro-black-looking for her taste.
Or maybe it's not about Afrocentricity, and it's more just about it being a little too "urban" for the professional setting.
Perhaps she had a genuine concern in that they looked "scary" and that they would intimidate the clients and their customer base.
All of these words are ones that are too often associated with the stigma attached to natural hairstyles.
And this ... this has got to change.
In 2013, a white paper published by the Deloitte Leadership Center for Inclusion, studied 3,000 individuals in executive leadership roles on the concept of covering in the workplace based on appearance, advocacy, affiliation and association.
When thinking about appearance-based covering, the study showed that 67 percent of women of color cover in the workplace based on their appearance.
Of the total respondents who admitted to appearance-based covering, 82 percent said that it was somewhat to extremely important for them to do so for their professional advancement.
Now, this is Ursula Burns. She is the first African-American female CEO of a Fortune 500 company — of Xerox.
She's known by her signature look, the one that you see here.
A short, nicely trimmed, well-manicured Afro.
Ms. Burns is what we like to call a "natural girl." And she is paving the way and showing what's possible for African-American women seeking to climb the corporate ladder, but still wishing to wear natural hairstyles.
But today the majority of African-American women who we still look to as leaders, icons and role models, still opt for a straight-hair look.
Now, maybe it's because they want to — this is authentically how they feel best — but maybe — and I bet — a part of them felt like they had to in order to reach the level of success that they have attained today.
There is a natural hair movement that is sweeping the country and also in some places in Europe.
Millions of women are exploring what it means to transition to natural hair, and they're cutting off years and years of dry, damaged ends in order to restore their natural curl pattern.
I know because I have been an advocate and an ambassador for this movement for roughly the last three years.
After 27 years of excessive heat and harsh chemicals, my hair was beginning to show extreme signs of wear and tear.
It was breaking off, it was thinning, looking just extremely dry and brittle.
All those years of chasing that conventional image of beauty that we saw earlier was finally beginning to take its toll.
I wanted to do something about it, and so I started what I called the "No Heat Challenge," where I would refrain from using heat styling tools on my hair for six months.
And like a good millennial, I documented it on social media.
(Laughter)
I documented as I reluctantly cut off three to four inches of my beloved hair.
I documented as I struggled to master these natural hairstyles, and also as I struggled to embrace them and think that they actually looked good.
And I documented as my hair texture slowly began to change.
By sharing this journey openly, I learned that I was not the only woman going through this and that in fact there were thousands and thousands of other women who were longing to do the same.
So they would reach out to me and they would say, "Cheyenne, how did you do that natural hairstyle that I saw you with the other day?
What new products have you started using that might be a little better for my hair texture as it begins to change?" Or, "What are some of the natural hair routines that I should begin to adopt to slowly restore the health of my hair?" But I also found that there were a large number of women who were extremely hesitant to take that first step because they were paralyzed by fear.
Fear of the unknown -- what would they now look like?
How would they feel about themselves with these natural hairstyles?
And most importantly to them, how would others view them?
Over the last three years of having numerous conversations with friends of mine and also complete strangers from around the world, I learned some really important things about how African-American women identify with their hair.
And so when I think back to that hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama, I'd say, "Actually, no.
We don't know what you're talking about." But here are some things that we do know.
We know that when black women embrace their love for their natural hair, it helps to undo generations of teaching that black in its natural state is not beautiful, or something to be hidden or covered up.
We know that black women express their individuality and experience feelings of empowerment by experimenting with different hairstyles regularly.
And we also know that when we're invited to wear our natural hair in the workplace, it reinforces that we are uniquely valued and thus helps us to flourish and advance professionally.
I leave you with this.
In a time of racial and social tension, embracing this movement and others like this help us to rise above the confines of the status quo.
So when you see a woman with braids or locks draping down her back, or you notice your colleague who has stopped straightening her hair to work, do not simply approach her and admire and ask her if you can touch it — (Laughter) Really appreciate her. Applaud her. Heck, even high-five her if that's what you feel so inclined to do.
Because this -- this is more than about a hairstyle.
It's about self-love and self-worth.
It's about being brave enough not to fold under the pressure of others' expectations.
And about knowing that making the decision to stray from the norm does not define who we are, but it simply reveals who we are.
And finally, being brave is easier when we can count on the compassion of others.
So after today, I certainly hope that we can count on you.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Michael Browning: engineer, innovator -- inventor, really -- and inspiring father.
He had a passion for flight, as you can kind of sense from that rather dubious 1970s office-leaving present.
And some 40 years after that was created, a small group of us got together to have a go, a run at the whole challenge of flight that inspired people for years, and do it in a very different kind of way.
And that's the journey I'd like to share with you now.
The starting hypothesis was one of the human mind and body, which, as you've seen for the last few days here, is an amazing construct.
What if you augmented that wonderful machine with just the right technology?
If you approach flight in that kind of real way, where could you get to?
So my training partner here back in London, Denton, is doing a much better job of that kind of stuff than me. Guess what? It's London. The idea was that you augment that.
And so, how do you augment that?
Well, we bought one of these.
This is a micro gas turbine.
This was ground zero, so that little piece of kit proved really quite impressive, so we got two in a field.
The real hero here, by the way, is, right in the background, there's a lady tending some vegetables, who does a brilliant job of trying to ignore us for a while --
(Laughter)
I think the only thing less happy is the grass, that we did probably damage quite badly.
You get an idea of the thrust here, when I try to hold them horizontally and somewhat fail.
That's around 50 kilos of thrust there.
We were quite impressed with that.
We thought we were getting somewhere.
So there's only one sensible way to go from there: you get four.
(Laughter)
I have to say, I still like watching these back.
So then we thought well, let's try and spread the load a bit.
The legs are designed to take the load, so why don't we spread it out a bit?
That bit was good.
(Laughter) The harness -- a nice idea but it didn't really work, as you'll see now. This whole journey was very much about trying things --
Yeah, it really didn't work, did it?
Trying things and learning by failing at them most of the time.
And that included failing by falling over.
If you notice, we've got five engines here -- not to be put off by the fact one was in maintenance, still had a go.
(Laughter)
And then I pinched a fuel line.
So again, good learning.
We learned not to do that again.
This was a blind alley.
(Laughter)
This was three on each arm -- that was ridiculous.
That was 70 kilos on each arm.
Again, struck that one off.
(Laughter)
But we were starting to make some really quite convincing progress, just enough to make you believe that maybe -- maybe we could get there.
You can see, look -- tantalizing.
The model of one on each leg and two on each arm, on paper, that was enough thrust.
And then we did what I'm about to show you now, and I still love watching this one.
This was our first six-second, reasonably coherent flight.
(Applause)
That was the point where this endeavor went from: "I'm really not sure this is going to work," to: "Oh my god, it does work!" From there on we then refined it, but we carried on falling over a lot.
Falling over, like I say, is definitely the best way to learn.
After a while, we starting really refining the layout of all of this.
And you'll see, that's stability and control -- there's no wires there or anything -- that's a combination of us refining the technology, including with a Tupperware box on the back for the electronics and actually learning the balance and control.
I'm now going to save your ears for the next short piece and talk over it.
After a while, the jet engine noise is a bit annoying.
This is only a few weeks ago.
You can see the stability and control is really quite nice, and I'd like to think this somewhat validates that starting hypothesis, that the human mind and body, if properly augmented in that way, can achieve some pretty cool stuff.
I mean, like I said: I'm not thinking about where I'm moving my arms at that stage.
I'm looking at the objective of where I want to get to, and a bit like riding a bike, my arms are just doing their thing.
It's a very strange experience.
So where is all this headed?
I'll talk over this landing — I think I land in this one.
Well, I don't think anybody's going to go down to Walmart or take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while, but the team at Gravity are building some awesome technology that's going to make this look like child's play.
We're working on some things that will seek to bring this unusual experience of flight to a wider audience, beyond the events and displays we're doing.
We're even starting to look for pilots two and three, if there's any volunteers.
I've got this vision.
It sounds audacious, but let's just stick it out there, that one day maybe we can rise up above a beach, fly up and down the coastline of it, rise up a bit higher, with some of the safety kit we're working on to make this achievable.
Then over the horizon comes a Hercules with the ramp down.
As it comes past, you start picking up speed and see if we can intercept -- from the rear, not the front, that would be a mistake -- and then try and land in the back.
And as I say, that's a little way off at the moment.
But this is also, if I take a big step back from this, this is also a very personal journey for me.
Back to that lovely photo, or photo in a picture.
Sadly, my father took his own life when I was 15, and left an awful lot of unfulfilled ambition.
He was a wonderful inventor, a maverick creator.
And I'd just like to think, if it was possible, if he was looking down, he would be -- he'd certainly be smiling at some of the things we've done here, I think.
So, it's a tribute to him.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Voice-over) Richard Browning: I'm probably more nervous about doing the demo after this.
I've got a lot of things to get done today.
Worst-case scenario, we don't get a clean start.
Or we get an unplanned failure while I'm actually flying around.
This is why we keep it very low, so the worst is I just look like an idiot and fall on my rear, as I said.
So you can all enjoy that if that happens.
(Music) (Jet engine accelerates)
I'm going to speak to you about the global refugee crisis and my aim is to show you that this crisis is manageable, not unsolvable, but also show you that this is as much about us and who we are as it is a trial of the refugees on the front line.
For me, this is not just a professional obligation, because I run an NGO supporting refugees and displaced people around the world. It's personal.
I love this picture. That really handsome guy on the right, that's not me.
That's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940 with his father Samuel.
They were Jewish refugees from Belgium.
They fled the day the Nazis invaded.
And I love this picture, too.
It's a group of refugee children arriving in England in 1946 from Poland.
And in the middle is my mother, Marion.
She was sent to start a new life in a new country on her own at the age of 12.
I know this: if Britain had not admitted refugees in the 1940s, I certainly would not be here today.
Yet 70 years on, the wheel has come full circle.
The sound is of walls being built, vengeful political rhetoric, humanitarian values and principles on fire in the very countries that 70 years ago said never again to statelessness and hopelessness for the victims of war.
Last year, every minute, 24 more people were displaced from their homes by conflict, violence and persecution: another chemical weapon attack in Syria, the Taliban on the rampage in Afghanistan, girls driven from their school in northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram.
These are not people moving to another country to get a better life.
They're fleeing for their lives.
It's a real tragedy that the world's most famous refugee can't come to speak to you here today.
Many of you will know this picture.
It shows the lifeless body of five-year-old Alan Kurdi, a Syrian refugee who died in the Mediterranean in 2015. He died alongside 3,700 others trying to get to Europe.
The next year, 2016, 5,000 people died.
It's too late for them, but it's not too late for millions of others.
It's not too late for people like Frederick.
I met him in the Nyarugusu refugee camp in Tanzania.
He's from Burundi.
He wanted to know where could he complete his studies.
He'd done 11 years of schooling. He wanted a 12th year.
He said to me, "I pray that my days do not end here in this refugee camp."
And it's not too late for Halud.
Her parents were Palestinian refugees living in the Yarmouk refugee camp outside Damascus.
She was born to refugee parents, and now she's a refugee herself in Lebanon.
She's working for the International Rescue Committee to help other refugees, but she has no certainty at all about her future, where it is or what it holds.
This talk is about Frederick, about Halud and about millions like them: why they're displaced, how they survive, what help they need and what our responsibilities are.
I truly believe this, that the biggest question in the 21st century concerns our duty to strangers.
The future "you" is about your duties to strangers.
You know better than anyone, the world is more connected than ever before, yet the great danger is that we're consumed by our divisions.
And there is no better test of that than how we treat refugees.
Here are the facts: 65 million people displaced from their homes by violence and persecution last year.
If it was a country, that would be the 21st largest country in the world.
Most of those people, about 40 million, stay within their own home country, but 25 million are refugees.
That means they cross a border into a neighboring state.
Most of them are living in poor countries, relatively poor or lower-middle-income countries, like Lebanon, where Halud is living.
In Lebanon, one in four people is a refugee, a quarter of the whole population.
And refugees stay for a long time.
The average length of displacement is 10 years.
I went to what was the world's largest refugee camp, in eastern Kenya.
It's called Dadaab.
It was built in 1991-92 as a "temporary camp" for Somalis fleeing the civil war. I met Silo. And naïvely I said to Silo, "Do you think you'll ever go home to Somalia?" And she said, "What do you mean, go home?
I was born here." And then when I asked the camp management how many of the 330,000 people in that camp were born there, they gave me the answer: 100,000.
That's what long-term displacement means.
Now, the causes of this are deep: weak states that can't support their own people, an international political system weaker than at any time since 1945 and differences over theology, governance, engagement with the outside world in significant parts of the Muslim world.
Now, those are long-term, generational challenges.
That's why I say that this refugee crisis is a trend and not a blip.
And it's complex, and when you have big, large, long-term, complex problems, people think nothing can be done.
When Pope Francis went to Lampedusa, off the coast of Italy, in 2014, he accused all of us and the global population of what he called "the globalization of indifference." It's a haunting phrase.
It means that our hearts have turned to stone.
Now, I don't know, you tell me. Are you allowed to argue with the Pope, even at a TED conference?
But I think it's not right.
I think people do want to make a difference, but they just don't know whether there are any solutions to this crisis.
And what I want to tell you today is that though the problems are real, the solutions are real, too.
Solution one: these refugees need to get into work in the countries where they're living, and the countries where they're living need massive economic support.
In Uganda in 2014, they did a study: 80 percent of refugees in the capital city Kampala needed no humanitarian aid because they were working.
They were supported into work.
Solution number two: education for kids is a lifeline, not a luxury, when you're displaced for so long.
Kids can bounce back when they're given the proper social, emotional support alongside literacy and numeracy.
I've seen it for myself.
But half of the world's refugee children of primary school age get no education at all, and three-quarters of secondary school age get no education at all. That's crazy.
Solution number three: most refugees are in urban areas, in cities, not in camps.
What would you or I want if we were a refugee in a city?
We would want money to pay rent or buy clothes.
That is the future of the humanitarian system, or a significant part of it: give people cash so that you boost the power of refugees and you'll help the local economy.
And there's a fourth solution, too, that's controversial but needs to be talked about.
The most vulnerable refugees need to be given a new start and a new life in a new country, including in the West.
The numbers are relatively small, hundreds of thousands, not millions, but the symbolism is huge.
Now is not the time to be banning refugees, as the Trump administration proposes.
It's a time to be embracing people who are victims of terror. And remember --
(Applause)
Remember, anyone who asks you, "Are they properly vetted?" that's a really sensible and good question to ask.
The truth is, refugees arriving for resettlement are more vetted than any other population arriving in our countries.
So while it's reasonable to ask the question, it's not reasonable to say that refugee is another word for terrorist.
Now, what happens --
(Applause)
What happens when refugees can't get work, they can't get their kids into school, they can't get cash, they can't get a legal route to hope?
What happens is they take risky journeys.
I went to Lesbos, this beautiful Greek island, two years ago.
It's a home to 90,000 people.
In one year, 500,000 refugees went across the island.
And I want to show you what I saw when I drove across to the north of the island: a pile of life jackets of those who had made it to shore.
And when I looked closer, there were small life jackets for children, yellow ones.
And I took this picture.
You probably can't see the writing, but I want to read it for you. "Warning: will not protect against drowning." So in the 21st century, children are being given life jackets to reach safety in Europe even though those jackets will not save their lives if they fall out of the boat that is taking them there.
This is not just a crisis, it's a test.
It's a test that civilizations have faced down the ages.
It's a test of our humanity.
It's a test of us in the Western world of who we are and what we stand for.
It's a test of our character, not just our policies.
And refugees are a hard case.
They do come from faraway parts of the world.
They have been through trauma.
They're often of a different religion.
Those are precisely the reasons we should be helping refugees, not a reason not to help them.
And it's a reason to help them because of what it says about us.
It's revealing of our values.
Empathy and altruism are two of the foundations of civilization.
Turn that empathy and altruism into action and we live out a basic moral credo.
And in the modern world, we have no excuse.
We can't say we don't know what's happening in Juba, South Sudan, or Aleppo, Syria.
It's there, in our smartphone in our hand.
Ignorance is no excuse at all.
Fail to help, and we show we have no moral compass at all.
It's also revealing about whether we know our own history.
The reason that refugees have rights around the world is because of extraordinary Western leadership by statesmen and women after the Second World War that became universal rights.
Trash the protections of refugees, and we trash our own history. This is --
(Applause)
This is also revealing about the power of democracy as a refuge from dictatorship.
How many politicians have you heard say, "We believe in the power of our example, not the example of our power." What they mean is what we stand for is more important than the bombs we drop.
Refugees seeking sanctuary have seen the West as a source of hope and a place of haven.
Russians, Iranians, Chinese, Eritreans, Cubans, they've come to the West for safety.
We throw that away at our peril.
And there's one other thing it reveals about us: whether we have any humility for our own mistakes.
I'm not one of these people who believes that all the problems in the world are caused by the West. They're not. But when we make mistakes, we should recognize it.
It's not an accident that the country which has taken more refugees than any other, the United States, has taken more refugees from Vietnam than any other country.
It speaks to the history.
But there's more recent history, in Iraq and Afghanistan.
You can't make up for foreign policy errors by humanitarian action, but when you break something, you have a duty to try to help repair it, and that's our duty now.
Do you remember at the beginning of the talk, I said I wanted to explain that the refugee crisis was manageable, not insoluble? That's true. I want you to think in a new way, but I also want you to do things.
If you're an employer, hire refugees.
If you're persuaded by the arguments, take on the myths when family or friends or workmates repeat them.
If you've got money, give it to charities that make a difference for refugees around the world.
If you're a citizen, vote for politicians who will put into practice the solutions that I've talked about.
(Applause)
The duty to strangers shows itself in small ways and big, prosaic and heroic.
In 1942, my aunt and my grandmother were living in Brussels under German occupation.
They received a summons from the Nazi authorities to go to Brussels Railway Station.
My grandmother immediately thought something was amiss.
She pleaded with her relatives not to go to Brussels Railway Station.
Her relatives said to her, "If we don't go, if we don't do what we're told, then we're going to be in trouble." You can guess what happened to the relatives who went to Brussels Railway Station.
They were never seen again.
But my grandmother and my aunt, they went to a small village south of Brussels where they'd been on holiday in the decade before, and they presented themselves at the house of the local farmer, a Catholic farmer called Monsieur Maurice, and they asked him to take them in.
And he did, and by the end of the war, 17 Jews, I was told, were living in that village.
And when I was teenager, I asked my aunt, "Can you take me to meet Monsieur Maurice?" And she said, "Yeah, I can.
He's still alive.
Let's go and see him. "And so, it must have been '83,' 84, we went to see him.
And I suppose, like only a teenager could, when I met him, he was this white-haired gentleman, I said to him, "Why did you do it?
Why did you take that risk? "And he looked at me and he shrugged, and he said, in French," On doit. "" One must. "It was innate in him. It was natural. And my point to you is it should be natural and innate in us, too.
Tell yourself, this refugee crisis is manageable, not unsolvable, and each one of us has a personal responsibility to help make it so.
Because this is about the rescue of us and our values as well as the rescue of refugees and their lives.
Thank you very much indeed.
Bruno Giussani: David, thank you.
David Miliband: Thank you.
BG: Those are strong suggestions and your call for individual responsibility is very strong as well, but I'm troubled by one thought, and it's this: you mentioned, and these are your words, "extraordinary Western leadership" which led 60-something years ago to the whole discussion about human rights, to the conventions on refugees, etc. etc. That leadership happened after a big trauma and happened in a consensual political space, and now we are in a divisive political space.
Actually, refugees have become one of the divisive issues.
So where will leadership come from today?
DM: Well, I think that you're right to say that the leadership forged in war has a different temper and a different tempo and a different outlook than leadership forged in peace.
And so my answer would be the leadership has got to come from below, not from above.
I mean, a recurring theme of the conference this week has been about the democratization of power.
And we've got to preserve our own democracies, but we've got to also activate our own democracies.
And when people say to me, "There's a backlash against refugees," what I say to them is, "No, there's a polarization, and at the moment, those who are fearful are making more noise than those who are proud." And so my answer to your question is that we will sponsor and encourage and give confidence to leadership when we mobilize ourselves.
And I think that when you are in a position of looking for leadership, you have to look inside and mobilize in your own community to try to create conditions for a different kind of settlement.
BG: Thank you, David.
Thanks for coming to TED.
I just want to share with you what I have been experiencing over the last five years in having the great privilege of traveling to many of the poorest countries in the world.
This scene is one I see all the time everywhere, and these young children are looking at a smartphone, and the smartphone is having a huge impact in even the poorest countries.
I said to my team, you know, what I see is a rise in aspirations all over the world.
In fact, it seems to me that there's a convergence of aspirations.
And I asked a team of economists to actually look into this. Is this true? Are aspirations converging all around the world?
So they looked at things like Gallup polls about satisfaction in life and what they learned was that if you have access to the internet, your satisfaction goes up.
But another thing happens that's very important: your reference income, the income to which you compare your own, also goes up.
Now, if the reference income of a nation, for example, goes up 10 percent by comparing themselves to the outside, then on average, people's own incomes have to go up at least five percent to maintain the same level of satisfaction.
But when you get down into the lower percentiles of income, your income has to go up much more if the reference income goes up 10 percent, something like 20 percent.
And so with this rise of aspirations, the fundamental question is: Are we going to have a situation where aspirations are linked to opportunity and you get dynamism and economic growth, like that which happened in the country I was born in, in Korea?
Or are aspirations going to meet frustration?
This is a real concern, because between 2012 and 2015, terrorism incidents increased by 74 percent.
The number of deaths from terrorism went up 150 percent.
Right now, two billion people live in conditions of fragility, conflict, violence, and by 2030, more than 60 percent of the world's poor will live in these situations of fragility, conflict and violence.
And so what do we do about meeting these aspirations?
Are there new ways of thinking about how we can rise to meet these aspirations?
Because if we don't, I'm extremely worried.
Aspirations are rising as never before because of access to the internet.
Everyone knows how everyone else lives.
Has our ability to meet those aspirations risen as well?
And just to get at the details of this, I want to share with you my own personal story.
This is not my mother, but during the Korean War, my mother literally took her own sister, her younger sister, on her back, and walked at least part of the way to escape Seoul during the Korean War.
Now, through a series of miracles, my mother and father both got scholarships to go to New York City.
They actually met in New York City and got married in New York City.
My father, too, was a refugee.
At the age of 19, he left his family in the northern part of the country, escaped through the border and never saw his family again.
Now, when they were married and living in New York, my father was a waiter at Patricia Murphy's restaurant.
Their aspirations went up.
They understood what it was like to live in a place like New York City in the 1950s.
Well, my brother was born and they came back to Korea, and we had what I remember as kind of an idyllic life, but what was happening in Korea at that time was the country was one of the poorest in the world and there was political upheaval.
There were demonstrations just down the street from our house all the time, students protesting against the military government.
And at the time, the aspirations of the World Bank Group, the organization I lead now, were extremely low for Korea.
Their idea was that Korea would find it difficult without foreign aid to provide its people with more than the bare necessities of life.
So the situation is Korea is in a tough position, my parents have seen what life is like in the United States.
They got married there.
My brother was born there.
And they felt that in order to give us an opportunity to reach their aspirations for us, we had to go and come back to the United States.
Now, we came back. First we went to Dallas.
My father did his dental degree all over again.
And then we ended up moving to Iowa, of all places.
We grew up in Iowa.
And in Iowa, we went through the whole course.
I went to high school, I went to college.
And then one day, something that I'll never forget, my father picked me up after my sophomore year in college, and he was driving me home, and he said, "Jim, what are your aspirations? What do you want to study? What do you want to do?" And I said, "Dad," -- My mother actually was a philosopher, and had filled us with ideas about protest and social justice, and I said, "Dad, I'm going to study political science and philosophy, and I'm going to become part of a political movement." My father, the Korean dentist, slowly pulled the car over to the side of the road --
(Laughter)
He looked back at me, and he said, "Jim, you finish your medical residency, you can study anything you want."
(Laughter)
Now, I've told this story to a mostly Asian audience before. Nobody laughs. They just shake their head. Of course.
(Laughter)
So, tragically, my father died at a young age, 30 years ago at the age of 57, what happens to be how old I am right now, and when he died in the middle of my medical and graduate studies — You see, I actually got around it by doing medicine and anthropology.
I studied both of them in graduate school.
But then right about that time, I met these two people, Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.
And Paul and I were in the same program.
We were studying medicine and at the same time getting our PhD's in anthropology.
And we began to ask some pretty fundamental questions.
For people who have the great privilege of studying medicine and anthropology -- I had come from parents who were refugees.
Paul grew up literally in a bus in a swamp in Florida.
He liked to call himself "white trash." And so we had this opportunity and we said, what is it that we need to do?
Given our ridiculously elaborate educations, what is the nature of our responsibility to the world?
And we decided that we needed to start an organization.
It's called Partners in Health.
And by the way, there's a movie made about that.
(Applause)
There's a movie that was just a brilliant movie they made about it called "Bending the Arc." It launched at Sundance this past January.
Jeff Skoll is here.
Jeff is one of the ones who made it happen.
And we began to think about what it would take for us to actually have our aspirations reach the level of some of the poorest communities in the world.
This is my very first visit to Haiti in 1988, and in 1988, we elaborated a sort of mission statement, which is we are going to make a preferential option for the poor in health.
Now, it took us a long time, and we were graduate students in anthropology.
We were reading up one side of Marx and down the other. Habermas. Fernand Braudel. We were reading everything and we had to come to a conclusion of how are we going to structure our work?
So "O for the P," we called it, a preferential option for the poor.
The most important thing about a preferential option for the poor is what it's not.
It's not a preferential option for your own sense of heroism. It's not a preferential option for your own idea about how to lift the poor out of poverty. It's not a preferential option for your own organization.
And the hardest of all, it's not a preferential option for your poor.
It's a preferential option for the poor.
So what do you do? Well, Haiti, we started building -- Everyone told us, the cost-effective thing is just focus on vaccination and maybe a feeding program.
But what the Haitians wanted was a hospital. They wanted schools. They wanted to provide their children with the opportunities that they'd been hearing about from others, relatives, for example, who had gone to the United States.
They wanted the same kinds of opportunities as my parents did. I recognized them. And so that's what we did. We built hospitals. We provided education. And we did everything we could to try to give them opportunities.
Now, my experience really became intense at Partners in Health in this community, Carabayllo, in the northern slums of Lima, Peru.
And in this community, we started out by really just going to people's homes and talking to people, and we discovered an outbreak, an epidemic of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. This is Melquiades. Melquiades was a patient at that time, he was about 18 years old, and he had a very difficult form of drug-resistant tuberculosis.
All of the gurus in the world, the global health gurus, said it is not cost-effective to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.
It's too complicated.
It's too expensive.
You just can't do it. It can't be done. And in addition, they were getting angry at us, because the implication was if it could be done, we would have done it.
Who do you think you are?
And the people that we fought with were the World Health Organization and probably the organization we fought with most was the World Bank Group.
Now, we did everything we could to convince Melquiades to take his medicines, because it's really hard, and not once during the time of treatment did Melquiades's family ever say, "Hey, you know, Melquiades is just not cost-effective.
Why don't you go on and treat somebody else?"
(Laughter)
I hadn't seen Melquiades for about 10 years and when we had our annual meetings in Lima, Peru a couple of years ago, the filmmakers found him and here is us getting together.
(Applause)
He has become a bit of a media star because he goes to the film openings, and he knows how to work an audience now.
(Laughter)
But as soon as we won -- We did win. We won the argument.
You should treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis -- we heard the same arguments in the early 2000s about HIV.
All of the leading global health people in the world said it is impossible to treat HIV in poor countries.
Too expensive, too complicated, you can't do it.
Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment, it's actually easier.
And we were seeing patients like this. Joseph Jeune. Joseph Jeune also never mentioned that he was not cost-effective.
A few months of medicines, and this is what he looked like.
(Applause)
We call that the Lazarus Effect of HIV treatment.
Joseline came to us looking like this.
This is what she looked like a few months later.
(Applause)
Now, our argument, our battle, we thought, was with the organizations that kept saying it's not cost-effective.
We were saying, no, preferential option for the poor requires us to raise our aspirations to meet those of the poor for themselves.
And they said, well, that's a nice thought but it's just not cost-effective.
So in the nerdy way that we have operated Partners in Health, we wrote a book against, basically, the World Bank.
It says that because the World Bank has focused so much on just economic growth and said that governments have to shrink their budgets and reduce expenditures in health, education and social welfare -- we thought that was fundamentally wrong.
And we argued with the World Bank.
And then a crazy thing happened.
President Obama nominated me to be President of the World Bank.
(Applause)
Now, when I went to do the vetting process with President Obama's team, they had a copy of "Dying For Growth," and they had read every page.
And I said, "OK, that's it, right?
You guys are going to drop me?" He goes, "Oh, no, no, it's OK." And I was nominated, and I walked through the door of the World Bank Group in July of 2012, and that statement on the wall, "Our dream is a world free of poverty." A few months after that, we actually turned it into a goal: end extreme poverty by 2030, boost shared prosperity.
That's what we do now at the World Bank Group.
I feel like I have brought the preferential option for the poor to the World Bank Group.
(Applause)
But this is TED, and so I want to share with you some concerns, and then make a proposal.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, now, you guys know so much better than I do, but here's the thing that concerns me.
What we hear about is job loss. You've all heard that.
Our own data suggest to us that two thirds of all jobs, currently existing jobs in developing countries, will be lost because of automation.
Now, you've got to make up for those jobs.
Now, one of the ways to make up for those jobs is to turn community health workers into a formal labor force.
That's what we want to do.
(Applause)
We think the numbers will work out, that as health outcomes get better and as people have formal work, we're going to be able to train them with the soft-skills training that you add to it to become workers that will have a huge impact, and that may be the one area that grows the most.
But here's the other thing that bothers me: right now it seems pretty clear to me that the jobs of the future will be more digitally demanding, and there is a crisis in childhood stunting.
So these are photos from Charles Nelson, who shared these with us from Harvard Medical School.
And what these photos show on the one side, on the left side, is a three-month-old who has been stunted: not adequate nutrition, not adequate stimulation.
And on the other side, of course, is a normal child, and the normal child has all of these neuronal connections.
Now, the neuronal connections are important, because that is the definition of human capital.
Now, we know that we can reduce these rates.
We can reduce these rates of childhood stunting quickly, but if we don't, India, for example, with 38 percent childhood stunting, how are they going to compete in the economy of the future if 40 percent of their future workers cannot achieve educationally and certainly we worry about achieving economically in a way that will help the country as a whole grow. Now, what are we going to do?
78 trillion dollars is the size of the global economy.
8.55 trillion dollars are sitting in negative interest rate bonds.
That means that you give the German central bank your money and then you pay them to keep your money.
That's a negative interest rate bond.
24.4 trillion dollars in very low-earning government bonds.
And 8 trillion literally sitting in the hands of rich people under their very large mattresses.
What we are trying to do is now use our own tools -- and just to get nerdy for a second, we're talking about first-loss risk debt instruments, we're talking about derisking, blended finance, we're talking about political risk insurance, credit enhancement -- all these things that I've now learned at the World Bank Group that rich people use every single day to make themselves richer, but we haven't used aggressively enough on behalf of the poor to bring this capital in.
(Applause)
So does this work? Can you actually bring private-sector players into a country and really make things work?
Well, we've done it a couple of times.
This is Zambia, Scaling Solar.
It's a box-set solution from the World Bank where we come in and we do all the things you need to attract private-sector investors.
And in this case, Zambia went from having a cost of electricity at 25 cents a kilowatt-hour, and by just doing simple things, doing the auction, changing some policies, we were able to bring the cost down.
Lowest bid, 25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia?
The lowest bid was 4.7 cents a kilowatt-hour. It's possible.
(Applause)
But here's my proposal for you. This is from a group called Zipline, a cool company, and they literally are rocket scientists.
They figured out how to use drones in Rwanda.
This is me launching a drone in Rwanda that delivers blood anywhere in the country in less than an hour.
So we save lives, this program saved lives --
This program made money for Zipline and this program saved huge amounts of money for Rwanda.
That's what we need, and we need that from all of you.
I'm asking you, carve out a little bit of time in your brains to think about the technology that you work on, the companies that you start, the design that you do.
Think a little bit and work with us to see if we can come up with these kinds of extraordinary win-win solutions.
I'm going to leave you with one final story.
I was in Tanzania, and I was in a classroom.
This is me with a classroom of 11-year-olds.
And I asked them, as I always do, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" Two raised their hands and said, "I want to be President of the World Bank."
(Laughter)
And just like you, my own team and their teachers laughed.
But then I stopped them.
I said, "Look, I want to tell you a story.
When I was born in South Korea, this is what it looked like.
This is where I came from.
And when I was three years old, in preschool, I don't think that George David Woods, the President of the World Bank, if he had visited Korea on that day and come to my classroom, that he would have thought that the future President of the World Bank was sitting in that classroom.
Don't let anyone ever tell you that you cannot be President of the World Bank.
Now -- thank you.
(Applause)
Let me leave you with one thought. I came from a country that was the poorest in the world.
I'm President of the World Bank.
I cannot and I will not pull up the ladder behind me. This is urgent. Aspirations are going up. Everywhere aspirations are going up.
You folks in this room, work with us.
We know that we can find those Zipline-type solutions and help the poor leapfrog into a better world, but it won't happen until we work together.
The future "you" -- and especially for your children -- the future you will depend on how much care and compassion we bring to ensuring that the future "us" provides equality of opportunity for every child in the world.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Chris Anderson: You'd almost think people are surprised to hear a talk like this from the President of the World Bank.
It's kind of cool.
I'd encourage you to even be a little more specific on your proposal.
There's many investors, entrepreneurs in this room. How will you partner with them? What's your proposal?
Jim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdy for just a second.
CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely. JYK: So here's what we did.
Insurance companies never invest in developing country infrastructure, for example, because they can't take the risk.
They're holding money for people who pay for insurance.
So what we did was a Swedish International Development Association gave us a little bit of money, we went out and raised a little bit more money, a hundred million, and we took first loss, meaning if this thing goes bad, 10 percent of the loss we'll just eat, and the rest of you will be safe.
And that created a 90-percent chunk, tranche that was triple B, investment-grade, so the insurance companies invested.
So for us, what we're doing is taking our public money and using it to derisk specific instruments to bring people in from the outside.
So all of you who are sitting on trillions of dollars of cash, come to us. Right?
(Laughter)
CA: And what you're specifically looking for are investment proposals that create employment in the developing world.
JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely. So these will be, for example, in infrastructure that brings energy, builds roads, bridges, ports.
These kinds of things are necessary to create jobs, but also what we're saying is you may think that the technology you're working on or the business that you're working on may not have applications in the developing world, but look at Zipline.
And that Zipline thing didn't happen just because of the quality of the technology.
It was because they engaged with the Rwandans early and used artificial intelligence -- one thing, Rwanda has great broadband -- but these things fly completely on their own.
So we will help you do that.
We will make the introductions.
We will even provide financing. We will help you do that.
CA: How much capital is the World Bank willing to deploy to back those kinds of efforts?
JYK: Chris, you're always getting me to try to do something like this.
CA: I'm trying to get you in trouble.
JYK: So here's what we're going to do.
We have 25 billion a year that we're investing in poor countries, the poorest countries.
And as we invest over the next three years, 25 billion a year, we have got to think with you about how to use that money more effectively.
So I can't give you a specific number.
It depends on the quality of the ideas.
So bring us your ideas, and I don't think that financing is going to be the problem.
CA: All right, you heard it from the man himself.
Jim, thanks so much. JYK: Thank you. Thank you.
I visit the future for a living. Not just one future, but many possible futures, bringing back evidences from those futures for you to experience today. Like an archaeologist of the future.
Over the years, my many journeys have brought back things like a new species of synthetically engineered bees; a book named, "Pets as Protein;" a machine that makes you rich by trading your genetic data; a lamp powered by sugar; a computer for growing food.
OK, so I don't actually travel to different futures -- yet.
But my husband Jon and I spend a lot of time thinking and creating visions of different futures in our studio.
We are constantly looking out for weak signals, those murmurs of future potential.
Then we trace those threads of potential out into the future, asking: What might it feel like to live in this future?
What might we see, hear and even breathe?
Then we run experiments, build prototypes, make objects, bringing aspects of these futures to life, making them concrete and tangible so you can really feel the impact of those future possibilities here and now.
But this work is not about predictions. It's about creating tools -- tools that can help connect our present and our future selves so we become active participants in creating a future we want -- a future that works for all.
So how do we go about doing this? For a recent project called Drone Aviary, we were interested in exploring what it would mean to live with drones in our cities. Drones that have the power to see things we can't, to go places we can't and to do so with increasing autonomy.
But to understand the technology, getting our hands dirty was crucial.
So we built several different drones in our studio.
We gave them names, functions and then flew them -- but not without difficulty.
Things came loose, GPS signals glitched and drones crashed.
But it was through such experimentation that we could construct a very concrete and very experiential slice of one possible future.
So now, let's go to that future.
Let's imagine we are living in a city with drones like this one.
We call it The Nightwatchman.
It patrols the streets, often spotted in the evenings and at night.
Initially, many of us were annoyed by its low, dull hum.
But then, like everything else, we got used to it.
Now, what if you could see the world through its eyes?
See how it constantly logs every resident of our neighborhood; logging the kids who play football in the no-ballgame area and marking them as statutory nuisances.
(Laughter)
And then see how it disperses this other group, who are teenagers, with the threat of an autonomously issued injunction.
And then there's this giant floating disc called Madison.
Its glaring presence is so overpowering, I can't help but stare at it.
But if feels like each time I look at it, it knows a little more about me -- like it keeps flashing all these Brianair adverts at me, as if it knows about the holiday I'm planning.
I'm not sure if I find this mildly entertaining or just entirely invasive.
Back to the present. In creating this future, we learned a lot. Not just about how these machines work, but what it would feel like to live alongside them.
Whilst drones like Madison and Nightwatchman, in these particular forms, are not real yet, most elements of a drone future are in fact very real today.
For instance, facial recognition systems are everywhere -- in our phones, even in our thermostats and in cameras around our cities -- keeping a record of everything we do, whether it's an advertisement we glanced at or a protest we attended.
These things are here, and we often don't understand how they work, and what their consequences could be.
And we see this all around us.
This difficulty in even imagining how the consequences of our actions today will affect our future.
Last year, where I live, in the UK, there was a referendum where the people could vote for the UK to leave the EU or stay in the EU, popularly known as "Brexit." And soon after the results came out, a word began to surface called "Bregret" --
(Laughter)
describing people who chose to vote for Brexit as a protest, but without thinking through its potential consequences.
And this disconnect is evident in some of the simplest things.
Say you go out for a quick drink.
Then you decide you wouldn't mind a few more.
You know you'll wake up in the morning feeling awful, but you justify it by saying, "The other me in the future will deal with that." But as we find out in the morning, that future "you" is you.
When I was growing up in India in the late '70s and early '80s, there was a feeling that the future both needed to and could actually be planned.
I remember my parents had to plan for some of the simplest things.
When they wanted a telephone in our house, they needed to order it and then wait -- wait for nearly five years before it got installed in our house.
(Laughter)
And then if they wanted to call my grandparents who lived in another city, they needed to book something called a "trunk call," and then wait again, for hours or even days.
And then abruptly, the phone would ring at two in the morning, and all of us would jump out of our beds and gather round the phone, shrieking into it, discussing general well-being at two in the morning.
Today it can feel like things are happening too fast -- so fast, that it can become really difficult for us to form an understanding of our place in history.
It creates an overwhelming sense of uncertainty and anxiety, and so, we let the future just happen to us.
We don't connect with that future "us." We treat our future selves as a stranger, and the future as a foreign land.
It's not a foreign land; it's unfolding right in front of us, continually being shaped by our actions today.
We are that future, and so I believe fighting for a future we want is more urgent and necessary than ever before.
We have learned in our work that one of the most powerful means of effecting change is when people can directly, tangibly and emotionally experience some of the future consequences of their actions today.
Earlier this year, the government of the United Arab Emirates invited us to help them shape their country's energy strategy all the way up to 2050.
Based on the government's econometric data, we created this large city model, and visualized many possible futures on it.
As I was excitably taking a group of government officials and members of energy companies through one sustainable future on our model, one of the participants told me, "I cannot imagine that in the future people will stop driving cars and start using public transport." And then he said, "There's no way I can tell my own son to stop driving his car."
But we were prepared for this reaction.
Working with scientists in a chemistry lab in my home city in India, we had created approximate samples of what the air would be like in 2030 if our behavior stays the same.
And so, I walked the group over to this object that emits vapor from those air samples.
Just one whiff of the noxious polluted air from 2030 brought home the point that no amount of data can.
This is not the future you would want your children to inherit.
The next day, the government made a big announcement. They would be investing billions of dollars in renewables.
We don't know what part our future experiences played in this decision, but we know that they've changed their energy policy to mitigate such a scenario.
While something like air from the future is very effective and tangible, the trajectory from our present to a future consequence is not always so linear.
Even when a technology is developed with utopian ideals, the moment it leaves the laboratory and enters the world, it is subject to forces outside of the creators' control.
For one particular project, we investigated medical genomics: the technology of gathering and using people's genetic data to create personalized medicine.
We were asking: What are some of the unintended consequences of linking our genetics to health care?
To explore this question further, we created a fictional lawsuit, and brought it to life through 31 pieces of carefully crafted evidence.
So we built an illegal genetic clinic, a DIY carbon dioxide incubator, and even bought frozen mice on eBay.
So now let's go to that future where this lawsuit is unfolding, and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann.
Arnold is being prosecuted by this global giant biotech company called Dynamic Genetics, because they have evidence that Arnold has illegally inserted the company's patented genetic material into his body.
How on earth did Arnold manage to do that?
Well, it all started when Arnold was asked to submit a saliva sample in this spit kit to the NHI -- the UK's National Health Insurance service.
When Arnold received his health insurance bill, he was shocked and scared to see that his premiums had gone through the roof, beyond anything he or his family could ever afford.
The state's algorithm had scanned his genetic data and found the risk of a chronic health condition lurking in his DNA. And so Arnold had to start paying toward the potential costs of that future disease -- potential future disease from today.
In that moment of fear and panic, Arnold slipped through the city into the dark shadows of this illegal clinic for treatment -- a treatment that would modify his DNA so that the state's algorithm would no longer see him as a risk, and his insurance premiums would become affordable again.
But Arnold was caught. And the legal proceedings in the case Dynamic Genetics v. Mann began.
In bringing such a future to life, what was important to us was that people could actually touch, see and feel its potential, because such an immediate and close encounter provokes people to ask the right questions, questions like: What are the implications of living in a world where I'm judged on my genetics?
Or: Who might claim ownership to my genetic data, and what might they do with it?
If this feels even slightly out-there or farfetched, today there's a little-known bill being passed through the American congress known as HR 1313, Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act.
This bill proposes to amend the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, popularly known as GINA, and would allow employers to ask about family medical history and genetic data to all employees for the first time.
Those who refuse would face large penalties.
In the work I've shown so far, whether it was drones or genetic crimes, these stories describe troubling futures with the intention of helping us avoid those futures.
But what about what we can't avoid?
Today, especially with climate change, it looks like we are heading for trouble.
And so what we want to do now is to prepare for that future by developing tools and attitudes that can help us find hope -- hope that can inspire action.
Currently, we are running an experiment in our studio.
It's a work in progress.
Based on climate data projections, we are exploring a future where the Western world has moved from abundance to scarcity.
We imagine living in a future city with repeated flooding, periods with almost no food in supermarkets, economic instabilities, broken supply chains.
What can we do to not just survive, but prosper in such a world? What food can we eat?
To really step inside these questions, we are building this room in a flat in London from 2050. It's like a little time capsule that we reclaimed from the future.
We stripped it down to the bare minimum.
Everything we lovingly put in our homes, like flat-panel TVs, internet-connected fridges and artisanal furnishings all had to go.
And in its place, we're building food computers from abandoned, salvaged and repurposed materials, turning today's waste into tomorrow's dinner.
For instance, we've just finished building our first fully automated fogponics machine.
It uses the technique of fogponics -- so just fog as a nutrient, not even water or soil -- to grow things quickly.
At the moment, we have successfully grown tomatoes.
But we'll need more food than what we can grow in this small room.
So what else could we forage from the city? Insects? Pigeons? Foxes?
Earlier, we brought back air from the future.
This time we are bringing an entire room from the future, a room full of hope, tools and tactics to create positive action in hostile conditions.
Spending time in this room, a room that could be our own future home, makes the consequences of climate change and food insecurity much more immediate and tangible.
What we're learning through such experiments and our practice and the people we engage with is that creating concrete experiences can bridge the disconnect between today and tomorrow.
By putting ourselves into different possible futures, by becoming open and willing to embrace the uncertainty and discomfort that such an act can bring, we have the opportunity to imagine new possibilities.
We can find optimistic futures; we can find paths forward; we can move beyond hope into action.
It means we have the chance to change direction, a chance to have our voices heard, a chance to write ourselves into a future we want.
Other worlds are possible.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My name is Katrina Spade, and I grew up in a medical family where it was fairly normal to talk about death and dying at the dinner table.
But I didn't go into medicine like so many of my family members.
Instead, I went to architecture school to learn how to design.
And while I was there, I began to be curious about what would happen to my physical body after I died.
What would my nearest and dearest do with me?
So if the existence and the fact of your own mortality doesn't get you down, the state of our current funerary practices will.
Today, almost 50 percent of Americans choose conventional burial.
Conventional burial begins with embalming, where funeral staff drain bodily fluid and replace it with a mixture designed to preserve the corpse and give it a lifelike glow.
Then, as you know, bodies are buried in a casket in a concrete-lined grave in a cemetery.
All told, in US cemeteries, we bury enough metal to build a Golden Gate Bridge, enough wood to build 1,800 single family homes, and enough formaldehyde-laden embalming fluid to fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools.
In addition, cemeteries all over the world are reaching capacity.
Turns out, it doesn't really make good business sense to sell someone a piece of land for eternity.
(Laughter)
Whose idea was that?
In some places, you can't buy a plot no matter how much money you have.
As a result, cremation rates have risen fast.
In 1950, if you suggested your grandmother be incinerated after she died, you'd probably be kicked from the family deathbed.
But today, almost half of Americans choose cremation, citing simpler, cheaper and more ecological as reasons.
I used to think that cremation was a sustainable form of disposition, but just think about it for a second.
Cremation destroys the potential we have to give back to the earth after we've died.
It uses an energy-intensive process to turn bodies into ash, polluting the air and contributing to climate change.
All told, cremations in the US emit a staggering 600 million pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere annually.
The truly awful truth is that the very last thing that most of us will do on this earth is poison it.
It's like we've created, accepted and death-denied our way into a status quo that puts as much distance between ourselves and nature as is humanly possible.
Our modern funerary practices are designed to stave off the natural processes that happen to a body after death.
In other words, they're meant to prevent us from decomposing.
But the truth is that nature is really, really good at death.
We've all seen it.
When organic material dies in nature, microbes and bacteria break it down into nutrient-rich soil, completing the life cycle.
In nature, death creates life.
Back in architecture school, I was thinking about all this, and I set out on a plan to redesign death care.
Could I create a system that was beneficial to the earth and that used nature as a guide rather than something to be feared?
Something that was gentle to the planet?
That planet, after all, supports our living bodies our whole lives.
And while I was mulling this all over over the drawing board, the phone rang.
It was my friend Kate.
She was like, "Hey, have you heard about the farmers who are composting whole cows?" And I was like, "Mmmm."
(Laughter)
Turns out that farmers in agricultural institutions have been practicing something called livestock mortality composting for decades.
Mortality composting is where you take an animal high in nitrogen and cover it with co-composting materials that are high in carbon.
It's an aerobic process, so it requires oxygen, and it requires plenty of moisture as well.
In the most basic setup, a cow is covered with a few feet of wood chips, which are high in carbon, and left outside for nature, for breezes to provide oxygen and rain to provide moisture.
In about nine months, all that remains is a nutrient-rich compost.
The flesh has been decomposed entirely, as have the bones. I know.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) So I would definitely call myself a decomposition nerd, but I am far, far from a scientist, and one way you can tell this is true is that I have often called the process of composting "magic."
So basically, all we humans need to do is create the right environment for nature to do its job.
It's like the opposite of antibacterial soap.
Instead of fighting them, we welcome microbes and bacteria in with open arms.
These tiny, amazing creatures break down molecules into smaller molecules and atoms, which are then incorporated into new molecules.
In other words, that cow is transformed.
It's no longer a cow.
It's been cycled back into nature. See? Magic.
You can probably imagine the light bulb that went off in my head after I received that phone call.
I began designing a system based on the principles of livestock mortality composting that would take human beings and transform them into soil.
Fast-forward five years and the project has grown in ways I truly never could have imagined.
We've created a scalable, replicable non-profit urban model based on the science of livestock mortality composting that turns human beings into soil.
We've partnered and collaborated with experts in soil science, decomposition, alternative death care, law and architecture.
We've raised funds from foundations and individuals in order to design a prototype of this system, and we've heard from tens of thousands of people all over the world who want this option to be available. OK. In the next few years, it's our goal to build the first full-scale human composting facility right in the city of Seattle.
(Applause)
Imagine it, part public park, part funeral home, part memorial to the people we love, a place where we can reconnect with the cycles of nature and treat bodies with gentleness and respect.
The infrastructure is simple. Inside a vertical core, bodies and wood chips undergo accelerated natural decomposition, or composting, and are transformed into soil.
When someone dies, their body is taken to a human composting facility.
After wrapping the deceased in a simple shroud, friends and family carry the body to the top of the core, which contains the natural decomposition system.
During a laying in ceremony, they gently place the body into the core and cover it with wood chips.
This begins the gentle transformation from human to soil.
Over the next few weeks, the body decomposes naturally.
Microbes and bacteria break down carbon, then protein, to create a new substance, a rich, earthy soil.
This soil can then be used to grow new life.
Eventually, you could be a lemon tree.
(Applause)
Yeah, thank you.
(Applause)
Who's thinking about lemon meringue pie right now?
(Laughter)
A lemon drop? Something stronger?
So in addition to housing the core, these buildings will function to support the grieving by providing space for memorial services and end-of-life planning.
The potential for repurposing is huge.
Old churches and industrial warehouses can be converted into places where we create soil and honor life.
We want to bring back the aspect of ritual that's been diluted over the past hundred years as cremation rates have risen and religious affiliation has declined.
Our Seattle facility will function as a model for these places all over the world.
We've heard from communities in South Africa, Australia, the UK, Canada and beyond.
We're creating a design toolkit that will help others design and build facilities that will contain technical specifications and regulatory best practices.
We want to help individuals, organizations, and down the road, municipalities design and build facilities in their own cities.
The idea is that every one of these places should look and feel completely different with the same system inside.
They're really meant to be designed for the neighborhood in which they reside and the community which they serve.
The other idea is for supportive staff to be on hand to help families with the care and preparation of loved ones' bodies.
We're banishing practices that bewilder and disempower and creating a system that is beautiful and meaningful and transparent. We believe that access to ecological death care is a human right.
OK, so you know the old saying, if you can compost a cow, you can compost a human?
(Laughter)
Turns out, it's true.
Since 2014, we've been running a pilot project in the hills of North Carolina with the Forensic Anthropology Department at Western Carolina University.
Six donor bodies have been covered in wood chips, oxygen provided by breezes, microbes and bacteria doing their jobs.
This pilot program has allowed us to demonstrate that it's possible to harness the incredible power of natural decomposition to turn human bodies into soil, and we're working with other universities as well.
Soil scientists at Washington State University, the grad students, anyway, are working to compost teeth with amalgam fillings so that we can understand what happens to the mercury therein.
Next up, we'll be beginning experiments to determine what happens to chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals during the composting process, and whether additional remediation will be needed.
By the way, composting creates a great deal of heat, especially this particular type of composting.
One week after we began composting our fifth donor body, the temperature inside that mound of wood chips reached 158 degrees Fahrenheit.
Imagine harnessing that heat to create energy or comfort the grieving on a cold day.
The death care revolution has begun.
It's an exciting time to be alive.
(Applause) Thank you.
I remember when I first found out I was going to speak at a TED conference.
I ran across the hall to one of my classrooms to inform my students.
"Guess what, guys? I've been asked to give a TED Talk."
The reaction wasn't one I quite expected.
The whole room went silent.
"A TED Talk? You mean, like the one you made us watch on grit?
Or the one with the scientist that did this really awesome thing with robots?" Muhammad asked.
"Yes, just like that."
"But Coach, those people are really important and smart."
(Laughter)
"I know that."
"But Coach, why are you speaking?
You hate public speaking. "
"I do," I admitted, "But it's important that I speak about us, that I speak about your journeys, about my journey.
People need to know."
The students at the all-refugee school that I founded decided to end with some words of encouragement.
"Cool! It better be good, Coach."
(Laughter)
There are 65.3 million people who have been forcibly displaced from their homes because of war or persecution.
The largest number, 11 million, are from Syria.
33,952 people flee their homes daily.
The vast majority remain in refugee camps, whose conditions cannot be defined as humane under anyone's definition.
We are participating in the degradation of humans.
Never have we had numbers this high.
This is the highest number of refugees since World War II. Now, let me tell you why this issue is so important to me.
I am a Muslim. I've also spent the last 12 years of my life working with refugees.
Oh -- and I'm also gay.
It makes me really popular these days.
(Laughter)
But I am the daughter of a refugee.
My grandmother fled Syria in 1964 during the first Assad regime.
She was three months pregnant when she packed up a suitcase, piled in her five children and drove to neighboring Jordan, not knowing what the future held for her and her family.
My grandfather decided to stay, not believing it was that bad.
He followed her a month later, after his brothers were tortured and his factory was taken over by the government.
They rebuilt their lives starting from scratch and eventually became independently wealthy Jordanian citizens.
I was born in Jordan 11 years later.
It was really important to my grandmother for us to know our history and our journey.
I was eight years old when she took me to visit my first refugee camp.
I didn't understand why.
I didn't know why it was so important to her for us to go.
I remember walking into the camp holding her hand, and her saying, "Go play with the kids," while she visited with the women in the camp.
I didn't want to.
These kids weren't like me. They were poor. They lived in a camp. I refused. She knelt down beside me and firmly said, "Go.
And don't come back until you've played.
Don't ever think people are beneath you or that you have nothing to learn from others."
I reluctantly went. I never wanted to disappoint my grandmother.
I returned a few hours later, having spent some time playing soccer with the kids in the camp.
We walked out of the camp, and I was excitedly telling her what a great time I had and how fantastic the kids were.
"Haram!" I said in Arabic. "Poor them."
"Haram on us," she said, using the word's different meaning, that we were sinning. "Don't feel sorry for them; believe in them."
It wasn't until I left my country of origin for the United States that I realized the impact of her words.
After my college graduation, I applied for and was granted political asylum, based on being a member of a social group.
Some people may not realize this, but you can still get the death penalty in some countries for being gay.
I had to give up my Jordanian citizenship.
That was the hardest decision I've ever had to make, but I had no other choice.
The point is, when you find yourself choosing between home and survival, the question "Where are you from?" becomes very loaded.
A Syrian woman who I recently met at a refugee camp in Greece articulated it best, when she recalled the exact moment she realized she had to flee Aleppo.
"I looked out the window and there was nothing.
It was all rubble.
There were no stores, no streets, no schools. Everything was gone. I had been in my apartment for months, listening to bombs drop and watching people die.
But I always thought it would get better, that no one could force me to leave, no one could take my home away from me.
And I don't know why it was that morning, but when I looked outside, I realized if I didn't leave, my three young children would die.
And so we left.
We left because we had to, not because we wanted to.
There was no choice," she said.
It's kind of hard to believe that you belong when you don't have a home, when your country of origin rejects you because of fear or persecution, or the city that you grew up in is completely destroyed.
I didn't feel like I had a home.
I was no longer a Jordanian citizen, but I wasn't American, either.
I felt a kind of loneliness that is still hard to put into words today.
After college, I desperately needed to find a place to call home.
I bounced around from state to state and eventually ended up in North Carolina.
Kindhearted people who felt sorry for me offered to pay rent or buy me a meal or a suit for my new interview.
It just made me feel more isolated and incapable.
It wasn't until I met Miss Sarah, a Southern Baptist who took me in at my lowest and gave me a job, that I started to believe in myself.
Miss Sarah owned a diner in the mountains of North Carolina.
I assumed, because of my privileged upbringing and my Seven Sister education, that she would ask me to manage the restaurant. I was wrong. I started off washing dishes, cleaning toilets and working the grill.
I was humbled; I was shown the value of hard work.
But most importantly, I felt valued and embraced.
I celebrated Christmas with her family, and she attempted to observe Ramadan with me.
I remember being very nervous about coming out to her -- after all, she was a Southern Baptist.
I sat on the couch next to her and I said, "Miss Sarah, you know that I'm gay." Her response is one that I will never forget.
"That's fine, honey.
Just don't be a slut. "
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I eventually moved to Atlanta, still trying to find my home.
My journey took a strange turn three years later, after I met a group of refugee kids playing soccer outside.
I'd made a wrong turn into this apartment complex, and I saw these kids outside playing soccer.
They were playing barefoot with a raggedy soccer ball and rocks set up as goals.
I watched them for about an hour, and after that I was smiling.
The boys reminded me of home. They reminded me of the way I grew up playing soccer in the streets of Jordan, with my brothers and cousins.
I eventually joined their game.
They were a little skeptical about letting me join it, because according to them, girls don't know how to play.
But obviously I did.
I asked them if they had ever played on a team.
They said they hadn't, but that they would love to.
I gradually won them over, and we formed our first team.
This group of kids would give me a crash course in refugees, poverty and humanity.
Three brothers from Afghanistan -- Roohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah -- played a major role in that.
I showed up late to practice one day to find the field completely deserted. I was really worried.
My team loved to practice.
It wasn't like them to miss practice.
I got out of my car, and two kids ran out from behind a dumpster, waving their hands frantically.
"Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped. There was blood everywhere."
"What do you mean?
What do you mean he got beat up? "
"These bad kids came and beat him up, Coach. Everybody left. They were all scared."
We hopped into my car and drove over to Rooh's apartment.
I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it. "Where's Rooh?
I need to talk to him, see if he's OK. "" He's in his room, Coach.
He's refusing to come out. "I knocked on the door.
"Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you.
I need to see if you're OK or if we need to go to the hospital."
He came out. He had a big gash on his head, a split lip, and he was physically shaken.
I was looking at him, and I asked the boys to call for their mom, because I needed to go to the hospital with him.
They called for their mom. She came out. I had my back turned to her, and she started screaming in Farsi.
The boys fell to the ground laughing.
I was very confused, because there was nothing funny about this.
They explained to me that she said,
"You told me your coach was a Muslim and a woman." From behind, I didn't appear to be either to her.
(Laughter)
"I am Muslim," I said, turning to her. "Ašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾilla (A) llāh," reciting the Muslim declaration of faith.
Confused, and perhaps maybe a little bit reassured, she realized that yes, I, this American-acting, shorts-wearing, non-veiled woman, was indeed a Muslim.
Their family had fled the Taliban.
Hundreds of people in their village were murdered.
Their father was taken in by the Taliban, only to return a few months later, a shell of the man he once was.
The family escaped to Pakistan, and the two older boys, age eight and 10 at the time, wove rugs for 10 hours a day to provide for their family.
They were so excited when they found out that they had been approved to resettle in the United States, making them the lucky 0.1 percent who get to do that.
They had hit the jackpot.
Their story is not unique.
Every refugee family I have worked with has had some version of this.
I work with kids who have seen their mothers raped, their fathers' fingers sliced off.
One kid saw a bullet put in his grandmother's head, because she refused to let the rebels take him to be a child soldier.
Their journeys are haunting.
But what I get to see every day is hope, resilience, determination, a love of life and appreciation for being able to rebuild their lives.
I was at the boys' apartment one night, when the mom came home after cleaning 18 hotel rooms in one day.
She sat down, and Noor rubbed her feet, saying that he was going to take care of her once he graduated.
She smiled from exhaustion. "God is good. Life is good. We are lucky to be here."
In the last two years, we have seen an escalating anti-refugee sentiment. It's global. The numbers continue to grow because we do nothing to prevent it and nothing to stop it.
The issue shouldn't be stopping refugees from coming into our countries.
The issue should be not forcing them to leave their own.
(Applause)
Sorry.
(Applause)
How much more suffering, how much more suffering must we take?
How many more people need to be forced out of their homes before we say, "Enough!"? A hundred million? Not only do we shame, blame and reject them for atrocities that they had absolutely nothing to do with, we re-traumatize them, when we're supposed to be welcoming them into our countries.
We strip them of their dignity and treat them like criminals.
I had a student in my office a couple of weeks ago.
She's originally from Iraq.
She broke down crying.
"Why do they hate us?"
"Who hates you?"
"Everyone; everyone hates us because we are refugees, because we are Muslim."
In the past, I was able to reassure my students that the majority of the world does not hate refugees.
But this time I couldn't.
I couldn't explain to her why someone tried to rip off her mother's hijab when they were grocery shopping, or why a player on an opposing team called her a terrorist and told her to go back where she came from.
I couldn't reassure her that her father's ultimate life sacrifice by serving in the United States military as an interpreter would make her more valued as an American citizen.
We take in so few refugees worldwide.
We resettle less than 0.1 percent.
That 0.1 percent benefits us more than them.
It dumbfounds me how the word "refugee" is considered something to be dirty, something to be ashamed of.
They have nothing to be ashamed of.
We have seen advances in every aspect of our lives -- except our humanity.
There are 65.3 million people who have been forced out of their homes because of war -- the largest number in history.
We are the ones who should be ashamed.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to give you a new perspective.
That sounds grandiose, and it is.
I left Ireland yesterday morning.
I traveled from Dublin to New York independently.
But the design of an airport, plane and terminal offers little independence when you're 105 and a half centimeters tall.
For Americans, that's 3' 5".
I was whisked through the airport by airline assistants in a wheelchair.
Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair, but the design of an airport and its lack of accessibility means that it's my only way to get through.
With my carry-on bag between my feet, I was wheeled through security, preclearance and I arrived at my boarding gate.
I use the accessibility services in the airport because most of the terminal is just not designed with me in mind.
Take security, for example.
I'm not strong enough to lift my carry-on bag from the ground to the carousel.
I stand at eye level with it.
And those who work in that space for safety purposes cannot help me and cannot do it for me.
Design inhibits my autonomy and my independence.
But traveling at this size, it isn't all bad.
The leg room in economy is like business class.
(Laughter)
I often forget that I'm a little person.
It's the physical environment and society that remind me.
Using a public bathroom is an excruciating experience.
I walk into the cubicle but I can't reach the lock on the door.
I'm creative and resilient.
I look around and see if there's a bin that I can turn upside down. Is it safe? Not really. Is it hygienic and sanitary? Definitely not. But the alternative is much worse.
If that doesn't work, I use my phone.
It gives me an additional four- to six-inch reach, and I try to jam the lock closed with my iPhone.
Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive had in mind when he designed the iPhone, but it works.
The alternative is that I approach a stranger.
I apologize profusely and I ask them to stand guard outside my cubicle door.
They do and I emerge grateful but absolutely mortified, and hope that they didn't notice that I left the bathroom without washing my hands.
I carry hand sanitizer with me every single day because the sink, soap dispenser, hand dryer and mirror are all out of my reach.
Now, the accessible bathroom is somewhat of an option.
In this space, I can reach the lock on the door, the sink, the soap dispenser, the hand dryer and the mirror.
Yet, I cannot use the toilet.
It is deliberately designed higher so that wheelchair users can transfer across with ease.
This is a wonderful and necessary innovation, but in the design world, when we describe a new project or idea as accessible, what does that mean?
Who is it accessible to?
And whose needs are not being accommodated for?
Now, the bathroom is an example of where design impinges upon my dignity, but the physical environment impacts upon me in much more casual ways too, something as simple as ordering a cup of coffee.
Now, I'll admit it. I drink far too much coffee.
My order is a skinny vanilla latte, but I'm trying to wean myself off the syrup.
But the coffee shop, it's not designed well, at least not for me.
Queuing, I'm standing beside the pastry cabinet and the barista calls for the next order. "Next, please!" they shout.
They can't see me.
The person next to me in the queue points to my existence and everyone is embarrassed.
I order as quick as I can and I move along to collect my coffee. Now, think just for a second. Where do they put it? Up high and without a lid.
Reaching up to collect a coffee that I have paid for is an incredibly dangerous experience.
But design also impinges on the clothes that I want to wear.
I want garments that reflect my personality.
It's difficult to find in the childrenswear department.
And often womenswear requires far too many alterations.
I want shoes that affect my maturity, professionalism and sophistication.
Instead, I'm offered sneakers with Velcro straps and light-up shoes.
Now, I'm not totally opposed to light-up shoes.
(Laughter)
But design also impacts on such simple things, like sitting on a chair.
I cannot go from a standing to a seating position with grace.
Due to the standards of design heights of chairs, I have to crawl on my hands and knees just to get on top of it, whilst also being conscious that it might tip over at any stage.
But whilst design impacts on me whether it's a chair, a bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes, I rely on and benefit from the kindness of strangers.
But not everybody is so nice.
I'm reminded that I'm a little person when a stranger points, stares, laughs, calls me a name, or takes a photograph of me.
This happens almost every day.
With the rise of social media, it has given me an opportunity and a platform to have a voice as a blogger and as an activist, but it has also made me nervous that I might become a meme or a viral sensation, all without my consent.
So let's take a moment right now to make something very clear.
The word "midget" is a slur.
It evolved from PT Barnum's era of circuses and freak shows. Society has evolved. So should our vocabulary.
Language is a powerful tool.
It does not just name our society. It shapes it.
I am incredibly proud to be a little person, to have inherited the condition of achondroplasia.
But I am most proud to be Sinead.
Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism.
Achondroplasia translates as "without cartilage formation." I have short limbs and achondroplastic facial features, my forehead and my nose.
My arms do not straighten fully, but I can lick my elbow.
I'm not showing you that one.
Achondroplasia occurs in approximately one in every 20,000 births.
80 percent of little people are born to two average-height parents.
That means that anybody in this room could have a child with achondroplasia.
Yet, I inherited my condition from my dad.
I'd like to show you a photo of my family.
My mother is average height, my father is a little person and I am the eldest of five children.
I have three sisters and one brother.
They are all average height.
I am incredibly fortunate to have been born into a family that cultivated my curiosity and my tenacity, that protected me from the unkindness and ignorance of strangers and that armed me with the resilience, creativity and confidence that I needed to survive and manipulate the physical environment and society.
If I was to pinpoint any reason why I am successful, it is because I was and I am a loved child, now, a loved child with a lot of sass and sarcasm, but a loved child nonetheless.
In giving you an insight into who I am today I wanted to offer you a new perspective.
I wanted to challenge the idea that design is but a tool to create function and beauty.
Design greatly impacts upon people's lives, all lives.
Design is a way in which we can feel included in the world, but it is also a way in which we can uphold a person's dignity and their human rights.
Design can also inflict vulnerability on a group whose needs aren't considered.
So today, I want your perceptions challenged. Who are we not designing for? How can we amplify their voices and their experiences?
What is the next step?
Design is an enormous privilege, but it is a bigger responsibility.
I want you to open your eyes.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
"These are the times," said Thomas Paine, "that try men's souls." And they're trying ours now.
This is a fateful moment in the history of the West.
We've seen divisive elections and divided societies.
We've seen a growth of extremism in politics and religion, all of it fueled by anxiety, uncertainty and fear, of a world that's changing almost faster than we can bear, and the sure knowledge that it's going to change faster still.
I have a friend in Washington.
I asked him, what was it like being in America during the recent presidential election? He said to me, "Well, it was like the man sitting on the deck of the Titanic with a glass of whiskey in his hand and he's saying, 'I know I asked for ice --
(Laughter)
but this is ridiculous.'"
So is there something we can do, each of us, to be able to face the future without fear?
I think there is.
And one way into it is to see that perhaps the most simple way into a culture and into an age is to ask: What do people worship? People have worshipped so many different things -- the sun, the stars, the storm.
Some people worship many gods, some one, some none.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, people worshipped the nation, the Aryan race, the communist state. What do we worship? I think future anthropologists will take a look at the books we read on self-help, self-realization, self-esteem.
They'll look at the way we talk about morality as being true to oneself, the way we talk about politics as a matter of individual rights, and they'll look at this wonderful new religious ritual we have created. You know the one?
Called the "selfie." And I think they'll conclude that what we worship in our time is the self, the me, the I.
And this is great. It's liberating. It's empowering. It's wonderful. But don't forget that biologically, we're social animals.
We've spent most of our evolutionary history in small groups.
We need those face-to-face interactions where we learn the choreography of altruism and where we create those spiritual goods like friendship and trust and loyalty and love that redeem our solitude.
When we have too much of the "I" and too little of the "we," we can find ourselves vulnerable, fearful and alone.
It was no accident that Sherry Turkle of MIT called the book she wrote on the impact of social media "Alone Together."
So I think the simplest way of safeguarding the future "you" is to strengthen the future "us" in three dimensions: the us of relationship, the us of identity and the us of responsibility.
So let me first take the us of relationship.
And here, forgive me if I get personal.
Once upon a time, a very long time ago, I was a 20-year-old undergraduate studying philosophy.
I was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauer and Sartre and Camus.
I was full of ontological uncertainty and existential angst. It was terrific.
(Laughter)
I was self-obsessed and thoroughly unpleasant to know, until one day I saw across the courtyard a girl who was everything that I wasn't. She radiated sunshine. She emanated joy. I found out her name was Elaine. We met. We talked. We married. And 47 years, three children and eight grandchildren later, I can safely say it was the best decision I ever took in my life, because it's the people not like us that make us grow.
And that is why I think we have to do just that.
The trouble with Google filters, Facebook friends and reading the news by narrowcasting rather than broadcasting means that we're surrounded almost entirely by people like us whose views, whose opinions, whose prejudices, even, are just like ours.
And Cass Sunstein of Harvard has shown that if we surround ourselves with people with the same views as us, we get more extreme.
I think we need to renew those face-to-face encounters with the people not like us.
I think we need to do that in order to realize that we can disagree strongly and yet still stay friends.
It's in those face-to-face encounters that we discover that the people not like us are just people, like us.
And actually, every time we hold out the hand of friendship to somebody not like us, whose class or creed or color are different from ours, we heal one of the fractures of our wounded world.
That is the us of relationship.
Second is the us of identity.
Let me give you a thought experiment.
Have you been to Washington?
Have you seen the memorials? Absolutely fascinating. There's the Lincoln Memorial: Gettysburg Address on one side, Second Inaugural on the other.
You go to the Jefferson Memorial, screeds of text.
Martin Luther King Memorial, more than a dozen quotes from his speeches.
I didn't realize, in America you read memorials.
Now go to the equivalent in London in Parliament Square and you will see that the monument to David Lloyd George contains three words: David Lloyd George.
(Laughter)
Nelson Mandela gets two. Churchill gets just one: Churchill.
(Laughter)
Why the difference? I'll tell you why the difference.
Because America was from the outset a nation of wave after wave of immigrants, so it had to create an identity which it did by telling a story which you learned at school, you read on memorials and you heard repeated in presidential inaugural addresses.
Britain until recently wasn't a nation of immigrants, so it could take identity for granted.
The trouble is now that two things have happened which shouldn't have happened together.
The first thing is in the West we've stopped telling this story of who we are and why, even in America.
And at the same time, immigration is higher than it's ever been before.
So when you tell a story and your identity is strong, you can welcome the stranger, but when you stop telling the story, your identity gets weak and you feel threatened by the stranger.
And that's bad.
I tell you, Jews have been scattered and dispersed and exiled for 2,000 years. We never lost our identity. Why? Because at least once a year, on the festival of Passover, we told our story and we taught it to our children and we ate the unleavened bread of affliction and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery.
So we never lost our identity.
I think collectively we've got to get back to telling our story, who we are, where we came from, what ideals by which we live.
And if that happens, we will become strong enough to welcome the stranger and say, "Come and share our lives, share our stories, share our aspirations and dreams." That is the us of identity.
And finally, the us of responsibility. Do you know something? My favorite phrase in all of politics, very American phrase, is: "We the people." Why "we the people?" Because it says that we all share collective responsibility for our collective future.
And that's how things really are and should be.
Have you noticed how magical thinking has taken over our politics?
So we say, all you've got to do is elect this strong leader and he or she will solve all our problems for us.
Believe me, that is magical thinking.
And then we get the extremes: the far right, the far left, the extreme religious and the extreme anti-religious, the far right dreaming of a golden age that never was, the far left dreaming of a utopia that never will be and the religious and anti-religious equally convinced that all it takes is God or the absence of God to save us from ourselves.
That, too, is magical thinking, because the only people who will save us from ourselves is we the people, all of us together.
And when we do that, and when we move from the politics of me to the politics of all of us together, we rediscover those beautiful, counterintuitive truths: that a nation is strong when it cares for the weak, that it becomes rich when it cares for the poor, it becomes invulnerable when it cares about the vulnerable.
That is what makes great nations.
(Applause)
So here is my simple suggestion. It might just change your life, and it might just help to begin to change the world.
Do a search and replace operation on the text of your mind, and wherever you encounter the word "self," substitute the word "other." So instead of self-help, other-help; instead of self-esteem, other-esteem.
And if you do that, you will begin to feel the power of what for me is one of the most moving sentences in all of religious literature. "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me." We can face any future without fear so long as we know we will not face it alone.
So for the sake of the future "you," together let us strengthen the future "us."
Thank you.
(Applause)
All right, let's get up our picture of the earth.
The earth is pretty awesome.
I'm a geologist, so I get pretty psyched about this, but the earth is great. It's powerful, it's dynamic, it's constantly changing.
It's a pretty exciting place to live.
But I want to share with you guys today my perspective as a geologist in how understanding earth's past can help inform and guide decisions that we make today about how to sustainably live on earth's surface.
So there's a lot of exciting things that go on on the surface of the earth.
If we zoom in here a little bit, I want to talk to you guys a little bit about one of the things that happens.
Material get shuffled around earth's surface all the time, and one of the big thing that happens is material from high mountains gets eroded and transported and deposited in the sea.
And this process is ongoing all the time, and it has huge effects on how the landscape works. So this example here in south India -- we have some of the biggest mountains in the world, and you can see in this satellite photo rivers transporting material from those mountains out to the sea.
You can think of these rivers like bulldozers.
They're basically taking these mountains and pushing them down towards the sea.
We'll give you guys an example here.
So we zoom in a little bit.
I want to talk to you guys specifically about a river.
We can see these beautiful patterns that the rivers make as they're pushing material down to the sea, but these patterns aren't static.
These rivers are wiggling and jumping around quite a bit, and it can have big impacts on our lives.
So an example of this is this is the Kosi River.
So the Kosi River has this nice c-shaped pathway, and it exits the big mountains of Nepal carrying with it a ton of material, a lot of sediments that's being eroded from the high mountains, and it spreads out across India and moves this material.
So we're going to zoom in to this area and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what happened with the Kosi.
It's an example of how dynamic these systems can be.
So this is a satellite image from August of 2008, and this satellite image is colored so that vegetations or plants show up as green and water shows up as blue.
So here again you can see that c-shaped pathway that this river takes as it exits Nepal.
And now this is monsoon season.
August is monsoon season in this region of the world, and anyone that lives near a river is no stranger to flooding and the hazards and inconveniences at minimum that are associated with that.
But something interesting happened in 2008, and this river moved in a way that's very different.
It flooded in a way that's very different than it normally does.
So the Kosi River is flowing down here, but sometimes as these rivers are bulldozing sediment, they kind of get clogged, and these clogs can actually cause the rivers to shift their course dramatically.
So this satellite image is from just two weeks later.
Here's the previous pathway, that c-shaped pathway, and you notice it's not blue anymore.
But now what we have is this blue pathway that cuts down the middle of the field of view here.
What happened is the Kosi River jumped its banks, and for reference, the scale bar here is 40 miles.
This river moved over 30 miles very abruptly.
So this river got clogged and it jumped its banks.
Here's an image from about a week later, and you can see these are the previous pathways, and you can see this process of river-jumping continues as this river moves farther away from its major course.
So you can imagine in landscapes like this, where rivers move around frequently, it's really important to understand when, where and how they're going to jump.
But these kinds of processes also happen a lot closer to home as well.
So in the United States, we have the Mississippi River that drains most of the continental US.
It pushes material from the Rocky Mountains and from the Great Plains. It drains it and moves it all the way across America and dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico.
So this is the course of the Mississippi that we're familiar with today, but it didn't always flow in this direction.
If we use the geologic record, we can reconstruct where it went in the past.
So for example, this red area here is where we know the Mississippi River flowed and deposited material about 4,600 years ago.
Then about 3,500 years ago it moved to follow the course outlined here in orange.
And it kept moving and it keeps moving.
So here's about 2,000 years ago, a thousand years ago, 700 years ago. And it was only as recently as 500 years ago that it occupied the pathway that we're familiar with today.
So these processes are really important, and especially here, this delta area, where these river-jumping events in the Mississippi are building land at the interface of the land and the sea. This is really valuable real estate, and deltas like this are some of the most densely populated areas on our planet. So understanding the dynamics of these landscapes, how they formed and how they will continue to change in the future is really important for the people that live there.
So rivers also wiggle. These are sort of bigger jumps that we've been talking about.
I want to show you guys some river wiggles here.
So we're going to fly down to the Amazon River basin, and here again we have a big river system that is draining and moving and plowing material from the Andean Mountains, transporting it across South America and dumping it out into the Atlantic Ocean.
So if we zoom in here, you guys can see these nice, curvy river pathways.
Again, they're really beautiful, but again, they're not static. These rivers wiggle around. We can use satellite imagery over the last 30 or so years to actually monitor how these change.
So take a minute and just watch any bend or curve in this river, and you'll see it doesn't stay in the same place for very long.
It changes and evolves and warps its pattern.
If you look in this area in particular, I want you guys to notice there's a sort of a loop in the river that gets completely cut off.
It's almost like a whip cracking and snaps off the pathway of the river at a certain spot.
So just for reference, again, in this location, that river changed its course over four miles over the course of a season or two.
So the landscapes that we live in on earth, as this material is being eroded from the mountains and transported to the sea, are wiggling around all the time. They're changing all the time, and we need to be able to understand these processes so we can manage and live sustainably on these landscapes.
But it's hard to do if the only information we have is what's going on today at earth's surface. Right? We don't have a lot of observations.
We only have 30 years' worth of satellite photos, for example.
We need more observations to understand these processes more.
And additionally, we need to know how these landscapes are going to respond to changing climate and to changing land use as we continue to occupy and modify earth's surface.
So this is where the rocks come in.
So as rivers flow, as they're bulldozing material from the mountains to the sea, sometimes bits of sand and clay and rock get stuck in the ground.
And that stuff that gets stuck in the ground gets buried, and through time, we get big, thick accumulations of sediments that eventually turn into rocks.
What this means is that we can go to places like this, where we see big, thick stacks of sedimentary rocks, and go back in time and see what the landscapes looked like in the past.
We can do this to help reconstruct and understand how earth landscapes evolve.
This is pretty convenient, too, because the earth has had sort of an epic history. Right? So this video here is a reconstruction of paleogeography for just the first 600 million years of earth's history.
So just a little bit of time here.
So as the plates move around, we know climate has changed, sea level has changed, we have a lot of different types of landscapes and different types of environments that we can go back -- if we have a time machine -- we can go back and look at, and we do indeed have a time machine because we can look at the rocks that were deposited at these times.
So I'm going to give you an example of this and take you to a special time in earth's past.
About 55 million years ago, there was a really abrupt warming event, and what happened was a whole bunch of carbon dioxide was released into earth's atmosphere, and it caused a rapid and pretty extreme global warming event.
And when I say warm, I mean pretty warm, that there were things like crocodiles and palm trees as far north as Canada and as far south as Patagonia.
So this was a pretty warm time and it happened really abruptly.
So what we can do is we can go back and find rocks that were deposited at this time and reconstruct how the landscape changed in response to this warming event.
So here, yay, rocks.
(Laughter)
Here's a pile of rocks. This yellow blob here, this is actually a fossil river, so just like this cartoon I showed, these are deposits that were laid down 55 million years ago.
As geologists, we can go and look at these up close and reconstruct the landscape.
So here's another example.
The yellow blob here is a fossil river.
Here's another one above it.
We can go and look in detail and make measurements and observations, and we can measure features.
For example, the features I just highlighted there tell us that this particular river was probably about three feet deep.
You could wade across this cute little stream if you were walking around 55 million years ago.
The reddish stuff that's above and below those channels, those are ancient soil deposits.
So we can look at those to tell us what lived and grew on the landscape and to understand how these rivers were interacting with their floodplains.
So we can look in detail and reconstruct with some specificity how these rivers flowed and what the landscapes looked like.
So when we do this for this particular place at this time, if we look what happened before this abrupt warming event, the rivers kind of carved their way down from the mountains to the sea, and they looked maybe similar to what I showed you in the Amazon River basin.
But right at the onset of this climate change event, the rivers change dramatically.
All of a sudden they got much broader, and they started to slide back and forth across the landscape more readily.
Eventually, the rivers reverted back to a state that was more similar to what they would have looked like before this climate event, but it took a long, long time.
So we can go back in earth's time and do these kinds of reconstructions and understand how earth's landscape has changed in response to a climate event like this or a land use event.
So some of the ways that rivers change or the reasons that rivers change their pattern and their movements is because of things like with extra water falling on the land's surface when climate is hotter, we can move more sediment and erode more sediment, and that changes how rivers behave.
So ultimately, as long as earth's surface is our home, we need to carefully manage the resources and risks associated with living in dynamic environments.
And I think the only way we can really do that sustainably is if we include information about how landscapes evolved and behaved in earth's past.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, a few years ago I heard an interesting rumor.
Apparently, the head of a large pet food company would go into the annual shareholder's meeting with can of dog food.
And he would eat the can of dog food.
And this was his way of convincing them that if it was good enough for him, it was good enough for their pets.
This strategy is now known as "dogfooding," and it's a common strategy in the business world.
It doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food, but businesspeople will use their own products to demonstrate that they feel -- that they're confident in them.
Now, this is a widespread practice, but I think what's really interesting is when you find exceptions to this rule, when you find cases of businesses or people in businesses who don't use their own products.
Turns out there's one industry where this happens in a common way, in a pretty regular way, and that is the screen-based tech industry.
So, in 2010, Steve Jobs, when he was releasing the iPad, described the iPad as a device that was "extraordinary." "The best browsing experience you've ever had; way better than a laptop, way better than a smartphone.
It's an incredible experience." A couple of months later, he was approached by a journalist from the New York Times, and they had a long phone call.
At the end of the call, the journalist threw in a question that seemed like a sort of softball.
He said to him, "Your kids must love the iPad." There's an obvious answer to this, but what Jobs said really staggered the journalist.
He was very surprised, because he said, "They haven't used it.
We limit how much technology our kids use at home."
This is a very common thing in the tech world.
In fact, there's a school quite near Silicon Valley called the Waldorf School of the Peninsula, and they don't introduce screens until the eighth grade.
What's really interesting about the school is that 75 percent of the kids who go there have parents who are high-level Silicon Valley tech execs.
So when I heard about this, I thought it was interesting and surprising, and it pushed me to consider what screens were doing to me and to my family and the people I loved, and to people at large.
So for the last five years, as a professor of business and psychology, I've been studying the effect of screens on our lives.
And I want to start by just focusing on how much time they take from us, and then we can talk about what that time looks like.
What I'm showing you here is the average 24-hour workday at three different points in history: 2007 -- 10 years ago -- 2015 and then data that I collected, actually, only last week.
And a lot of things haven't changed all that much.
We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half to eight hours a day; some people say that's declined slightly, but it hasn't changed much.
We work eight-and-a-half to nine hours a day.
We engage in survival activities -- these are things like eating and bathing and looking after kids -- about three hours a day.
That leaves this white space.
That's our personal time.
That space is incredibly important to us.
That's the space where we do things that make us individuals.
That's where hobbies happen, where we have close relationships, where we really think about our lives, where we get creative, where we zoom back and try to work out whether our lives have been meaningful.
We get some of that from work as well, but when people look back on their lives and wonder what their lives have been like at the end of their lives, you look at the last things they say -- they are talking about those moments that happen in that white personal space.
So it's sacred; it's important to us.
Now, what I'm going to do is show you how much of that space is taken up by screens across time.
In 2007, this much.
That was the year that Apple introduced the first iPhone.
this much. Eight years later, Now, this much. That's how much time we spend of that free time in front of our screens.
This yellow area, this thin sliver, is where the magic happens.
That's where your humanity lives.
And right now, it's in a very small box.
So what do we do about this? Well, the first question is: What does that red space look like?
Now, of course, screens are miraculous in a lot of ways.
I live in New York, a lot of my family lives in Australia, and I have a one-year-old son.
The way I've been able to introduce them to him is with screens.
I couldn't have done that 15 or 20 years ago in quite the same way.
So there's a lot of good that comes from them.
One thing you can do is ask yourself: What goes on during that time?
How enriching are the apps that we're using? And some are enriching. If you stop people while they're using them and say, "Tell us how you feel right now," they say they feel pretty good about these apps -- those that focus on relaxation, exercise, weather, reading, education and health.
They spend an average of nine minutes a day on each of these.
These apps make them much less happy.
About half the people, when you interrupt them and say, "How do you feel?" say they don't feel good about using them.
What's interesting about these -- dating, social networking, gaming, entertainment, news, web browsing -- people spend 27 minutes a day on each of these.
We're spending three times longer on the apps that don't make us happy.
That doesn't seem very wise.
One of the reasons we spend so much time on these apps that make us unhappy is they rob us of stopping cues. Stopping cues were everywhere in the 20th century.
They were baked into everything we did.
A stopping cue is basically a signal that it's time to move on, to do something new, to do something different.
And -- think about newspapers; eventually you get to the end, you fold the newspaper away, you put it aside.
The same with magazines, books -- you get to the end of a chapter, prompts you to consider whether you want to continue.
You watched a show on TV, eventually the show would end, and then you'd have a week until the next one came.
There were stopping cues everywhere.
But the way we consume media today is such that there are no stopping cues.
The news feed just rolls on, and everything's bottomless: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, email, text messaging, the news.
And when you do check all sorts of other sources, you can just keep going on and on and on.
So, we can get a cue about what to do from Western Europe, where they seem to have a number of pretty good ideas in the workplace.
Here's one example. This is a Dutch design firm.
And what they've done is rigged the desks to the ceiling.
And at 6pm every day, it doesn't matter who you're emailing or what you're doing, the desks rise to the ceiling.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Four days a week, the space turns into a yoga studio, one day a week, into a dance club.
It's really up to you which ones you stick around for.
But this is a great stopping rule, because it means at the end of the day, everything stops, there's no way to work.
At Daimler, the German car company, they've got another great strategy.
When you go on vacation, instead of saying, "This person's on vacation, they'll get back to you eventually," they say, "This person's on vacation, so we've deleted your email.
This person will never see the email you just sent."
(Laughter)
"You can email back in a couple of weeks, or you can email someone else."
(Laughter)
And so --
(Applause)
You can imagine what that's like.
You go on vacation, and you're actually on vacation.
The people who work at this company feel that they actually get a break from work.
But of course, that doesn't tell us much about what we should do at home in our own lives, so I want to make some suggestions.
It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm, I'm going to not use my phone.
The problem is, 5 and 6pm looks different on different days.
I think a far better strategy is to say, I do certain things every day, there are certain occasions that happen every day, like eating dinner.
Sometimes I'll be alone, sometimes with other people, sometimes in a restaurant, sometimes at home, but the rule that I've adopted is: I will never use my phone at the table.
It's far away, as far away as possible.
Because we're really bad at resisting temptation.
But when you have a stopping cue that, every time dinner begins, my phone goes far away, you avoid temptation all together.
At first, it hurts.
I had massive FOMO.
(Laughter)
I struggled.
But what happens is, you get used to it.
You overcome the withdrawal the same way you would from a drug, and what happens is, life becomes more colorful, richer, more interesting -- you have better conversations.
You really connect with the people who are there with you.
I think it's a fantastic strategy, and we know it works, because when people do this -- and I've tracked a lot of people who have tried this -- it expands.
They feel so good about it, they start doing it for the first hour of the day in the morning.
They start putting their phones on airplane mode on the weekend.
That way, your phone remains a camera, but it's no longer a phone.
It's a really powerful idea, and we know people feel much better about their lives when they do this.
So what's the take home here? Screens are miraculous; I've already said that, and I feel that it's true.
But the way we use them is a lot like driving down a really fast, long road, and you're in a car where the accelerator is mashed to the floor, it's kind of hard to reach the brake pedal.
You've got a choice.
You can either glide by, past, say, the beautiful ocean scenes and take snaps out the window -- that's the easy thing to do -- or you can go out of your way to move the car to the side of the road, to push that brake pedal, to get out, take off your shoes and socks, take a couple of steps onto the sand, feel what the sand feels like under your feet, walk to the ocean, and let the ocean lap at your ankles.
Your life will be richer and more meaningful because you breathe in that experience, and because you've left your phone in the car.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I am a climate scientist, and I hate weather.
I have spent too much time in California, and I strongly feel that weather should be optional.
(Laughter)
So I don't want to experience clouds, let alone study them.
But clouds seem to follow me wherever I go.
The thing is, clouds are a real challenge for climate science.
We don't know how they're going to react as the planet heats up, and hidden in that uncertainty might be hope.
Maybe, just maybe, clouds could slow down global warming, and buy us a little bit more time to get our act together, which would be very convenient right now.
I mean, even I could put up with a few more cloudy days if clouds saved the planet.
Now, we are sure about some things.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, we're emitting a lot of it, and the planet is heating up. Case closed. But I still go to work every day.
It turns out that there is a lot that we don't understand about climate change.
In particular, we haven't answered what seems to be a very fundamental question.
We know it's going to get hot, but we don't know exactly how hot it's going to get.
Now, this is a really easy question to answer if one of you would like to give me a time machine.
But I'm going to be honest with you: if I had a time machine, I would not be hanging out at this particular point in history.
So in order to see the future, we have to rely on the output of computer simulations -- climate models, like this one.
Now, in my line of work, I encounter many very charming people on the internet who like to tell me that climate models are all wrong.
And I would just like to say: no kidding! Seriously? I get paid to complain about climate models.
But we don't want models to be perfect.
We want them to be useful.
I mean, think about it: a computer simulation that's able to exactly reproduce all of reality.
That's not a climate model; That's "The Matrix." So, models are not crystal balls.
They're research tools, and the ways in which they're wrong can actually teach us a lot.
For example: different climate models are largely able to capture the warming that we've seen so far.
But fast-forward to the end of the century under a business-as-usual scenario, and climate models don't really agree anymore.
Yeah, they're all warming; that's just basic physics.
But some of them project catastrophe -- more than five times the warming we've seen already.
And others are literally more chill.
So why don't climate models agree on how warm it's going to get?
Well, to a large extent, it's because they don't agree on what clouds will do in the future.
And that is because, just like me, computers hate clouds.
Computers hate clouds because they're simultaneously very large and very small.
Clouds are formed when microscopic water droplets or ice crystals coalesce around tiny particles.
But at the same time, they cover two-thirds of the earth's surface.
In order to really accurately model clouds, we'd need to track the behavior of every water droplet and dust grain in the entire atmosphere, and there's no computer powerful enough to do that.
So instead, we have to make a trade-off: we can zoom in and get the details right, but have no idea what's going on worldwide; or, we could sacrifice realism at small scales in order to see the bigger picture.
Now, there's no one right answer, no perfect way to do this, and different climate models make different choices.
Now, it is unfortunate that computers struggle with clouds, because clouds are crucially important in regulating the temperature of the planet.
In fact, if all the clouds went away, we would experience profound climate changes.
But without clouds, would it be warmer or colder?
The answer is both.
So I'm going to be honest with you, I am not a cloud spotter.
My favorite type of cloud is none.
But even I know that clouds come in all shapes and sizes.
Low, thick clouds like these are really good at blocking out the sun and ruining your barbecue, and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus largely let that sunlight stream through.
Every sunny day is the same, but every cloudy day is cloudy in its own way.
And it's this diversity that can make the global impact of clouds very hard to understand.
So to see this global effect of clouds, it really helps to take a selfie.
It will never cease to blow my mind that we can see our planet from outer space, but we can't see all of it.
Clouds are blocking the view.
That's what they do.
These low, thick clouds are extremely effective sunshades.
They turn back about 20 percent of everything the sun sends us.
That is a lot of wasted solar power.
So, low clouds are powerful sunshades, making the planet cooler.
But that's not the only effect of clouds.
Our planet has a temperature, and like anything with a temperature, it's giving off heat.
We are radiating thermal energy away into space, and we can see this in the infrared.
Once again, clouds are blocking the view.
That's because high clouds live in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, where it's very cold.
And this means that they lose very little heat to space themselves.
But at the same time, they block the heat coming up from the planet below.
The earth is trying to cool itself off, and high clouds are getting in the way.
The result is a very powerful greenhouse effect.
So, clouds play this very large and dual role in the climate system.
We've got low clouds that act like a sunshade, cooling the planet, and high clouds which act like a greenhouse, warming the planet.
Right now, these two effects -- they don't cancel out.
That sunshade -- it's a little bit more powerful.
So if we got rid of all the clouds tomorrow, which, for the record, I am not advocating, our planet would get warmer.
So clearly, all of the clouds are not going away.
But climate change is change.
So we can ask: How will global warming change clouds?
But remember, clouds are so important in regulating the earth's temperature, and they both warm and cool the planet.
So even small changes to cloud cover could have profound consequences.
So we might also ask: How will clouds change global warming?
And that is where there might be space for hope.
If global warming triggers cloud changes that make for a less powerful greenhouse or a more effective sunshade, then that would enhance the cooling power of clouds.
It would act in opposition to global warming, and that's what's happening in those climate models that project relatively muted warming.
But climate models struggle with clouds, and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways.
Clouds could help us out with global warming.
They could also make it worse.
Now, we know that climate change is happening because we can see it: rising temperatures, melting icecaps, shifts in rainfall patterns.
And you might think that we could also see it in the clouds.
But here's something else unfortunate: clouds are really hard to see.
I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest is like, "I have some suggestions for you."
(Laughter)
And you guys, we have tried looking up.
(Laughter)
But in order to do climate science, we need to see all of the clouds, everywhere, for a very long time.
And that's what makes it hard.
Now, nothing sees more clouds than a satellite -- not even a British person.
(Laughter)
And fortunately, we do have satellite observations of clouds that, like me, date back to the 1980s.
But these satellites were designed for weather, not climate.
They weren't in it for the long haul.
So to get that long-term trend information, we need to do climate science.
We have to stitch together the output of multiple satellites with different viewing angles and orbits and carrying different camera equipment.
And as a result, there are gaps in our knowledge.
But even from this very cloudy picture, we're starting to get hints of a possible future.
When we looked at the observations, one thing jumped out at us: the clouds are moving.
As the planet's temperature increases, high clouds rise up.
They move to the colder upper reaches of the atmosphere, and this means that even as the planet heats up, high clouds don't.
They remain at roughly the same temperature.
So they are not losing more heat to space.
But at the same time, they're trapping more heat from the warming planet below.
This intensifies the greenhouse effect.
High clouds are making global warming worse.
Clouds are moving in other dimensions, too.
The atmospheric circulation, that large-scale motion of air and water in the atmosphere, is changing, and clouds are going with it.
On large scales, clouds seem to be moving from the tropics toward the poles.
It's kind of like your grandparents in reverse.
And this matters, because if your job is to block incoming sunlight, you are going to be much more effective in the tropics under that intense tropical sun than you are in higher latitudes.
So if this keeps up, this will also make global warming worse.
And what we have not found, despite years of looking, is any indication of the opposite.
There is no observational evidence that clouds will substantially slow down global warming.
The earth is not going to break its own fever.
Now, there are still uncertainties here.
We don't know for sure what the future holds.
But we are sending our kids there, and they are never coming back.
I want them to be prepared for what they'll face, and that is why it is so important to keep our earth-observing satellites up there and to hire diverse and smart and talented people who do not hate clouds to improve the climate models.
But uncertainty is not ignorance.
We don't know everything, but we don't know nothing, and we know what carbon dioxide does.
I started my career as an astrophysicist, so you can believe me when I say that this is the greatest place in the universe.
Other planets might have liquid water.
On earth, we have whiskey.
(Laughter)
We are so lucky to live here, but let's not push our luck.
I don't think that clouds will save the planet.
I think that's probably up to us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life, I ceased to exist.
I was having a small operation, and my brain was filling with anesthetic.
I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart and a coldness.
And then I was back, drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there.
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now.
Coming round from anesthesia is very different.
I could have been under for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years.
I simply wasn't there.
It was total oblivion.
Anesthesia -- it's a modern kind of magic.
It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people.
And in this process is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy.
How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience.
And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience right here and right now. How does this happen?
Answering this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is.
Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all.
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through mental illness or pain.
And if we can experience joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too?
Do they also have a sense of self?
And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point, maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops a sense of its own existence.
I actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote.
And I think this because my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms.
Consciousness and intelligence are very different things.
You don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive.
In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through and because of our living bodies.
Now, you might have heard that we know nothing about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.
Some people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether.
But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area.
If you come to my lab at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers.
All of us together trying to understand how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong.
And the strategy is very simple.
I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've come to think about life.
At one time, people thought the property of being alive could not be explained by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be more than just mechanism.
But people no longer think that.
As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is started to fade away, and people didn't propose any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital.
So as with life, so with consciousness.
Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is should start to fade away.
At least that's the plan. So let's get started.
What are the properties of consciousness?
What should a science of consciousness try to explain?
Well, for today I'd just like to think of consciousness in two different ways.
There are experiences of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie.
And then there's conscious self.
The specific experience of being you or being me.
The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly.
Let's start with experiences of the world around us, and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine.
Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure what's out there in the world.
There's no lights inside the skull. There's no sound either.
All you've got to go on is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related to things in the world, whatever they may be.
So perception -- figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is to form its best guess of what caused those signals.
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.
What we perceive is its best guess of what's out there in the world.
Let me give you a couple of examples of all this.
You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think about it in a new way.
If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be very different shades of gray, right?
But they are in fact exactly the same shade.
And I can illustrate this.
If I put up a second version of the image here and join the two patches with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference.
It's exactly the same shade of gray.
And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across and join them up.
It's a single colored block of gray, there's no difference at all.
This isn't any kind of magic trick.
It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again, and it looks different.
So what's happening here is that the brain is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter than it really is.
Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience.
Have a listen to this.
(Distorted voice)
Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again and see if you can get anything.
(Distorted voice)
Still strange. Now listen to this.
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit is a really terrible idea.
(Laughter)
Which I do.
So you heard some words there, right?
Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it.
(Distorted voice)
Yeah? So you can now hear words there.
Once more for luck.
(Distorted voice)
OK, so what's going on here?
The remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all.
All that's changed is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information.
And that changes what you consciously hear.
All this puts the brain basis of perception in a bit of a different light.
Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction.
We don't just passively perceive the world, we actively generate it.
The world we experience comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in.
Let me give you one more example of perception as this active, constructive process.
Here we've combined immersive virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience.
In this panoramic video, we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground.
to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions We've processed the footage using an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream
In this case, to see dogs.
And you can see this is a very strange thing.
When perceptual predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis.
Now, think about this for a minute.
If hallucination is a kind of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions are being reigned in by sensory information from the world.
In fact, we're all hall ucinating all the time, including right now.
It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations, we call that reality.
(Laughter)
Now I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain.
This seems a very strange idea, right?
Yes, visual illusions might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived about what it means to be me?
For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified and so continuous that it's difficult not to take it for granted.
But we shouldn't take it for granted.
There are in fact many different ways we experience being a self.
There's the experience of having a body and of being a body.
There are experiences of perceiving the world from a first person point of view.
There are experiences of intending to do things and of being the cause of things that happen in the world.
And there are experiences of being a continuous and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set of memories and social interactions.
Many experiments show, and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well, that these different ways in which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain.
Another experience, which just like all others, requires explanation.
So let's return to the bodily self.
How does the brain generate the experience of being a body and of having a body?
Well, just the same principles apply.
The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not part of its body.
And there's a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this.
And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home.
All you need is one of these.
(Laughter)
And a couple of paintbrushes.
In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them.
Then both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand.
Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand is in fact part of their body.
And the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess that the fake hand is in fact part of the body.
(Laughter)
So you can measure all kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance and startle responses, but there's no need.
It's clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences of what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled hallucination by the brain.
There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within.
We all experience the sense of being a body from the inside.
And sensory signals coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing, what the blood pressure is like, lots of things.
This kind of perception, which we call interoception, is rather overlooked.
But it's critically important because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive.
Here's another version of the rubber hand illusion.
This is from our lab at Sussex.
And here, people see a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time with their heartbeat.
And when it's flashing in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense that it's in fact part of their body.
So experiences of having a body are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within.
There's one last thing I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us.
When I look around me, the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it as an object from the outside.
But my experiences of the body from within, they're not like that at all.
I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere.
I don't perceive my insides as objects.
In fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong.
And this is important, I think.
Perception of the internal state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival.
When the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there, we perceive objects as the causes of sensations.
When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things, we experience how well or how badly that control is going.
So our most basic experiences of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
And when we follow this idea all the way through, we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic drive to stay alive.
We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of our living bodies.
Let me bring things together step-by-step.
What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess of what's out there.
Our experienced world comes from the inside out, not just the outside in.
The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body.
And these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body.
And finally, experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there.
So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity.
We predict ourselves into existence.
Now, I leave you with three implications of all this.
First, just as we can misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong.
Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like depression and schizophrenia.
Second: what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated.
We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.
Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient.
Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible way of being conscious.
And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses.
Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures.
Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science, from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day.
With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of and not apart from the rest of nature.
And... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all.
Thank you.

In ancient Greece, when anyone from slaves to soldiers, poets and politicians, needed to make a big decision on life's most important questions, like, "Should I get married?" or "Should we embark on this voyage?" or "Should our army advance into this territory?" they all consulted the oracle.
So this is how it worked: you would bring her a question and you would get on your knees, and then she would go into this trance.
It would take a couple of days, and then eventually she would come out of it, giving you her predictions as your answer.
From the oracle bones of ancient China to ancient Greece to Mayan calendars, people have craved for prophecy in order to find out what's going to happen next.
And that's because we all want to make the right decision.
We don't want to miss something.
The future is scary, so it's much nicer knowing that we can make a decision with some assurance of the outcome.
Well, we have a new oracle, and it's name is big data, or we call it "Watson" or "deep learning" or "neural net." And these are the kinds of questions we ask of our oracle now, like, "What's the most efficient way to ship these phones from China to Sweden?" Or, "What are the odds of my child being born with a genetic disorder?" Or, "What are the sales volume we can predict for this product?"
I have a dog. Her name is Elle, and she hates the rain.
And I have tried everything to untrain her.
But because I have failed at this, I also have to consult an oracle, called Dark Sky, every time before we go on a walk, for very accurate weather predictions in the next 10 minutes.
She's so sweet.
So because of all of this, our oracle is a $122 billion industry.
Now, despite the size of this industry, the returns are surprisingly low.
Investing in big data is easy, but using it is hard.
Over 73 percent of big data projects aren't even profitable, and I have executives coming up to me saying, "We're experiencing the same thing.
We invested in some big data system, and our employees aren't making better decisions. And they're certainly not coming up with more breakthrough ideas."
So this is all really interesting to me, because I'm a technology ethnographer.
I study and I advise companies on the patterns of how people use technology, and one of my interest areas is data.
So why is having more data not helping us make better decisions, especially for companies who have all these resources to invest in these big data systems?
Why isn't it getting any easier for them?
So, I've witnessed the struggle firsthand.
In 2009, I started a research position with Nokia.
And at the time, Nokia was one of the largest cell phone companies in the world, dominating emerging markets like China, Mexico and India -- all places where I had done a lot of research on how low-income people use technology.
And I spent a lot of extra time in China getting to know the informal economy.
So I did things like working as a street vendor selling dumplings to construction workers.
Or I did fieldwork, spending nights and days in internet cafés, hanging out with Chinese youth, so I could understand how they were using games and mobile phones and using it between moving from the rural areas to the cities.
Through all of this qualitative evidence that I was gathering, I was starting to see so clearly that a big change was about to happen among low-income Chinese people.
Even though they were surrounded by advertisements for luxury products like fancy toilets -- who wouldn't want one? -- and apartments and cars, through my conversations with them, I found out that the ads the actually enticed them the most were the ones for iPhones, promising them this entry into this high-tech life.
And even when I was living with them in urban slums like this one, I saw people investing over half of their monthly income into buying a phone, and increasingly, they were "shanzhai," which are affordable knock-offs of iPhones and other brands.
They're very usable. Does the job.
And after years of living with migrants and working with them and just really doing everything that they were doing, I started piecing all these data points together -- from the things that seem random, like me selling dumplings, to the things that were more obvious, like tracking how much they were spending on their cell phone bills.
And I was able to create this much more holistic picture of what was happening.
And that's when I started to realize that even the poorest in China would want a smartphone, and that they would do almost anything to get their hands on one.
You have to keep in mind, iPhones had just come out, it was 2009, so this was, like, eight years ago, and Androids had just started looking like iPhones.
And a lot of very smart and realistic people said, "Those smartphones -- that's just a fad.
Who wants to carry around these heavy things where batteries drain quickly and they break every time you drop them?" But I had a lot of data, and I was very confident about my insights, so I was very excited to share them with Nokia.
But Nokia was not convinced, because it wasn't big data.
They said, "We have millions of data points, and we don't see any indicators of anyone wanting to buy a smartphone, and your data set of 100, as diverse as it is, is too weak for us to even take seriously." And I said, "Nokia, you're right.
Of course you wouldn't see this, because you're sending out surveys assuming that people don't know what a smartphone is, so of course you're not going to get any data back about people wanting to buy a smartphone in two years.
Your surveys, your methods have been designed to optimize an existing business model, and I'm looking at these emergent human dynamics that haven't happened yet.
We're looking outside of market dynamics so that we can get ahead of it." Well, you know what happened to Nokia?
Their business fell off a cliff.
This -- this is the cost of missing something. It was unfathomable. But Nokia's not alone.
I see organizations throwing out data all the time because it didn't come from a quant model or it doesn't fit in one.
But it's not big data's fault.
It's the way we use big data; it's our responsibility.
Big data's reputation for success comes from quantifying very specific environments, like electricity power grids or delivery logistics or genetic code, when we're quantifying in systems that are more or less contained.
But not all systems are as neatly contained.
When you're quantifying and systems are more dynamic, especially systems that involve human beings, forces are complex and unpredictable, and these are things that we don't know how to model so well.
Once you predict something about human behavior, new factors emerge, because conditions are constantly changing.
That's why it's a never-ending cycle.
You think you know something, and then something unknown enters the picture.
And that's why just relying on big data alone increases the chance that we'll miss something, while giving us this illusion that we already know everything.
And what makes it really hard to see this paradox and even wrap our brains around it is that we have this thing that I call the quantification bias, which is the unconscious belief of valuing the measurable over the immeasurable.
And we often experience this at our work. Maybe we work alongside colleagues who are like this, or even our whole entire company may be like this, where people become so fixated on that number, that they can't see anything outside of it, even when you present them evidence right in front of their face.
And this is a very appealing message, because there's nothing wrong with quantifying; it's actually very satisfying.
I get a great sense of comfort from looking at an Excel spreadsheet, even very simple ones. (Laughter)
It's just kind of like, "Yes! The formula worked. It's all OK.
Everything is under control. "
But the problem is that quantifying is addictive.
And when we forget that and when we don't have something to kind of keep that in check, it's very easy to just throw out data because it can't be expressed as a numerical value. It's very easy just to slip into silver-bullet thinking, as if some simple solution existed.
Because this is a great moment of danger for any organization, because oftentimes, the future we need to predict -- it isn't in that haystack, but it's that tornado that's bearing down on us outside of the barn.
There is no greater risk than being blind to the unknown.
It can cause you to make the wrong decisions. It can cause you to miss something big.
But we don't have to go down this path.
It turns out that the oracle of ancient Greece holds the secret key that shows us the path forward.
Now, recent geological research has shown that the Temple of Apollo, where the most famous oracle sat, was actually built over two earthquake faults.
(Laughter) And these faults would release these petrochemical fumes from underneath the Earth's crust, and the oracle literally sat right above these faults, inhaling enormous amounts of ethylene gas, these fissures.
It's true.
(Laughter) It's all true, and that's what made her babble and hallucinate and go into this trance-like state.
She was high as a kite!
(Laughter)
So how did anyone -- How did anyone get any useful advice out of her in this state?
Well, you see those people surrounding the oracle?
You see those people holding her up, because she's, like, a little woozy?
And you see that guy on your left-hand side holding the orange notebook?
Well, those were the temple guides, and they worked hand in hand with the oracle.
When inquisitors would come and get on their knees, that's when the temple guides would get to work, because after they asked her questions, they would observe their emotional state, and then they would ask them follow-up questions, like, "Why do you want to know this prophecy? Who are you? What are you going to do with this information?" And then the temple guides would take this more ethnographic, this more qualitative information, and interpret the oracle's babblings.
So the oracle didn't stand alone, and neither should our big data systems.
Now to be clear, I'm not saying that big data systems are huffing ethylene gas, or that they're even giving invalid predictions. The total opposite. But what I am saying is that in the same way that the oracle needed her temple guides, our big data systems need them, too.
They need people like ethnographers and user researchers who can gather what I call thick data.
This is precious data from humans, like stories, emotions and interactions that cannot be quantified.
It's the kind of data that I collected for Nokia that comes in in the form of a very small sample size, but delivers incredible depth of meaning.
And what makes it so thick and meaty is the experience of understanding the human narrative.
And that's what helps to see what's missing in our models.
Thick data grounds our business questions in human questions, and that's why integrating big and thick data forms a more complete picture.
Big data is able to offer insights at scale and leverage the best of machine intelligence, whereas thick data can help us rescue the context loss that comes from making big data usable, and leverage the best of human intelligence.
And when you actually integrate the two, that's when things get really fun, because then you're no longer just working with data you've already collected. You get to also work with data that hasn't been collected.
You get to ask questions about why: Why is this happening?
Now, when Netflix did this, they unlocked a whole new way to transform their business.
Netflix is known for their really great recommendation algorithm, and they had this $1 million prize for anyone who could improve it.
And there were winners. But Netflix discovered the improvements were only incremental.
So to really find out what was going on, they hired an ethnographer, Grant McCracken, to gather thick data insights. And what he discovered was something that they hadn't seen initially in the quantitative data.
He discovered that people loved to binge-watch.
In fact, people didn't even feel guilty about it. They enjoyed it.
(Laughter) So Netflix was like, "Oh.
This is a new insight. "So they went to their data science team, and they were able to scale this big data insight in with their quantitative data.
And once they verified it and validated it, Netflix decided to do something very simple but impactful.
They said, instead of offering the same show from different genres or more of the different shows from similar users, we'll just offer more of the same show.
We'll make it easier for you to binge-watch. And they didn't stop there. They did all these things to redesign their entire viewer experience, to really encourage binge-watching.
It's why people and friends disappear for whole weekends at a time, catching up on shows like "Master of None." By integrating big data and thick data, they not only improved their business, but they transformed how we consume media.
And now their stocks are projected to double in the next few years.
But this isn't just about watching more videos or selling more smartphones.
For some, integrating thick data insights into the algorithm could mean life or death, especially for the marginalized.
All around the country, police departments are using big data for predictive policing, to set bond amounts and sentencing recommendations in ways that reinforce existing biases.
NSA's Skynet machine learning algorithm has possibly aided in the deaths of thousands of civilians in Pakistan from misreading cellular device metadata.
As all of our lives become more automated, from automobiles to health insurance or to employment, it is likely that all of us will be impacted by the quantification bias.
Now, the good news is that we've come a long way from huffing ethylene gas to make predictions.
We have better tools, so let's just use them better.
Let's integrate the big data with the thick data.
Let's bring our temple guides with the oracles, and whether this work happens in companies or nonprofits or government or even in the software, all of it matters, because that means we're collectively committed to making better data, better algorithms, better outputs and better decisions.
This is how we'll avoid missing that something.
(Applause)
If you've been thinking about US politics and trying to make sense of it for the last year or so, you might have hit on something like the following three propositions: one, US partisanship has never been so bad before; two, for the first time, it's geographically spatialized — we're divided between the coasts, which want to look outwards, and the center of the country, which wants to look inwards; and third, there's nothing we can do about it.
I'm here to today to say that all three of these propositions, all of which sound reasonable, are not true.
In fact, our US partisanship goes all the way back to the very beginning of the republic.
It was geographically spatialized in almost eerily the same way that it is today, and it often has been throughout US history.
And last, and by far most importantly, we actually have an extraordinary mechanism that's designed to help us manage factional disagreement and partisanship.
That technology is the Constitution.
And this is an evolving, subtly, supplely designed entity that has the specific purpose of teaching us how to manage factional disagreement where it's possible to do that, and giving us techniques for overcoming that disagreement when that's possible.
Now, in order to tell you the story, I want to go back to a pivotal moment in US history, and that is the moment when factional disagreement and partisanship was born.
There actually was a birth moment -- a moment in US history when partisanship snapped into place.
The person who's at the core of that story is James Madison.
And at the moment that this began, James Madison was riding high.
He himself was the Einstein of not only the US Constitution, but of constitutional thought more globally, and, to give him his due, he knew it.
In a period of time of just three years, from 1785 to 1788, he had conceived, theorized, designed, passed and gotten ratified the US Constitution.
And just to give you some sense of the enormity of what that accomplishment actually was, although Madison couldn't have known it at the time, today that same constitutional technology that he invented is still in use not only in the US, but, 230 years later, in places like Canada, India, South Africa, Brazil.
So in an extraordinary range of contexts all over the world, this technology is still the dominant, most used, most effective technology to manage governance.
In that moment, Madison believed that, having solved this problem, the country would run smoothly, and that he had designed a technology that would minimize the results of factions so there would be no political parties.
Remarkably, he thought he had designed a constitution that was against political parties and would make them unnecessary.
He had gotten an enormous degree of help in the final marketing phase of his constitutional project from a man you may have heard of, called Alexander Hamilton.
Now, Hamilton was everything Madison was not.
He was passionate, where Madison was restrained.
He was pansexual, where Madison didn't speak to a woman expect for once until he was 42 years old, and then married Dolley and lived happily ever after for 40 years. (Laughter)
Or indeed, a musical of any kind at all. But together, they had become a rather unlikely pairing, and they had produced the Federalist Papers, which offered a justification and, as I mentioned, a marketing plan for the Constitution, which had been wildly effective and wildly successful.
Once the new government was in place, Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury, and he had a very specific idea in mind.
And that was to do for financial institutions and infrastructure exactly what Madison had done for constitutions.
Again, his contemporaries all knew it.
One of them told Madison, who can't have liked it very much, that Hamilton was the Newton of infrastructure.
The idea was pretty straightforward.
Hamilton would give the United States a national bank, a permanent national debt -- he said it would be "immortal," his phrase -- and a manufacturing policy that would enable trade and manufacturing rather than agriculture, which was where the country's primary wealth had historically been. Madison went utterly ballistic. And in this pivotal, critical decision, instead of just telling the world that his old friend Hamilton was wrong and was adopting the wrong policies, he actually began to argue that Hamilton's ideas were unconstitutional -- that they violated the very nature of the Constitution that the two of them had drafted together.
Hamilton responded the way you would expect.
He declared Madison to be his "personal and political enemy" -- these are his words.
So these two founders who had been such close friends and such close allies and such partners, then began to produce enmity.
And they did it in the good, old-fashioned way.
First, they founded political parties.
Madison created a party originally called the Democratic Republican Party -- "Republican" for short -- and Hamilton created a party called the Federalist Party.
Those two parties adopted positions on national politics that were extreme and exaggerated.
To give you a clear example: Madison, who had always believed that the country would have some manufacturing and some trade and some agriculture, began attacking Hamilton as a kind of tool of the financial markets whom Hamilton himself intended to put in charge of the country.
That was an overstatement, but it was something Madison came to believe.
He also attacked city life, and he said that the coasts were corrupt, and what people needed to do was to look inwards to the center of the country, to farmers, who were the essence of Republican virtue, and they should go back to the values that had made American great, specifically the values of the Revolution, and those were the values of low taxes, agriculture and less trade.
Hamilton responded to this by saying that Madison was naïve, that he was childish, and that his goal was to turn the United States into a primitive autarchy, self-reliant and completely ineffectual on the global scale. (Laughter) They both meant it, and there was some truth to each of their claims, because each side was grossly exaggerating the views of the other in order to fight their war.
They founded newspapers, and so for the first time in US history, the news that people received came entirely through the lens of either the Republican or the Federalist party.
How does this end? Well, as it turned out, the Constitution did its work.
But it did its work in surprising ways that Madison himself had not fully anticipated.
First, there was a series of elections.
And the first two times out of the box, the Federalists destroyed the Republicans. Madison was astonished. Of course, he blamed the press. (Laughter) And in a rather innovative view — Madison never failed to innovate when he thought about anything — he said the reason that the press was so pro-Federalist is that the advertisers were all Federalists, because they were traders on the coasts who got their capital from Britain, which Federalism was in bed with.
That was his initial explanation.
But despite the fact that the Federalists, once in power, actually enacted laws that criminalized criticism of the government — that happened in the United States — nevertheless, the Republicans fought back, and Madison began to emphasize the freedom of speech, which he had built into the Bill of Rights, and the capacity of civil society to organize.
And sure enough, nationally, small local groups -- they were called Democratic-Republican Societies -- began to form and protest against Federalist-dominated hegemony.
Eventually, the Republicans managed to win a national election -- that was in 1800.
Madison became the Secretary of State, his friend and mentor Jefferson became president, and they actually, over time, managed to put the Federalists completely out of business.
That was their goal. Now, why did that happen? It happened because in the structure of the Constitution were several features that actually managed faction the way there were supposed to do in the first place. What were those? One -- most important of all -- the freedom of speech.
This was an innovative idea at the time.
Namely, that if you were out of power, you could still say that the government was terrible.
Two, civil society organization.
The capacity to put together private groups, individuals, political parties and others who would organize to try to bring about fundamental change.
Perhaps most significantly was the separation of powers -- an extraordinary component of the Constitution.
The thing about the separation of powers is that it did then and it does now, drive governance to the center.
You can get elected to office in the United States with help from the periphery, right or left.
It turns out, you actually can't govern unless you bring on board the center.
There are midterm elections that come incredibly fast after a presidency begins.
Those drive presidents towards the center.
There's a structure in which the president, in fact, does not rule or even govern, but can only propose laws which other people have to agree with -- another feature that tends to drive presidents who actually want to get things done to the center.
And a glance at the newspapers today will reveal to you that these principles are still completely in operation.
No matter how a president gets elected, the president cannot get anything done unless the president first of all follows the rules of the Constitution, because if not, the courts will stand up, as indeed has sometimes occurred, not only recently, but in the past, in US history.
And furthermore, the president needs people, elected officials who know they need to win election from centrist voters, also to back his or her policies in order to pass laws.
Without it, nothing much happens.
The takeaway of this brief excursus into the history of partisanship, then, is the following: partisanship is real; it's profound; it's extraordinarily powerful, and it's terribly upsetting.
But the design of the Constitution is greater than partisanship.
It enables us to manage partisanship when that's possible, and it enables us actually to overcome partisan division and produce compromise, when and only when that is possible.
A technology like that is a technology that worked for the founders, it worked for their grandchildren, it didn't work at the moment of the Civil War, but then it started working again.
And it worked for our grandparents, our parents, and it's going to work for us. (Applause) So what you should do is really simple.
Stand up for what you believe in, support the organizations that you care about, speak out on the issues that matter to you, get involved, make change, express you opinion, and do it with respect and knowledge and confidence that it's only by working together that the constitutional technology can do the job that it is designed to do.
Stand up for what you believe, but take a deep breath while you do it. It's going to be OK.
I'd like to introduce you to my mom.
(Laughter)
I'm guessing that's not what you expected, and it's not what I expected either, and thank goodness I realized that an Asian man was not my mom before I hugged him, because that would have been so awkward.
Recognizing people isn't one of my strengths due to a genetic visual impairment that has no correction or cure.
As a result, I am legally blind, though I prefer "partially sighted" because it's more optimistic.
(Laughter)
And I'm entitled to the label "disabled."
I hate the word disabled when it's used to describe people.
It detonates a mindset of less than that utterly disregards capacity, ability, potential, instead prioritizing brokenness and lack.
The perspective can be overt.
What can't he do for himself that I'm going to have to do for him?
She'll probably need some accommodation that no other employee at this business needs.
Sometimes, the hidden bias is so sweetly conveyed. "Wow, Susan, look at everything you've done in your career and your life.
How did you do all of that and be visually impaired?"
(Laughter)
I fail at being disabled.
(Laughter)
So in the spirit of incentivizing the rampant failure of people all over the world and enticing the so-called normal to just give it a rest already, here are five tips to fail at being disabled.
Tip one: know your superpowers.
The best team I ever led in my career was based on superpowers, and we even gave ourselves fancy-pantsy titles like "the Pillar of Masterly Acumen." "The Biscuit Butterer."
(Laughter)
"The Voice of Reason."
Because we relied on our strengths, our best strengths, we achieved tremendous outcomes.
The trait that prevents me from recognizing my mom allows me to smoothly adapt, to quickly absorb and accurately process an exhausting volume of cues, tease out what's important, determine multiple processes or potentials for any situation that I'm in, and then select the one that makes the most sense, all in a matter of seconds.
I see what other people do not.
Some people think that's a superpower, but my real superpowers are ricocheting off of glass walls --
(Laughter)
and letting my friends walk around with kale in their teeth.
(Laughter)
It's true. Don't have lunch with me, or dinner.
Tip two: be supremely skilled, supremely skilled at getting it wrong.
It is important to be as equally confident in your superpowers as you are in you FUBARs.
That's "effed up beyond all recognition" for you millennials.
(Laughter)
Here's a good example.
It is not a great idea to say, "Don't worry, everything in here is too small for me to see" when you accidentally walk into the men's room --
(Laughter)
at one of the world's largest sporting arenas --
(Laughter)
or anywhere. I really wish that one wasn't true. I'm serious. It is better to just walk out and let them think you're drunk.
(Laughter)
Tip three: know that everyone is disabled in some way, like when you have a cold and you can't smell and you realize that the milk that you splashed in your coffee was sour only after you've tasted it.
Very recently, a woman walked up to me frantic.
She could not find the bakery she was looking for.
As I motioned in the direction I thought she should go, saying, "There are no stores on this side of the street so your best bet is to cross --"
"Oh my goodness," she interrupted. "There it is. All I needed was another set of eyes."
(Laughter)
I just let her have it.
I would have said that, you know, being logical and paying attention and staying calm would have done the trick, but who am I?
Tip four: point out the disability in others.
This one is best reserved -- very important note -- this one is best reserved for people you know well, because random strangers typically don't appreciate teachable moments.
A few years ago, my parents and I went to see the Rockettes, Radio City's high-kicking dancers.
I leaned over to my dad.
"The two Rockettes on the left aren't kicking in a straight line."
"Yes, they are."
"No, they're not."
"Yes, they are, and how do you know?
You can't see."
But I know what a straight line looks like.
I had snapped a picture during our back and forth and presented him the evidence that proved I was right.
He looked at the picture.
I leaned in further.
"Who's disabled now?"
Tip five: pursue audacious goals.
Flip expectation upside down and shove limitation off a cliff to meet its demise.
There is a college football linebacker who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles while having one hand.
There is a teacher who successfully transfers knowledge and inspires countless students while living with Down syndrome.
And for me, on my long list, to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal, to Darjeeling, India on the backseat of a bicycle built for two.
It will be an exciting 620-mile adventure, and I'm sure I will have the blurry photos to show for it.
(Laughter)
Oh, before we go on, I forgot to introduce you to my mom.
I need to do that.
And here she is, as she would appear to me if I were looking through a crowd of people looking for her.
Or is that an Asian man?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Cancer. Many of us have lost family, friends or loved ones to this horrible disease.
I know there are some of you in the audience who are cancer survivors, or who are fighting cancer at this moment.
My heart goes out to you.
While this word often conjures up emotions of sadness and anger and fear, I bring you good news from the front lines of cancer research.
The fact is, we are starting to win the war on cancer.
In fact, we lie at the intersection of the three of the most exciting developments within cancer research.
The first is cancer genomics.
The genome is a composition of all the genetic information encoded by DNA in an organism.
In cancers, changes in the DNA called mutations are what drive these cancers to go out of control.
Around 10 years ago, I was part of the team at Johns Hopkins that first mapped the mutations of cancers.
We did this first for colorectal, breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.
And since then, there have been over 90 projects in 70 countries all over the world, working to understand the genetic basis of these diseases.
Today, tens of thousands of cancers are understood down to exquisite molecular detail.
The second revolution is precision medicine, also known as "personalized medicine." Instead of one-size-fits-all methods to be able to treat cancers, there is a whole new class of drugs that are able to target cancers based on their unique genetic profile.
Today, there are a host of these tailor-made drugs, called targeted therapies, available to physicians even today to be able to personalize their therapy for their patients, and many others are in development.
The third exciting revolution is immunotherapy, and this is really exciting.
Scientists have been able to leverage the immune system in the fight against cancer.
For example, there have been ways where we find the off switches of cancer, and new drugs have been able to turn the immune system back on, to be able to fight cancer.
In addition, there are ways where you can take away immune cells from the body, train them, engineer them and put them back into the body to fight cancer.
Almost sounds like science fiction, doesn't it?
While I was a researcher at the National Cancer Institute, I had the privilege of working with some of the pioneers of this field and watched the development firsthand.
It's been pretty amazing.
Today, over 600 clinical trials are open, actively recruiting patients to explore all aspects in immunotherapy.
While these three exciting revolutions are ongoing, unfortunately, this is only the beginning, and there are still many, many challenges.
Let me illustrate with a patient.
Here is a patient with a skin cancer called melanoma.
It's horrible; the cancer has gone everywhere.
However, scientists were able to map the mutations of this cancer and give a specific treatment that targets one of the mutations.
And the result is almost miraculous.
Tumors almost seem to melt away.
Unfortunately, this is not the end of the story.
A few months later, this picture is taken.
The tumor has come back.
The question is: Why?
The answer is tumor heterogeneity. Let me explain.
Even a cancer as small as one centimeter in diameter harbors over a hundred million different cells.
While genetically similar, there are small differences in these different cancers that make them differently prone to different drugs.
So even if you have a drug that's highly effective, that kills almost all the cells, there is a chance that there's a small population that's resistant to the drug.
This ultimately is the population that comes back, and takes over the patient.
So then the question is: What do we do with this information?
Well, the key, then, is to apply all these exciting advancements in cancer therapy earlier, as soon as we can, before these resistance clones emerge.
The key to cancer and curing cancer is early detection.
And we intuitively know this.
Finding cancer early results in better outcomes, and the numbers show this as well.
For example, in ovarian cancer, if you detect cancer in stage four, only 17 percent of the women survive at five years.
However, if you are able to detect this cancer as early as stage one, over 92 percent of women will survive.
But the sad fact is, only 15 percent of women are detected at stage one, whereas the vast majority, 70 percent, are detected in stages three and four.
We desperately need better detection mechanisms for cancers.
The current best ways to screen cancer fall into one of three categories.
First is medical procedures, which is like colonoscopy for colon cancer.
Second is protein biomarkers, like PSA for prostate cancer.
Or third, imaging techniques, such as mammography for breast cancer.
Medical procedures are the gold standard; however, they are highly invasive and require a large infrastructure to implement.
Protein markers, while effective in some populations, are not very specific in some circumstances, resulting in high numbers of false positives, which then results in unnecessary work-ups and unnecessary procedures.
Imaging methods, while useful in some populations, expose patients to harmful radiation.
In addition, it is not applicable to all patients.
For example, mammography has problems in women with dense breasts.
So what we need is a method that is noninvasive, that is light in infrastructure, that is highly specific, that also does not have false positives, does not use any radiation and is applicable to large populations.
Even more importantly, we need a method to be able to detect cancers before they're 100 million cells in size.
Does such a technology exist?
Well, I wouldn't be up here giving a talk if it didn't.
I'm excited to tell you about this latest technology we've developed.
Central to our technology is a simple blood test.
The blood circulatory system, while seemingly mundane, is essential for you to survive, providing oxygen and nutrients to your cells, and removing waste and carbon dioxide.
Here's a key biological insight: Cancer cells grow and die faster than normal cells, and when they die, DNA is shed into the blood system.
Since we know the signatures of these cancer cells from all the different cancer genome sequencing projects, we can look for those signals in the blood to be able to detect these cancers early.
So instead of waiting for cancers to be large enough to cause symptoms, or for them to be dense enough to show up on imaging, or for them to be prominent enough for you to be able to visualize on medical procedures, we can start looking for cancers while they are relatively pretty small, by looking for these small amounts of DNA in the blood.
So let me tell you how we do this.
First, like I said, we start off with a simple blood test -- no radiation, no complicated equipment -- a simple blood test.
Then the blood is shipped to us, and what we do is extract the DNA out of it.
While your body is mostly healthy cells, most of the DNA that's detected will be from healthy cells.
However, there will be a small amount, less than one percent, that comes from the cancer cells.
Then we use molecular biology methods to be able to enrich this DNA for areas of the genome which are known to be associated with cancer, based on the information from the cancer genomics projects.
We're able to then put this DNA into DNA-sequencing machines and are able to digitize the DNA into A's, C's, T's and G's and have this final readout.
Ultimately, we have information of billions of letters that output from this run.
We then apply statistical and computational methods to be able to find the small signal that's present, indicative of the small amount of cancer DNA in the blood.
So does this actually work in patients?
Well, because there's no way of really predicting right now which patients will get cancer, we use the next best population: cancers in remission; specifically, lung cancer.
The sad fact is, even with the best drugs that we have today, most lung cancers come back.
The key, then, is to see whether we're able to detect these recurrences of cancers earlier than with standard methods.
We just finished a major trial with Professor Charles Swanton at University College London, examining this.
Let me walk you through an example of one patient.
Here's an example of one patient who undergoes surgery at time point zero, and then undergoes chemotherapy.
Then the patient is under remission.
He is monitored using clinical exams and imaging methods.
Around day 450, unfortunately, the cancer comes back.
The question is: Are we able to catch this earlier?
During this whole time, we've been collecting blood serially to be able to measure the amount of ctDNA in the blood.
So at the initial time point, as expected, there's a high level of cancer DNA in the blood.
However, this goes away to zero in subsequent time points and remains negligible after subsequent points.
However, around day 340, we see the rise of cancer DNA in the blood, and eventually, it goes up higher for days 400 and 450.
Here's the key, if you've missed it: At day 340, we see the rise in the cancer DNA in the blood.
That means we are catching this cancer over a hundred days earlier than traditional methods.
This is a hundred days earlier where we can give therapies, a hundred days earlier where we can do surgical interventions, or even a hundred days less for the cancer to grow or a hundred days less for resistance to occur.
For some patients, this hundred days means the matter of life and death.
We're really excited about this information.
Because of this assignment, we've done additional studies now in other cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer and ovarian cancer, and I can't wait to see how much earlier we can find these cancers.
Ultimately, I have a dream, a dream of two vials of blood, and that, in the future, as part of all of our standard physical exams, we'll have two vials of blood drawn.
And from these two vials of blood we will be able to compare the DNA from all known signatures of cancer, and hopefully then detect cancers months to even years earlier.
Even with the therapies we have currently, this could mean that millions of lives could be saved.
And if you add on to that recent advancements in immunotherapy and targeted therapies, the end of cancer is in sight.
The next time you hear the word "cancer," I want you to add to the emotions: hope. Hold on. Cancer researchers all around the world are working feverishly to beat this disease, and tremendous progress is being made.
This is the beginning of the end.
We will win the war on cancer.
And to me, this is amazing news.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Here's a question for you: how many different scents do you think you can smell, and maybe even identify with accuracy? 100? 300? 1,000? One study estimates that humans can detect up to one trillion different odors. A trillion. It's hard to imagine, but your nose has the molecular machinery to make it happen.
Olfactory receptors -- tiny scent detectors -- are packed into your nose, each one patiently waiting to be activated by the odor, or ligand, that it's been assigned to detect.
It turns out we humans, like all vertebrates, have lots of olfactory receptors.
In fact, more of our DNA is devoted to genes for different olfactory receptors than for any other type of protein.
Why is that? Could olfactory receptors be doing something else in addition to allowing us to smell?
In 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axel uncovered the molecular identity of olfactory receptors -- work which ultimately led to a Nobel Prize.
At the time, we all assumed that these receptors were only found in the nose.
However, about a year or so later, a report emerged of an olfactory receptor expressed in a tissue other than the nose.
And then another such report emerged, and another.
We now know that these receptors are found all over the body, including in some pretty unexpected places -- in muscle, in kidneys, lungs and blood vessels.
But what are they doing there? Well, we know that olfactory receptors act as sensitive chemical sensors in the nose -- that's how they mediate our sense of smell.
It turns out they also act as sensitive chemical sensors in many other parts of the body.
Now, I'm not saying that your liver can detect the aroma of your morning coffee as you walk into the kitchen. Rather, after you drink your morning coffee, your liver might use an olfactory receptor to chemically detect the change in concentration of a chemical floating through your bloodstream.
Many cell types and tissues in the body use chemical sensors, or chemosensors, to keep track of the concentration of hormones, metabolites and other molecules, and some of these chemosensors are olfactory receptors.
If you are a pancreas or a kidney and you need a specialized chemical sensor that will allow you to keep track of a specific molecule, why reinvent the wheel?
One of the first examples of an olfactory receptor found outside the nose showed that human sperm express an olfactory receptor, and that sperm with this receptor will seek out the chemical that the receptor responds to -- the receptor's ligand.
That is, the sperm will swim toward the ligand.
This has intriguing implications.
Are sperm aided in finding the egg by sniffing out the area with the highest ligand concentration?
I like this example because it clearly demonstrates that an olfactory receptor's primary job is to be a chemical sensor, but depending on the context, it can influence how you perceive a smell, or in which direction sperm will swim, and as it turns out, a huge variety of other processes.
Olfactory receptors -- in muscle, Olfactory receptors have been implicated in muscle cell migration, in helping the lung to sense and respond to inhaled chemicals,
Similarly, taste receptors once thought to be found only in the tongue, are now known to be expressed in cells and tissues throughout the body.
Even more surprisingly, a recent study found that the light receptors in our eyes also play a role in our blood vessels.
In my lab, we work on trying to understand the roles of olfactory receptors and taste receptors in the context of the kidney.
The kidney is a central control center for homeostasis.
And to us, it makes sense that a homeostatic control center would be a logical place to employ chemical sensors.
We've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors in the kidney, one of which, olfactory receptor 78, is known to be expressed in cells and tissues that are important in the regulation of blood pressure.
When this receptor is deleted in mice, their blood pressure is low.
Surprisingly, this receptor was found to respond to chemicals called short-chain fatty acids that are produced by the bacteria that reside in your gut -- your gut microbiota.
After being produced by your gut microbiota, these chemicals are absorbed into your bloodstream where they can then interact with receptors like olfactory receptor 78, meaning that the changes in metabolism of your gut microbiota may influence your blood pressure.
in the kidney, Although we've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors we've only just begun to tease out their different functions and to figure out which chemicals each of them responds to.
Similar investigations lie ahead for many other organs and tissues -- only a small minority of receptors has been studied to date.
This is exciting stuff.
It's revolutionizing our understanding of the scope of influence for one of the five senses.
And it has the potential to change our understanding of some aspects of human physiology.
It's still early, but I think we've picked up on the scent of something we're following.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
(Applause)
The first time I cried underwater was in 2008, the island of Curaçao, way down in the southern Caribbean.
It's beautiful there.
I was studying these corals for my PhD, and after days and days of diving on the same reef, I had gotten to know them as individuals.
I had made friends with coral colonies -- totally a normal thing to do.
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart and ripped off their skin, leaving little bits of wounded tissue that would have a hard time healing, and big patches of dead skeleton that would get overgrown by algae.
When I saw this damage for the first time, stretching all the way down the reef, I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear and I cried.
If a coral could die that fast, how could a reef ever survive?
And why was I making it my job to try to fight for them?
I never heard another scientist tell that kind of story until last year.
A scientist in Guam wrote, "I cried right into my mask," seeing the damage on the reefs.
Then a scientist in Australia wrote, "I showed my students the results of our coral surveys, and we wept." Crying about corals is having a moment, guys.
(Laughter)
And that's because reefs in the Pacific are losing corals faster than we've ever seen before.
Because of climate change, the water is so hot for so long in the summers, that these animals can't function normally.
They're spitting out the colored algae that lives in their skin, and the clear bleached tissue that's left usually starves to death and then rots away.
Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae.
This is happening over an unbelievable scale.
The Northern Great Barrier Reef lost two-thirds of its corals last year over a distance of hundreds of miles, then bleached again this year, and the bleaching stretched further south.
Reefs in the Pacific are in a nosedive right now, and no one knows how bad it's going to get, except... over in the Caribbean where I work, we've already been through the nosedive.
Reefs there have suffered through centuries of intense human abuse.
We kind of already know how the story goes.
And we might be able to help predict what happens next.
Let's consult a graph. Since the invention of scuba, scientists have measured the amount of coral on the seafloor, and how it's changed through time.
And after centuries of ratcheting human pressure, Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.
Some reefs lost their corals very quickly.
Some reefs lost their corals more slowly, but kind of ended up in the same place.
OK, so far this is not going very well.
But some reefs in the Caribbean -- the ones best protected and the ones a little further from humans -- they managed to hold onto their corals.
Give us a challenge.
And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero.
The second time I cried underwater was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.
It was the calmest day of the year, but it's always pretty sketchy diving there.
My boyfriend and I swam against the waves.
I watched my compass so we could find our way back out, and he watched for sharks, and after 20 minutes of swimming that felt like an hour, we finally dropped down to the reef, and I was so shocked, and I was so happy that my eyes filled with tears.
There were corals 1,000 years old lined up one after another.
They had survived the entire history of European colonialism in the Caribbean, and for centuries before that.
I never knew what a coral could do when it was given a chance to thrive.
The truth is that even as we lose so many corals, even as we go through this massive coral die-off, some reefs will survive.
Some will be ragged on the edge, some will be beautiful.
And by protecting shorelines and giving us food to eat and supporting tourism, they will still be worth billions and billions of dollars a year.
The best time to protect a reef was 50 years ago, but the second-best time is right now.
Even as we go through bleaching events, more frequent and in more places, some corals will be able to recover.
We had a bleaching event in 2010 in the Caribbean that took off big patches of skin on boulder corals like these.
This coral lost half of its skin.
But if you look at the side of this coral a few years later, this coral is actually healthy again.
It's doing what a healthy coral does.
It's making copies of its polyps, it's fighting back the algae and it's reclaiming its territory.
If a few polyps survive, a coral can regrow; it just needs time and protection and a reasonable temperature.
Some corals can regrow in 10 years -- others take a lot longer.
But the more stresses we take off them locally -- things like overfishing, sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution, dredging, coastal construction -- the better they can hang on as we stabilize the climate, and the faster they can regrow.
And as we go through the long, tough and necessary process of stabilizing the climate of planet Earth, some new corals will still be born.
This is what I study in my research.
We try to understand how corals make babies, and how those babies find their way to the reef, and we invent new methods to help them survive those early, fragile life stages.
One of my favorite coral babies of all time showed up right after Hurricane Omar.
It's the same species I was studying before the storm, but you almost never see babies of this species -- it's really rare.
This is actually an endangered species.
In this photo, this little baby coral, this little circle of polyps, is a few years old.
it's fighting back the algae Like its cousins that bleach,
And like its cousins on the north shore, it's aiming to live for 1,000 years.
What's happening in the world and in the ocean has changed our time horizon.
We can be incredibly pessimistic on the short term, and mourn what we lost and what we really took for granted.
But we can still be optimistic on the long term, and we can still be ambitious about what we fight for and what we expect from our governments, from our planet.
Corals have been living on planet Earth for hundreds of millions of years.
They survived the extinction of the dinosaurs. They're badasses.
(Laughter)
An individual coral can go through tremendous trauma and fully recover if it's given a chance and it's given protection.
Corals have always been playing the long game, and now so are we.
Thanks very much.
(Applause)
Today I'm going to talk about technology and society.
The Department of Transport estimated that last year 35,000 people died from traffic crashes in the US alone.
Worldwide, 1.2 million people die every year in traffic accidents.
If there was a way we could eliminate 90 percent of those accidents, would you support it?
Of course you would.
This is what driverless car technology promises to achieve by eliminating the main source of accidents -- human error.
Now picture yourself in a driverless car in the year 2030, sitting back and watching this vintage TEDxCambridge video.
(Laughter)
All of a sudden, the car experiences mechanical failure and is unable to stop.
If the car continues, it will crash into a bunch of pedestrians crossing the street, but the car may swerve, hitting one bystander, killing them to save the pedestrians.
What should the car do, and who should decide?
What if instead the car could swerve into a wall, crashing and killing you, the passenger, in order to save those pedestrians?
This scenario is inspired by the trolley problem, which was invented by philosophers a few decades ago to think about ethics.
Now, the way we think about this problem matters.
We may for example not think about it at all.
We may say this scenario is unrealistic, incredibly unlikely, or just silly.
But I think this criticism misses the point because it takes the scenario too literally.
Of course no accident is going to look like this; no accident has two or three options where everybody dies somehow.
Instead, the car is going to calculate something like the probability of hitting a certain group of people, if you swerve one direction versus another direction, you might slightly increase the risk to passengers or other drivers versus pedestrians.
It's going to be a more complex calculation, but it's still going to involve trade-offs, and trade-offs often require ethics.
We might say then, "Well, let's not worry about this.
Let's wait until technology is fully ready and 100 percent safe." Suppose that we can indeed eliminate 90 percent of those accidents, or even 99 percent in the next 10 years.
What if eliminating the last one percent of accidents requires 50 more years of research?
Should we not adopt the technology?
That's 60 million people dead in car accidents if we maintain the current rate.
So the point is, waiting for full safety is also a choice, and it also involves trade-offs.
People online on social media have been coming up with all sorts of ways to not think about this problem.
One person suggested the car should just swerve somehow in between the passengers --
(Laughter)
and the bystander. Of course if that's what the car can do, that's what the car should do.
We're interested in scenarios in which this is not possible.
And my personal favorite was a suggestion by a blogger to have an eject button in the car that you press --
(Laughter)
just before the car self-destructs.
(Laughter)
So if we acknowledge that cars will have to make trade-offs on the road, how do we think about those trade-offs, and how do we decide?
Well, maybe we should run a survey to find out what society wants, because ultimately, regulations and the law are a reflection of societal values.
So this is what we did.
With my collaborators, Jean-François Bonnefon and Azim Shariff, we ran a survey in which we presented people with these types of scenarios.
We gave them two options inspired by two philosophers: Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant.
Bentham says the car should follow utilitarian ethics: it should take the action that will minimize total harm — even if that action will kill a bystander and even if that action will kill the passenger.
Immanuel Kant says the car should follow duty-bound principles, like "Thou shalt not kill." So you should not take an action that explicitly harms a human being, and you should let the car take its course even if that's going to harm more people.
What do you think? Bentham or Kant? Here's what we found. Most people sided with Bentham.
So it seems that people want cars to be utilitarian, minimize total harm, and that's what we should all do. Problem solved. But there is a little catch.
When we asked people whether they would purchase such cars, they said, "Absolutely not."
(Laughter)
They would like to buy cars that protect them at all costs, but they want everybody else to buy cars that minimize harm.
(Laughter)
We've seen this problem before.
It's called a social dilemma.
And to understand the social dilemma, we have to go a little bit back in history.
In the 1800s, English economist William Forster Lloyd published a pamphlet which describes the following scenario.
You have a group of farmers -- English farmers -- who are sharing a common land for their sheep to graze.
Now, if each farmer brings a certain number of sheep -- let's say three sheep -- the land will be rejuvenated, the farmers are happy, the sheep are happy, everything is good.
Now, if one farmer brings one extra sheep, that farmer will do slightly better, and no one else will be harmed.
But if every farmer made that individually rational decision, the land will be overrun, and it will be depleted to the detriment of all the farmers, and of course, to the detriment of the sheep.
We see this problem in many places: in the difficulty of managing overfishing, or in reducing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change.
When it comes to the regulation of driverless cars, the common land now is basically public safety -- that's the common good -- and the farmers are the passengers or the car owners who are choosing to ride in those cars.
And by making the individually rational choice of prioritizing their own safety, they may collectively be diminishing the common good, which is minimizing total harm.
It's called the tragedy of the commons, traditionally, but I think in the case of driverless cars, the problem may be a little bit more insidious because there is not necessarily an individual human being making those decisions.
So car manufacturers may simply program cars that will maximize safety for their clients, and those cars may learn automatically on their own that doing so requires slightly increasing risk for pedestrians.
So to use the sheep metaphor, it's like we now have electric sheep that have a mind of their own.
(Laughter)
And they may go and graze even if the farmer doesn't know it.
So this is what we may call the tragedy of the algorithmic commons, and if offers new types of challenges.
Typically, traditionally, we solve these types of social dilemmas using regulation, so either governments or communities get together, and they decide collectively what kind of outcome they want and what sort of constraints on individual behavior they need to implement.
And then using monitoring and enforcement, they can make sure that the public good is preserved.
So why don't we just, as regulators, require that all cars minimize harm?
After all, this is what people say they want.
And more importantly, I can be sure that as an individual, if I buy a car that may sacrifice me in a very rare case, I'm not the only sucker doing that while everybody else enjoys unconditional protection.
In our survey, we did ask people whether they would support regulation and here's what we found.
First of all, people said no to regulation; and second, they said, "Well if you regulate cars to do this and to minimize total harm, I will not buy those cars." So ironically, by regulating cars to minimize harm, we may actually end up with more harm because people may not opt into the safer technology even if it's much safer than human drivers.
I don't have the final answer to this riddle, but I think as a starting point, we need society to come together to decide what trade-offs we are comfortable with and to come up with ways in which we can enforce those trade-offs.
As a starting point, my brilliant students, Edmond Awad and Sohan Dsouza, built the Moral Machine website, which generates random scenarios at you -- basically a bunch of random dilemmas in a sequence where you have to choose what the car should do in a given scenario.
And we vary the ages and even the species of the different victims.
So far we've collected over five million decisions by over one million people worldwide from the website.
And this is helping us form an early picture of what trade-offs people are comfortable with and what matters to them -- even across cultures.
But more importantly, doing this exercise is helping people recognize the difficulty of making those choices and that the regulators are tasked with impossible choices.
And maybe this will help us as a society understand the kinds of trade-offs that will be implemented ultimately in regulation.
And indeed, I was very happy to hear that the first set of regulations that came from the Department of Transport -- announced last week -- included a 15-point checklist for all carmakers to provide, and number 14 was ethical consideration -- how are you going to deal with that.
We also have people reflect on their own decisions by giving them summaries of what they chose.
I'll give you one example -- I'm just going to warn you that this is not your typical example, your typical user.
This is the most sacrificed and the most saved character for this person.
(Laughter)
Some of you may agree with him, or her, we don't know.
But this person also seems to slightly prefer passengers over pedestrians in their choices and is very happy to punish jaywalking.
(Laughter)
So let's wrap up. We started with the question -- let's call it the ethical dilemma -- of what the car should do in a specific scenario: swerve or stay?
But then we realized that the problem was a different one.
It was the problem of how to get society to agree on and enforce the trade-offs they're comfortable with.
It's a social dilemma.
In the 1940s, Isaac Asimov wrote his famous laws of robotics -- the three laws of robotics.
A robot may not harm a human being, a robot may not disobey a human being, and a robot may not allow itself to come to harm -- in this order of importance.
But after 40 years or so and after so many stories pushing these laws to the limit, Asimov introduced the zeroth law which takes precedence above all, and it's that a robot may not harm humanity as a whole.
I don't know what this means in the context of driverless cars or any specific situation, and I don't know how we can implement it, but I think that by recognizing that the regulation of driverless cars is not only a technological problem but also a societal cooperation problem, I hope that we can at least begin to ask the right questions.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
That's SpotMini. He'll be back in a little while.
I -- (Applause)
I love building robots. And my long-term goal is to build robots that can do what people and animals do.
And there's three things in particular that we're interested in.
One is balance and dynamic mobility, the second one is mobile manipulation, and the third one is mobile perception.
So, dynamic mobility and balance -- I'm going to do a demo for you.
I'm standing here, balancing. I can see you're not very impressed.
OK, how about now? (Laughter)
How about now?
(Applause)
Those simple capabilities mean that people can go almost anywhere on earth, on any kind of terrain.
We want to capture that for robots.
What about manipulation? I'm holding this clicker in my hand; I'm not even looking at it, and I can manipulate it without any problem.
But even more important, I can move my body while I hold the manipulator, the clicker, and stabilize and coordinate my body, and I can even walk around.
And that means I can move around in the world and expand the range of my arms and my hands and really be able to handle almost anything.
So that's mobile manipulation.
And all of you can do this.
Third is perception. I'm looking at a room with over 1,000 people in it, and my amazing visual system can see every one of you -- you're all stable in space, even when I move my head, even when I move around.
That kind of mobile perception is really important for robots that are going to move and act out in the world.
I'm going to give you a little status report on where we are in developing robots toward these ends.
The first three robots are all dynamically stabilized robots.
This one goes back a little over 10 years ago -- "BigDog." It's got a gyroscope that helps stabilize it.
It's got sensors and a control computer.
Here's a Cheetah robot that's running with a galloping gait, where it recycles its energy, it bounces on the ground, and it's computing all the time in order to keep itself stabilized and propelled.
And here's a bigger robot that's got such good locomotion using its legs, that it can go in deep snow.
This is about 10 inches deep, and it doesn't really have any trouble.
This is Spot, a new generation of robot -- just slightly older than the one that came out onstage.
And we've been asking the question -- you've all heard about drone delivery: Can we deliver packages to your houses with drones? Well, what about plain old legged-robot delivery?
(Laughter) So we've been taking our robot to our employees' homes to see whether we could get in --
(Laughter) the various access ways. And believe me, in the Boston area, there's every manner of stairway twists and turns.
So it's a real challenge. But we're doing very well, about 70 percent of the way.
And here's mobile manipulation, where we've put an arm on the robot, and it's finding its way through the door.
Now, one of the important things about making autonomous robots is to make them not do just exactly what you say, but make them deal with the uncertainty of what happens in the real world.
(Laughter) So we have Steve there, one of the engineers, giving the robot a hard time.
And the fact that the programming still tolerates all that disturbance -- it does what it's supposed to.
Here's another example, where Eric is tugging on the robot as it goes up the stairs.
And believe me, getting it to do what it's supposed to do in those circumstances is a real challenge, but the result is something that's going to generalize and make robots much more autonomous than they would be otherwise.
This is Atlas, a humanoid robot.
It's a third-generation humanoid that we've been building.
I'll tell you a little bit about the hardware design later.
And we've been saying: How close to human levels of performance and speed could we get in an ordinary task, like moving boxes around on a conveyor?
We're getting up to about two-thirds of the speed that a human operates on average.
And this robot is using both hands, it's using its body, it's stepping, so it's really an example of dynamic stability, mobile manipulation and mobile perception. Here --
(Laughter)
We actually have two Atlases.
(Laughter)
Now, everything doesn't go exactly the way it's supposed to.
(Laughter)
And here's our latest robot, called "Handle." Handle is interesting, because it's sort of half like an animal, and it's half something else with these leg-like things and wheels.
It's got its arms on in kind of a funny way, but it really does some remarkable things.
It can carry 100 pounds.
It's probably going to lift more than that, but so far we've done 100.
It's got some pretty good rough-terrain capability, even though it has wheels.
And Handle loves to put on a show.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I'm going to give you a little bit of robot religion.
A lot of people think that a robot is a machine where there's a computer that's telling it what to do, and the computer is listening through its sensors.
But that's really only half of the story.
The real story is that the computer is on one side, making suggestions to the robot, and on the other side are the physics of the world. And that physics involves gravity, friction, bouncing into things.
In order to have a successful robot, my religion is that you have to do a holistic design, where you're designing the software, the hardware and the behavior all at one time, and all these parts really intermesh and cooperate with each other.
And when you get the perfect design, you get a real harmony between all those parts interacting with each other.
So it's half software and half hardware, plus the behavior.
We've done some work lately on the hardware, where we tried to go — the picture on the left is a conventional design, where you have parts that are all bolted together, conductors, tubes, connectors. And on the right is a more integrated thing; it's supposed to look like an anatomy drawing.
Using the miracle of 3-D printing, we're starting to build parts of robots that look a lot more like the anatomy of an animal.
So that's an upper-leg part that has hydraulic pathways -- actuators, filters -- all embedded, all printed as one piece, and the whole structure is developed with a knowledge of what the loads and behavior are going to be, which is available from data recorded from robots and simulations and things like that.
So it's a data-driven hardware design.
And using processes like that, not only the upper leg but some other things, we've gotten our robots to go from big, behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots -- that one on the right, weighing almost 400 pounds -- down to the one in the middle which was just in the video, weighs about 190 pounds, just a little bit more than me, and we have a new one, which is working but I'm not going to show it to you yet, on the left, which weighs just 165 pounds, with all the same strength and capabilities.
So these things are really getting better very quickly.
So it's time for Spot to come back out, and we're going to demonstrate a little bit of mobility, dexterity and perception.
This is Seth Davis, who's my robot wrangler today, and he's giving Spot some general direction by steering it around, but all the coordination of the legs and the sensors is done by the robot's computers on board.
The robot can walk with a number of different gaits; it's got a gyro, or a solid-state gyro, an IMU on board.
Obviously, it's got a battery, and things like that.
One of the cool things about a legged robot is, it's omnidirectional.
In addition to going forward, it can go sideways, it can turn in place.
And this robot is a little bit of a show-off.
It loves to use its dynamic gaits, like running --
(Laughter)
And it's got one more.
(Laughter)
Now if it were really a show-off, it would be hopping on one foot, but, you know.
Now, Spot has a set of cameras here, stereo cameras, and we have a feed up in the center.
It's kind of dark out in the audience, but it's going to use those cameras in order to look at the terrain right in front of it, while it goes over these obstacles back here.
For this demo, Seth is steering, but the robot's doing all its own terrain planning.
This is a terrain map, where the data from the cameras is being developed in real time, showing the red spots, which are where it doesn't want to step, and the green spots are the good places.
And here it's treating them like stepping-stones.
So it's trying to stay up on the blocks, and it adjusts its stride, and there's a ton of planning that has to go into an operation like that, and it does all that planning in real time, where it adjusts the steps a little bit longer or a little bit shorter.
Now we're going to change it into a different mode, where it's just going to treat the blocks like terrain and decide whether to step up or down as it goes.
and mobile perception. So this is using dynamic balance because it has to coordinate what it sees along with how it's moving.
The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.
Some of you may see that as a head and a neck, but believe me, it's an arm.
Seth is driving it around.
He's actually driving the hand and the body is following.
So the two are coordinated in the way I was talking about before -- in the way people can do that.
In fact, one of the cool things Spot can do we call, "chicken-head mode," and it keeps its head in one place in space, and it moves its body all around.
There's a variation of this that's called "twerking" --
(Laughter) but we're not going to use that today.
So, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty.
Could you get me a soda?
For this demo, Seth is not doing any driving.
We have a LIDAR on the back of the robot, and it's using these props we've put on the stage to localize itself.
It's gone over to that location.
Now it's using a camera that's in its hand to find the cup, picks it up -- and again, Seth's not driving.
We've planned out a path for it to go -- it looked like it was going off the path -- and now Seth's going to take over control again, because I'm a little bit chicken about having it do this by itself.
Thank you, Spot.
(Applause)
So, Spot: How do you feel about having just finished your TED performance?
(Laughter)
Me, too!
(Laughter)
Thank you all, and thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics, who did all the hard work behind this.
(Applause)
Helen Walters: Marc, come back in the middle. Thank you so much. Come over here, I have questions.
So, you mentioned the UPS and the package delivery.
What are the other applications that you see for your robots?
Marc Raibert: You know, I think that robots that have the capabilities I've been talking about are going to be incredibly useful.
About a year ago, I went to Fukushima to see what the situation was there, and there's just a huge need for machines that can go into some of the dirty places and help remediate that.
I think it won't be too long until we have robots like this in our homes, and one of the big needs is to take care of the aging and invalids.
I think that it won't be too long till we're using robots to help take care of our parents, or probably more likely, have our children help take care of us.
And there's a bunch of other things.
I think the sky's the limit.
Many of the ideas we haven't thought of yet, and people like you will help us think of new applications.
HW: So what about the dark side?
What about the military? Are they interested?
MR: Sure, the military has been a big funder of robotics.
I don't think the military is the dark side myself, but I think, as with all advanced technology, it can be used for all kinds of things.
HW: Awesome. Thank you so much. MR: OK, you're welcome.
I love museums. Have you guys ever been to the Natural History Museum? In New York City?
(Applause)
So one of the things that I do is I take my kids to the museum.
Recently I took them to the Natural History Museum.
I had my two sons with me, Sabian and Dabith.
And we go into the front entrance of the museum, and there's that amazing sculpture of Teddy Roosevelt out there.
You guys know which one I'm talking about.
Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there with one hand on the horse, bold, strong, sleeves rolled up.
I don't know if he's bare-chested, but it kind of feels like it.
(Laughter)
And on the left-hand side of him is a Native American walking.
And on the right-hand side of him is an African-American walking.
And as we're moving up the stairs, getting closer to the sculpture, my oldest son, who's nine, says, "Dad, how come he gets to ride, and they have to walk?"
It stopped me in my tracks.
It stopped me in my tracks.
There was so much history that we would have to go through to try to explain that, and that's something I try to do with them anyways.
It's a question that I probably would have never really asked.
But fundamentally what he was saying was, "That doesn't look fair.
Dad, that doesn't look fair.
And why is this thing that's so not fair sitting outside of such an amazing institution." And his question got me wondering, is there a way for us to amend our public sculptures, our national monuments?
Not erase them, but is there a way to amend them?
Now, I didn't grow up going to museums.
That's not my history.
My mother was 15 years old when I was born. She is amazing. My father was struggling with his own things for most of my life.
If you really want to know the truth, the only reason I got into art is because of a woman.
There was this amazing, amazing, fantastic, beautiful, smart woman, four years older than me, and I wanted to go out with her.
But she said, "You're too young and you're not thinking about your future." So I ran on down to the junior college, registered for some classes, ran on back, and basically was like, "I'm thinking about my future now."
(Laughter)
"Can we go out?"
For the record, she's even more amazing. I married her.
(Applause)
So when I randomly ran down to the junior college and registered for classes, I really wasn't paying attention to what I was registering to.
(Laughter)
So I ended up with an art history class, and I didn't know a thing about art history. But something amazing happened when I went into that class.
For the first time in my academic career, my visual intelligence was required of me.
For the first time.
The professor would put up an image, bold strokes of blues and yellows, and say, "Who's that?" And I'd go, "That's Van Gogh.
Clearly that is Van Gogh.
I got this. "
(Laughter)
I got a B in that class.
For me, that was amazing.
In high school, let's just say I wasn't a great student. OK? In high school, my GPA was .65.
(Laughter)
Decimal point first, six five.
So me getting a B was huge, huge, absolutely huge.
And because of the fact that I realized that I was able to learn things visually that I couldn't learn in other ways, this became my strategy, this became my tactic for understanding everything else.
I wanted to stay in this relationship.
Things were going well. I decided, let me keep taking these art history classes. One of the last art history classes, I will not forget, I will never forget.
It was one of those survey art history classes.
Anybody ever have one of those survey art history classes, where they try to teach you the entire history of art in a single semester?
I'm talking about cave paintings and Jackson Pollock just crunched together all in the same -- It doesn't really work, but they try anyway.
Well, at the beginning of the semester, I looked at the book, and in this 400-page book was about a 14-page section that was on black people in painting.
Now, this was a crammed in section that had representations of black people in painting and black people who painted.
It was poorly curated, let's just put it that way.
(Laughter)
Nonetheless I was really excited about it, because in all the other classes that I had, we didn't even have that conversation.
We didn't talk about it at all.
So imagine my surprise when I get to class and on the day that we're supposed to go over that particular chapter, my professor announces, "We're going to skip this chapter today because we do not have time to go through it."
"Whoa, I'm sorry, hold on, professor, professor. I'm sorry. This is a really important chapter to me.
Are we going to go over it at any point?"
"Titus, we don't have time for this."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, please, I really need to understand.
Clearly the author thinks that this is significant.
Why are we skipping over this?"
"Titus, I do not have time for this."
"OK, last question, I'm really sorry here.
When can we talk, because we need to talk."
(Laughter)
I went to her office hours.
I ended up getting kicked out of her office.
I went to the dean. The dean finally told me, "I can't force her to teach anything." And I knew in that moment if I wanted to understand this history, if I wanted to understand the roles of those folks who had to walk, I was probably going to have to figure that out myself.
So... above you right here on the slide is a painting by Frans Hals.
This is one of the kinds of images that was in that chapter.
I taught myself how to paint by going to museums and looking at images like this.
I want to show you something.
I made this. I --
(Applause)
I made some alterations. You'll see there are some slight differences in the painting.
All this art history that I had been absorbing helped me to realize that painting is a language.
There is a reason why he is the highest in the composition here.
There is a reason why the painter is showing us this gold necklace here.
He's trying to tell us something about the economic status of these people in these paintings.
Painting is a visual language where everything in the painting is meaningful, is important. It's coded. But sometimes, because of the compositional structure, because of compositional hierarchy, it's hard to see other things.
This silk is supposed to tell us also that they have quite a bit of money.
There's more written about dogs in art history than there are about this other character here.
Historically speaking, in research on these kinds of paintings, I can find out more about the lace that the woman is wearing in this painting -- the manufacturer of the lace -- than I can about this character here, about his dreams, about his hopes, about what he wanted out of life.
I want to show you something.
I don't want you to think that this is about eradication. It's not. The oil that you saw me just put inside of this paint is linseed oil.
It becomes transparent over time, so eventually what's going to happen is these faces will emerge a little bit.
What I'm trying to do, what I'm trying to show you, is how to shift your gaze just slightly, just momentarily, just momentarily, to ask yourself the question, why do some have to walk?
What is the impact of these kinds of sculptures at museums?
What is the impact of these kinds of paintings on some of our most vulnerable in society, seeing these kinds of depictions of themselves all the time?
I'm not saying erase it.
We can't erase this history. It's real. We have to know it.
I think of it in the same way we think of --
Let me step back a second.
You remember old-school cameras, where when you took a picture, you actually had to focus. Right? You'd put the camera up, and if I wanted you in focus, I would move the lens a little to the left and you would come forward.
I could move the lens a little to the right, and you would go back and the folks in the background would come out.
I'm just trying to do that here.
I'm trying to give you that opportunity.
I'm trying to answer that question that my son had.
I want to make paintings, I want to make sculptures that are honest, that wrestle with the struggles of our past but speak to the diversity and the advances of our present.
And we can't do that by taking an eraser and getting rid of stuff.
That's just not going to work.
I think that we should do it in the same way the American Constitution works.
When we have a situation where we want to change a law in the American Constitution, we don't erase the other one.
Alongside that is an amendment, something that says, "This is where we were, but this is where we are right now." I figure if we can do that, then that will help us understand a little bit about where we're going.
Thank you.
Loneliness. All of us in this room will experience loneliness at some point in our lives.
Loneliness is not a function of being alone, but rather, a function of how socially connected you are to those around you.
There could be somebody in this room right now surrounded by a thousand people experiencing loneliness.
And while loneliness can be attributed to many things, as an architect, I'm going to tell you today how loneliness can be the result of our built environments -- the very homes we choose to live in.
Let's take a look at this house. It's a nice house.
There's a big yard, picket fence, two-car garage.
And the home might be in a neighborhood like this.
And for many people around the globe, this home, this neighborhood -- it's a dream.
And yet the danger of achieving this dream is a false sense of connection and an increase in social isolation.
I know, I can hear you now, there's somebody in the room screaming at me inside their head, "That's my house, and that's my neighborhood, and I know everyone on my block!" To which I would answer, "Terrific!" And I wish there were more people like you, because I'd wager to guess there's more people in the room living in a similar situation that might not know their neighbors.
They might recognize them and say hello, but under their breath, they're asking their spouse, "What was their name again?" so they can ask a question by name to signify they know them.
Social media also contributes to this false sense of connection.
This image is probably all too familiar.
You're standing in the elevator, sitting in a cafe, and you look around, and everyone's on their phone.
You're not texting or checking Facebook, but everyone else is, and maybe, like me, you've been in a situation where you've made eye contact, smiled and said hello, and have that person yank out their earbuds and say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?" I find this incredibly isolating.
The concept I'd like to share with you today is an antidote to isolation.
It's not a new concept.
In fact, it's an age-old way of living, and it still exists in many non-European cultures around the world.
And about 50 years ago, the Danes decided to make up a new name, and since then, tens of thousands of Danish people have been living in this connected way.
And it's being pursued more widely around the globe as people are seeking community.
This concept is cohousing.
Cohousing is an intentional neighborhood where people know each other and look after one another.
In cohousing, you have your own home, but you also share significant spaces, both indoors and out.
Before I show you some pictures of cohousing, I'd like to first introduce you to my friends Sheila and Spencer.
When I first met Sheila and Spencer, they were just entering their 60s, and Spencer was looking ahead at the end of a long career in elementary education.
And he really disliked the idea that he might not have children in his life upon retirement.
They're now my neighbors.
We live in a cohousing community that I not only designed, but developed and have my architecture practice in.
This community is very intentional about our social interactions.
So let me take you on a tour.
From the outside, we look like any other small apartment building.
In fact, we look identical to the one next door, except that we're bright yellow.
Inside, the homes are fairly conventional. We all have living rooms and kitchens, bedrooms and baths, and there are nine of these homes around a central courtyard.
This one's mine, and this one is Spencer and Sheila's.
The thing that makes this building uniquely cohousing are not the homes, but rather, what happens here -- the social interactions that happen in and around that central courtyard.
When I look across the courtyard, I look forward to see Spencer and Sheila.
In fact, every morning, this is what I see, Spencer waving at me furiously as we're making our breakfasts.
From our homes, we look down into the courtyard, and depending on the time of year, we see this: kids and grownups in various combinations playing and hanging out with each other.
There's a lot of giggling and chatter.
There's a lot of hula-hooping.
And every now and then, "Hey, quit hitting me!" or a cry from one of the kids.
These are the sounds of our daily lives, and the sounds of social connectedness.
At the bottom of the courtyard, there are a set of double doors, and those lead into the common house.
I consider the common house the secret sauce of cohousing.
It's the secret sauce because it's the place where the social interactions and community life begin, and from there, it radiates out through the rest of the community.
Inside our common house, we have a large dining room to seat all 28 of us and our guests, and we dine together three times a week.
In support of those meals, we have a large kitchen so that we can take turns cooking for each other in teams of three.
So that means, with 17 adults, I lead cook once every six weeks.
Two other times, I show up and help my team with the preparation and cleanup.
And all those other nights, I just show up.
I have dinner, talk with my neighbors, and I go home, having been fed a delicious meal by someone who cares about my vegetarian preferences.
Our nine families have intentionally chosen an alternative way of living.
Instead of pursuing the American dream, where we might have been isolated in our single-family homes, we instead chose cohousing, so that we can increase our social connections.
And that's how cohousing starts: with a shared intention to live collaboratively.
And intention is the single most important characteristic that differentiates cohousing from any other housing model.
And while intention is difficult to see or even show, I'm an architect, and I can't help but show you more pictures.
So here are a few examples to illustrate how intention has been expressed in some of the communities I've visited.
Through the careful selection of furniture, lighting and acoustic materials to support eating together; in the careful visual location and visual access to kids' play areas around and inside the common house; in the consideration of scale and distribution of social gathering nodes in and around the community to support our daily lives, all of these spaces help contribute to and elevate the sense of communitas in each community.
What was that word? "Communitas." Communitas is a fancy social science way of saying "spirit of community." And in visiting over 80 different communities, my measure of communitas became: How frequently did residents eat together?
While it's completely up to each group how frequently they have common meals, I know some that have eaten together every single night for the past 40 years.
I know others that have an occasional potluck once or twice a month.
And from my observations, I can tell you, those that eat together more frequently, exhibit higher levels of communitas.
It turns out, when you eat together, you start planning more activities together.
When you eat together, you share more things.
You start to watch each other's kids. You lend our your power tools. You borrow each other's cars.
And despite all this, as my daughter loves to say, everything is not rainbows and unicorns in cohousing, and I'm not best friends with every single person in my community.
We even have differences and conflicts.
But living in cohousing, we're intentional about our relationships.
We're motivated to resolve our differences.
We follow up, we check in, we speak our personal truths and, when appropriate, we apologize.
Skeptics will say that cohousing is only interesting or attractive to a very small group of people.
And I'll agree with that.
If you look at Western cultures around the globe, those living in cohousing are just a fractional percent.
But that needs to change, because our very lives depend upon it.
In 2015, Brigham Young University completed a study that showed a significant increase risk of premature death in those who were living in isolation.
The US Surgeon General has declared isolation to be a public health epidemic.
And this epidemic is not restricted to the US alone.
So when I said earlier that cohousing is an antidote to isolation, what I should have said is that cohousing can save your life.
If I was a doctor, I would tell you to take two aspirin, and call me in the morning.
But as an architect, I'm going to suggest that you take a walk with your neighbor, share a meal together, and call me in 20 years.
Thank you. (Applause)
So 24 years ago, I was brought to The New Yorker as art editor to rejuvenate what had by then become a somewhat staid institution and to bring in new artists and to try to bring the magazine from its ivory tower into engaging with its time.
And it was just the right thing for me to do because I've always been captivated by how an image can -- a simple drawing -- can cut through the torrent of images that we see every single day.
How it can capture a moment, how it can crystallize a social trend or a complex event in a way that a lot of words wouldn't be able to do -- and reduce it to its essence and turn it into a cartoon.
So I went to the library and I looked at the first cover drawn by Rea Irvin in 1925 -- a dandy looking at a butterfly through his monocle, and we call it Eustace Tilley.
And I realized that as the magazine had become known for its in-depth research and long reports, some of the humor had gotten lost along the way, because now often Eustace Tilley was seen as a haughty dandy, but in fact, in 1925, when Rea Irvin first drew this image, he did it as part of a humor magazine to amuse the youth of the era, which was the flappers of the roaring twenties.
And in the library, I found the images that really captured the zeitgeist of the Great Depression.
And it showed us not just how people dressed or what their cars looked like, but also what made them laugh, what their prejudices were.
And you really got a sense of what it felt like to be alive in the '30s.
So I called on contemporary artists, such as Adrian Tomine here.
I often call on narrative artists -- cartoonists, children's book authors -- and I give them themes such as, you know, what it's like to be in the subway, or Valentine's Day, and they send me sketches.
And once the sketches are approved by the editor, David Remnick, it's a go.
And I love the way those images are actually not telling you what to think.
But they do make you think, because the artist is actually -- it's almost a puzzle; the artist is drawing the dots, and you, the reader, have to complete the picture.
So to get this image on the left by Anita Kunz, or the one on right by Tomer Hanuka, you have to play spot the differences.
And it is something that ... It's really exciting to see how the engagement with the reader ... how those images really capture -- play with the stereotypes.
But when you get it, it rearranges the stereotypes that are in your head.
But the images don't just have to show people, sometimes it can be a feeling.
Right after September 11, I was at a point, like everybody else, where I really didn't know how to deal with what we were going through, and I felt that no image could capture this moment, and I wanted to just do a black cover, like no cover.
And I talked to my husband, cartoonist Art Spiegelman, and mentioned to him that I was going to propose that, and he said, "Oh, if you're going to do a black cover, then why don't you do the silhouette of the Twin Towers, black on black?" And I sat down to draw this, and as soon as I saw it, a shiver ran down my spine and I realized that in this refusal to make an image, we had found a way to capture loss and mourning and absence.
And it's been a profound thing that I learned in the process -- that sometimes some of the images that say the most do it with the most spare means.
And a simple image can speak volumes.
So this is the image that we published by Bob Staake right after the election of Barack Obama, and captured a historic moment.
But we can't really plan for this, because in order to do this, we have to let the artist experience the emotions that we all feel when that is happening.
So back in November 2016, during the election last year, the only image that we could publish was this, which was on the stand on the week that everybody voted.
(Laughter)
Because we knew somebody would feel this --
(Laughter)
when the result of the election was announced.
And when we found out the result, we really were at a loss, and this is the image that was sent by Bob Staake again, and that really hit a chord.
And again, we can't really figure out what's going to come next, but here it felt like we didn't know how to move forward, but we did move forward, and this is the image that we published after Donald Trump's election and at the time of the Women's March all over the US.
So over those 24 years, I have seen over 1,000 images come to life week after week, and I'm often asked which one is my favorite, but I can't pick one because what I'm most proud of is how different every image is, one from the other.
And that's due to the talent and the diversity of all of the artists that contribute.
And now, well, now, we're owned by Russia, so --
(Laughter)
In a rendering by Barry Blitt here, Eustace has become Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley.
And the butterfly is none other than a flabbergasted Donald Trump flapping his wings, trying to figure out how to control the butterfly effect, and the famed logo that was drawn by Rae Irvin in 1925 is now in Cyrillic.
So, what makes me really excited about this moment is the way that ... You know, free press is essential to our democracy.
And we can see from the sublime to the ridiculous that artists can capture what is going on in a way that an artist armed with just India ink and watercolor can capture and enter into the cultural dialogue.
It puts those artists at the center of that culture, and that's exactly where I think they should be.
Because the main thing we need right now is a good cartoon.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Ten years ago, computer vision researchers thought that getting a computer to tell the difference between a cat and a dog would be almost impossible, even with the significant advance in the state of artificial intelligence.
Now we can do it at a level greater than 99 percent accuracy.
This is called image classification -- give it an image, put a label to that image -- and computers know thousands of other categories as well.
I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington, and I work on a project called Darknet, which is a neural network framework for training and testing computer vision models.
So let's just see what Darknet thinks of this image that we have.
When we run our classifier on this image, we see we don't just get a prediction of dog or cat, we actually get specific breed predictions.
That's the level of granularity we have now.
And it's correct.
My dog is in fact a malamute.
So we've made amazing strides in image classification, but what happens when we run our classifier on an image that looks like this?
Well... We see that the classifier comes back with a pretty similar prediction.
And it's correct, there is a malamute in the image, but just given this label, we don't actually know that much about what's going on in the image.
We need something more powerful.
I work on a problem called object detection, where we look at an image and try to find all of the objects, put bounding boxes around them and say what those objects are.
So here's what happens when we run a detector on this image.
Now, with this kind of result, we can do a lot more with our computer vision algorithms.
We see that it knows that there's a cat and a dog.
It knows their relative locations, their size.
It may even know some extra information.
There's a book sitting in the background.
And if you want to build a system on top of computer vision, say a self-driving vehicle or a robotic system, this is the kind of information that you want.
You want something so that you can interact with the physical world.
Now, when I started working on object detection, it took 20 seconds to process a single image.
And to get a feel for why speed is so important in this domain, here's an example of an object detector that takes two seconds to process an image.
So this is 10 times faster than the 20-seconds-per-image detector, and you can see that by the time it makes predictions, the entire state of the world has changed, and this wouldn't be very useful for an application.
If we speed this up by another factor of 10, this is a detector running at five frames per second.
This is a lot better, but for example, if there's any significant movement, I wouldn't want a system like this driving my car.
This is our detection system running in real time on my laptop.
So it smoothly tracks me as I move around the frame, and it's robust to a wide variety of changes in size, pose, forward, backward. This is great. This is what we really need if we're going to build systems on top of computer vision.
(Applause)
So in just a few years, we've gone from 20 seconds per image to 20 milliseconds per image, a thousand times faster.
How did we get there? Well, in the past, object detection systems would take an image like this and split it into a bunch of regions and then run a classifier on each of these regions, and high scores for that classifier would be considered detections in the image.
But this involved running a classifier thousands of times over an image, thousands of neural network evaluations to produce detection.
Instead, we trained a single network to do all of detection for us.
It produces all of the bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously.
With our system, instead of looking at an image thousands of times to produce detection, you only look once, and that's why we call it the YOLO method of object detection.
So with this speed, we're not just limited to images; we can process video in real time.
And now, instead of just seeing that cat and dog, we can see them move around and interact with each other.
This is a detector that we trained on 80 different classes in Microsoft's COCO dataset.
It has all sorts of things like spoon and fork, bowl, common objects like that.
It has a variety of more exotic things: animals, cars, zebras, giraffes.
And now we're going to do something fun.
We're just going to go out into the audience and see what kind of things we can detect.
Does anyone want a stuffed animal?
There are some teddy bears out there.
And we can turn down our threshold for detection a little bit, so we can find more of you guys out in the audience.
Let's see if we can get these stop signs. We find some backpacks.
Let's just zoom in a little bit.
And this is great. And all of the processing is happening in real time on the laptop.
And it's important to remember that this is a general purpose object detection system, so we can train this for any image domain.
The same code that we use to find stop signs or pedestrians, bicycles in a self-driving vehicle, can be used to find cancer cells in a tissue biopsy.
And there are researchers around the globe already using this technology for advances in things like medicine, robotics.
This morning, I read a paper where they were taking a census of animals in Nairobi National Park with YOLO as part of this detection system.
And that's because Darknet is open source and in the public domain, free for anyone to use.
(Applause)
But we wanted to make detection even more accessible and usable, so through a combination of model optimization, network binarization and approximation, we actually have object detection running on a phone.
(Applause)
And I'm really excited because now we have a pretty powerful solution to this low-level computer vision problem, and anyone can take it and build something with it.
So now the rest is up to all of you and people around the world with access to this software, and I can't wait to see what people will build with this technology.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, imagine that you take a 19-hour, very long drive to Disney World, with two kids in the back seat.
And 15 minutes into this 19-hour trip, the immutable laws of nature dictate that you get the question: "Are we there yet?"
(Laughter)
So you answer this question a hundred more times, easily, in the negative, but you finally arrive.
You have a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful trip.
You drive 19 long hours back home.
And when you get there, the police are waiting on you.
They accuse you of committing a crime that occurred while you were away in Florida.
You tell anybody and everybody who will listen, "I didn't do it!
I couldn't have done it!
I was hanging out with Mickey and Minnie and my kids!" But no one believes you.
Ultimately, you're arrested, you're tried, you're convicted and you are sentenced.
And you spend 25 years in jail, until someone comes along and proves -- has the evidence to prove -- that you actually were in Florida when this crime was committed. So.
So, I'm a Harvard Law professor, and the last several years, I have worked on winning the release of innocent people who've been wrongfully convicted -- people like Jonathan Fleming, who spent 24 years, eight months in jail for a murder that was committed in Brooklyn, New York, while he was in Disney World with his kids.
How do we know this? Because when he was arrested, among his property in his back pocket was a receipt -- time-stamped receipt that showed that he was in Disney World. That receipt was put in the police file, a copy of it was put in the prosecutor's file, and they never gave it to his public defender.
In fact, nobody even knew it was there.
It just sat there for 20-some-odd years.
My team looked through the file, and we found it, did the rest of the investigation, and figured out someone else committed the crime.
Mr. Fleming was in Disney World, and he is now released.
Let me give you a little bit of context. So about three years ago, I got a call from the Brooklyn District Attorney.
He asked whether I'd be interested in designing a program called a "conviction review unit." So I said yes.
A conviction review unit is essentially a unit in a prosecutor's office where prosecutors look at their past cases to determine whether or not they made mistakes.
Over the course of the first year, we found about 13 wrongful convictions, people having been in jail for decades, and we released all of them.
It was the most in New York history.
The program is still going on, and they're up to 21 releases now -- 21 people who spent significant time behind bars.
So let me tell you about a couple other of the men and women that I interacted with in the course of this program. One name is Roger Logan.
Mr. Logan had been in jail 17 years and wrote me a letter. It was a simple letter; it basically said, "Professor Sullivan, I'm innocent.
I've been framed.
Can you look at my case?" At first blush, the case seemed like it was open and shut, but my research had shown that single-witness identification cases are prone to error.
It doesn't mean he was innocent, it just means we ought to look a little bit closer at those cases.
So we did. And the facts were relatively simple.
The eyewitness said she heard a shot, and she ran to the next building and turned around and looked, and there was Mr. Logan.
And he was tried and convicted and in jail for 17-some-odd years.
But it was a single-witness case, so we took a look at it.
I sent some people to the scene, and there was an inconsistency.
And to put it politely: Usain Bolt couldn't have run from where she said she was to the other spot. Right? So we knew that wasn't true.
So it still didn't mean that he didn't do it, but we knew something was maybe fishy about this witness.
So we looked through the file, a piece of paper in the file had a number on it.
The number indicated that this witness had a record.
We went back through 20 years of non-digitized papers to figure out what this record was about, and it turned out — it turned out — the eyewitness was in jail when she said she saw what she saw.
The man spent 17 years behind bars.
The last one is a case about two boys, Willie Stuckey, David McCallum.
They were arrested at 15, and their conviction was vacated 29 years later.
are prone to error. Now this was a case, once again -- first blush, it looked open and shut. They had confessed. But my research showed that juvenile confessions without a parent present
The DNA cases proved this several times.
So we took a close look. We looked at the confession, and it turned out, there was something in the confession that those boys could not have known.
The only people who knew it were police and prosecutors.
We knew what really happened; someone told them to say this.
We don't exactly know who, which person did, but any rate, the confession was coerced, we determined.
We then went back and did forensics and did a fulsome investigation and found that two other, much older, different heights, different hairstyle, two other people committed the crime, not these two boys.
I actually went to court that day, for what's called a "vacatur hearing," where the conviction is thrown out.
I went to court; I wanted to see Mr. McCallum walk out of there.
So I went to court, and the judge said something that judges say all the time, but this took on a really special meaning.
He looked up after the arguments and said, "Mr. McCallum," he said five beautiful words: "You are free to go." Can you imagine?
"You are free to go." After just about 30 years: And he walked out of that courtroom.
Unfortunately, his codefendant, Mr. Stuckey, didn't get the benefit of that.
You see, Mr. Stuckey died in prison at 34 years old, and his mother sat at counsel table in his place.
I'll never forget this the rest of my life.
She just rocked at the table, saying, "I knew my baby didn't do this.
"I knew my baby didn't do this. And her baby didn't do this.
Two other guys did it.
If there's anything that we've learned, anything that I've learned, with this conviction integrity work, it's that justice doesn't happen.
People make justice happen.
Justice is not a thing that just descends from above and makes everything right.
If it did, Mr. Stuckey wouldn't have died in prison.
Justice is something that people of goodwill make happen.
Justice is a decision.
Justice is a decision.
We make justice happen.
You know, the scary thing is, in each of these three cases I described, it would have only taken just an extra minute -- an extra minute -- for someone to look through the file and find this receipt.
Just one -- to look through the file, find the receipt, give it to the public defender.
It would have taken someone just a minute to look at the video confession and say, "That cannot be." Just a minute.
And perhaps Mr. Stuckey would be alive today.
It reminds me of one of my favorite poems.
It's a poem that Benjamin Elijah Mays would always recite, and he called it "God's Minute." And it goes something like this: "I have only just a minute, only 60 seconds in it, forced upon me, can't refuse it, didn't seek it, didn't choose it.
But it's up to me to use it.
I must suffer if I lose it, give account if I abuse it.
Just a tiny little minute, but eternity is in it."
If I were to charge each and every one of us, I would want to say something like, "Every day, every day, take just one extra minute and do some justice.
You don't have to — I mean, some people spend their careers and their lives, like public defenders, doing justice every day.
But in your professional lives, whatever you do, take time out to just do some justice. Make a colleague feel better.
If you hear something that's sexist, don't laugh, speak up.
If someone is down, lift them up, one extra minute each day, and it'll be a great, great place.
I want to show you something.
Now, above me is a picture of David McCallum.
This is the day he was released from prison.
After 30 years, he got to hug a niece he had never been able to touch before.
And I asked him then, I said, "What's the first thing you want to do?" And he said, "I just want to walk on the sidewalk without anybody telling me where to go." Wasn't bitter, just wanted to walk on the sidewalk.
I spoke to Mr. McCallum about two weeks ago.
I went to New York.
It was on the two-year anniversary of his release.
And we talked, we laughed, we hugged, we cried.
And he's doing quite well.
And one of the things he said when we met with him is that he now has dedicated his life and his career to ensuring that nobody else is locked up unjustly.
Justice, my friends, is a decision.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I want you to touch your face. Go on. What do you feel? Soft? Squishy? It's you, right? You're feeling you? Well, it's not quite true.
You're actually feeling thousands of microscopic creatures that live on our face and fingers.
You're feeling some of the fungi that drifted down from the air ducts today.
They set off our allergies and smell of mildew.
You're feeling some of the 100 billion bacterial cells that live on our skin.
They've been munching away at your skin oils and replicating, producing the smells of body odor.
You're likely even touching the fecal bacteria that sprayed onto you the last time you flushed a toilet, or those bacteria that live in our water pipes and sprayed onto you with your last shower. Sorry.
(Laughter)
You're probably even giving a microscopic high five to the two species of mites that live on our faces, on all of our faces.
They've spent the night squirming across your face and having sex on the bridge of your nose.
(Laughter)
Many of them are now leaking their gut contents onto your pores.
(Laughter)
Now look at your finger. How's it feel? Gross? In desperate need of soap or bleach?
That's how you feel now, but it's not going to be how you feel in the future.
For the last 100 years, we've had an adversarial relationship with the microscopic life nearest us.
If I told you there was a bug in your house or bacteria in your sink, there was a human-devised solution for that, a product to eradicate, exterminate, disinfect.
We strive to remove most of the microscopic life in our world now.
But in doing so, we're ignoring the best source of new technology on this planet.
The last 100 years have featured human solutions to microbial problems, but the next 100 years will feature microbial solutions to human problems.
I'm a scientist, and I work with researchers at North Carolina State University and the University of Colorado to uncover the microscopic life that is nearest us, and that's often in our most intimate and boring environments, be it under our couches, in our backyards, or in our belly buttons.
I do this work because it turns out that we know very little about the microscopic life that's nearest us.
As of a few years ago, no scientist could tell you what bugs or microorganisms live in your home -- your home, the place you know better than anywhere else.
And so I and teams of others are armed with Q-tips and tweezers and advanced DNA techniques to uncover the microscopic life nearest us.
In doing so, we found over 600 species of bugs that live in USA homes, everything from spiders and cockroaches to tiny mites that cling to feathers.
And we found over 100,000 species of bacteria and fungi that live in our dust bunnies, thousands more that live on our clothes or in our showers.
We've gone further still, and we looked at the microorganisms that live inside the bodies of each of those bugs in our home.
In each bug, for example, a wasp, we see a microscopic jungle unfold in a petri plate, a world of hundreds of vibrant species.
Behold the biological cosmos!
So many of the species you're looking at right now don't yet have names.
Most of the life around us remains unknown.
I remember the first time I discovered and got to name a new species.
It was a fungus that lives in the nest of a paper wasp.
It's white and fluffy, and I named it "mucor nidicola," meaning in Latin that it lives in the nest of another.
This is a picture of it growing on a dinosaur, because everyone thinks dinosaurs are cool.
At the time, I was in graduate school, and I was so excited that I had found this new life form.
I called up my dad, and I go, "Dad!
I just discovered a new microorganism species. "And he laughed and he goes," That's great.
I hope you also discovered a cure for it. "
(Laughter)
"Cure it."
Now, my dad is my biggest fan, so in that crushing moment where he wanted to kill my new little life form, I realized that actually I had failed him, both as a daughter and a scientist.
In my years toiling away in labs and in people's backyards, investigating and cataloging the microscopic life around us, I'd never made clear my true mission to him.
My goal is not to find technology to kill the new microscopic life around us. My goal is to find new technology from this life, that will help save us.
The diversity of life in our homes is more than a list of 100,000 new species.
It is 100,000 new sources of solutions to human problems.
I know it's hard to believe that anything that's so small or only has one cell can do anything powerful, but they can.
These creatures are microscopic alchemists, with the ability to transform their environment with an arsenal of chemical tools.
This means that they can live anywhere on this planet, and they can eat whatever food is around them.
This means they can eat everything from toxic waste to plastic, and they can produce waste products like oil and battery power and even tiny nuggets of real gold.
They can transform the inedible into nutritive.
They can make sugar into alcohol.
They give chocolate its flavor, and soil the power to grow.
I'm here to tell you that the next 100 years will feature these microscopic creatures solving more of our problems.
And we have a lot of problems to choose from.
We've got the mundane: bad-smelling clothes or bland food.
And we've got the monumental: disease, pollution, war.
And so this is my mission: to not just catalog the microscopic life around us, but to find out what it's uniquely well-suited to help us with.
Here's an example. We started with a pest, a wasp that lives on many of our homes.
Inside that wasp, we plucked out a little-known microorganism species with a unique ability: it could make beer.
This is a trait that only a few species on this planet have.
In fact, all commercially produced beer you've ever had likely came from one of only three microorganism species.
Yet our species, it could make a beer that tasted like honey, and it could also make a delightfully tart beer.
In fact, this microorganism species that lives in the belly of a wasp, it could make a valuable sour beer better than any other species on this planet.
There are now four species that produce commercial beer.
Where you used to see a pest, now think of tasting your future favorite beer.
As a second example, I worked with researchers to dig in the dirt in people's backyards.
There, we uncovered a microorganism that could make novel antibiotics, antibiotics that can kill the world's worst superbugs.
This was an awesome thing to find, but here's the secret: for the last 60 years, most of the antibiotics on the market have come from similar soil bacteria.
Every day, you and I and everyone in this room and on this planet, are saved by similar soil bacteria that produce most of our antibiotics.
Where you used to see dirt, now think of medication.
Perhaps my favorite example comes from colleagues who are studying a pond scum microorganism, which is tragically named after the cow dung it was first found in.
It's pretty unremarkable and would be unworthy of discussion, except that the researchers found that if you feed it to mice, it vaccinates against PTSD.
It vaccinates against fear.
Where you used to see pond scum, now think of hope.
There are so many more microbial examples that I don't have time to talk about today.
I gave you examples of solutions that came from just three species, but imagine what those other 100,000 species in your dust bunnies might be able to do.
In the future, they might be able to make you sexier or smarter or perhaps live longer.
So I want you to look at your finger again.
Think about all those microscopic creatures that are unknown.
Think about in the future what they might be able to do or make or whose life they might be able to save.
How does your finger feel right now?
A little bit powerful?
That's because you're feeling the future.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My son and the iPhone were born three weeks apart in June 2007.
So while those early adopters were lined up outside, waiting to get their hands on this amazing new gadget, I was stuck at home with my hands full of something else that was sending out constant notifications --
(Laughter)
a miserable, colicky baby who would only sleep in a moving stroller with complete silence.
I literally was walking 10 to 15 miles a day, and the baby weight came off.
That part was great.
But man, was I bored.
Before motherhood, I had been a journalist who rushed off when the Concorde crashed.
I was one of the first people into Belgrade when there was a revolution in Serbia.
Now, I was exhausted.
This walking went on for weeks.
It was only until about three months in that something shifted, though.
As I pounded the pavement, my mind started to wander, too.
I began imagining what I would do when I finally did sleep again.
So the colic did fade, and I finally got an iPhone and I put all those hours of wandering into action.
I created my dream job hosting a public radio show.
So there was no more rushing off to war zones, but thanks to my new smartphone, I could be a mother and a journalist.
I could be on the playground and on Twitter at the same time.
Yeah, well, when I thought that, when the technology came in and took over, that is when I hit a wall.
So, I want you to picture this: you host a podcast, and you have to prove that the investment of precious public radio dollars in you is worth it.
My goal was to increase my audience size tenfold.
So one day, I sat down to brainstorm, as you do, and I came up barren.
This was different than writer's block, right?
It wasn't like there was something there waiting to be unearthed.
There was just nothing.
And so I started to think back: When was the last time I actually had a good idea?
Yeah, it was when I was pushing that damn stroller.
Now all the cracks in my day were filled with phone time.
I checked the headlines while I waited for my latte.
I updated my calendar while I was sitting on the couch.
Texting turned every spare moment into a chance to show to my coworkers and my dear husband what a responsive person I was, or at least it was a chance to find another perfect couch for my page on Pinterest.
I realized that I was never bored.
And anyway, don't only boring people get bored?
But then I started to wonder: What actually happens to us when we get bored?
Or, more importantly: What happens to us if we never get bored?
And what could happen if we got rid of this human emotion entirely?
I started talking to neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists, and what they told me was fascinating.
It turns out that when you get bored, you ignite a network in your brain called the "default mode." So our body, it goes on autopilot while we're folding the laundry or we're walking to work, but actually that is when our brain gets really busy.
Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.
(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann: Once you start daydreaming and allow your mind to really wander, you start thinking a little bit beyond the conscious, a little bit into the subconscious, which allows sort of different connections to take place.
It's really awesome, actually.
Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right?
So this is my brain in an fMRI, and I learned that in the default mode is when we connect disparate ideas, we solve some of our most nagging problems, and we do something called "autobiographical planning." This is when we look back at our lives, we take note of the big moments, we create a personal narrative, and then we set goals and we figure out what steps we need to take to reach them.
But now we chill out on the couch also while updating a Google Doc or replying to email.
We call it "getting shit done," but here's what neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Levitin says we're actually doing.
(Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin: Every time you shift your attention from one thing to another, the brain has to engage a neurochemical switch that uses up nutrients in the brain to accomplish that.
So if you're attempting to multitask, you know, doing four or five things at once, you're not actually doing four or five things at once, because the brain doesn't work that way.
Instead, you're rapidly shifting from one thing to the next, depleting neural resources as you go.
(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch, you're using glucose, glucose, glucose.
(Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have a limited supply of that stuff.
MZ: A decade ago, we shifted our attention at work every three minutes.
Now we do it every 45 seconds, and we do it all day long.
The average person checks email 74 times a day, and switches tasks on their computer 566 times a day.
I discovered all this talking to professor of informatics, Dr. Gloria Mark.
(Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find that when people are stressed, they tend to shift their attention more rapidly.
We also found, strangely enough, that the shorter the amount of sleep that a person gets, the more likely they are to check Facebook.
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.
MZ: But could this cycle be broken?
What would happen if we broke this vicious cycle?
Maybe my listeners could help me find out.
What if we reclaimed those cracks in our day?
Could it help us jump-start our creativity?
We called the project "Bored and Brilliant." And I expected, you know, a couple hundred people to play along, but thousands of people started signing up.
And they told me the reason they were doing it was because they were worried that their relationship with their phone had grown kind of ... "codependent," shall we say.
(Audio) Man: The relationship between a baby and its teddy bear or a baby and its binky or a baby that wants its mother's cradle when it's done with being held by a stranger --
(Laughs)
that's the relationship between me and my phone.
(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone like a power tool: extremely useful, but dangerous if I'm not handling it properly.
(Audio) Woman 2: If I don't pay close attention, I'll suddenly realize that I've lost an hour of time doing something totally mindless.
MZ: OK, but to really measure any improvement, we needed data, right?
Because that's what we do these days.
So we partnered with some apps that would measure how much time we were spending every day on our phone.
If you're thinking it's ironic that I asked people to download another app so that they would spend less time on their phones: yeah, but you gotta meet people where they are.
(Laughter)
So before challenge week, we were averaging two hours a day on our phones and 60 pickups, you know, like, a quick check, did I get a new email?
Here's what Tina, a student at Bard College, discovered about herself.
(Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending between 150 and 200 minutes on my phone per day, and I've been picking up my phone 70 to 100 times per day.
And it's really concerning, because that's so much time that I could have spent doing something more productive, more creative, more towards myself, because when I'm on my phone, I'm not doing anything important.
MZ: Like Tina, people were starting to observe their own behavior.
They were getting ready for challenge week.
And that Monday, they started to wake up to instructions in their inbox, an experiment to try.
Day one: "Put it in your pocket." Take that phone out of your hand.
See if you can eliminate the reflex to check it all day long, just for a day.
And if this sounds easy, you haven't tried it.
Here's listener Amanda Itzko.
(Audio) Amanda Itzko: I am absolutely itching.
I feel a little bit crazy, because I have noticed that I pick up my phone when I'm just walking from one room to another, getting on the elevator, and even -- and this is the part that I am really embarrassed to actually say out loud -- in the car.
MZ: Yikes. Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned, this itching feeling is not actually her fault.
That is exactly the behavior that the technology is built to trigger.
(Laughter)
I mean, right? Here's former Google designer, Tristan Harris.
(Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebook or I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat, I have literally a thousand engineers whose job is to get more attention from you.
I'm very good at this, and I don't want you to ever stop.
And you know, the CEO of Netflix recently said, "Our biggest competitors are Facebook, YouTube and sleep." I mean, so there's a million places to spend your attention, but there's a war going on to get it.
MZ: I mean, you know the feeling: that amazing episode of "Transparent" ends, and then the next one starts playing so you're like, eh, OK fine, I'll just stay up and watch it. Or the LinkedIn progress bar says you are this close to having the perfect profile, so you add a little more personal information.
As one UX designer told me, the only people who refer to their customers as "users" are drug dealers and technologists.
(Laughter)
And users, as we know, are worth a lot of money.
Here's former Facebook product manager and author, Antonio García Martínez.
(Audio) Antonio García Martínez: The saying is, if any product is free then you're the product; your attention is the product.
But what is your attention worth?
That's why literally every time you load a page, not just on Facebook or any app, there's an auction being held instantly, billions of times a day, for exactly how much that one ad impression cost.
MZ: By the way, the average person will spend two years of their life on Facebook. So, back to challenge week. Immediately, we saw some creativity kick in.
Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert.
(Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess.
So I suddenly looked at the stairway that went up to the top of the station, and I thought, you know, I had just come down that stairway, but I could go back up and then come back down and get a little cardio.
So I did, and then I had a little more time, so I did it again and I did it again, and I did it 10 times.
And I had a complete cardio workout.
I got on that R train feeling kind of exhausted, but, like, wow, that had never occurred to me. How is that possible?
MZ: So creativity, I learned, means different things to different people.
(Laughter)
But everyone found day three's challenge the hardest.
It was called "Delete that app." Take that app -- you know the one; that one that always gets you, it sucks you in -- take it off your phone, even if just for the day.
I deleted the game Two Dots and nearly cried.
(Laughter)
Yeah, Two Dots players know what I'm talking about.
But my misery had good company.
(Audio) Man 2: This is Liam in Los Angeles, and I deleted Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine from my phone in one fell swoop.
And it was kind of an embarrassingly emotional experience at first.
It felt weirdly lonely to look at that lock screen with no new notifications on it.
But I really liked deciding for myself when to think about or access my social networks, not giving my phone the power to decide that for me. So thank you.
(Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter app was very sad, and I feel I maybe, over the last year when I've been on Twitter, have developed an addiction to it, and this "Bored and Brilliant" challenge has really made me realize it.
After a brief period of really horrible withdrawal feeling, like lack-of-caffeine headache, I now feel lovely.
I had a lovely dinner with my family, and I hope to continue this structured use of these powerful tools.
(Audio) Woman 4: I don't have that guilty gut feeling I have when I know I'm wasting time on my phone.
Maybe I'll have to start giving myself challenges and reminders like this every morning.
MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress.
I could not wait to see what the numbers said at the end of that week.
But when the data came in, it turned out that we had cut down, on average, just six minutes -- from 120 minutes a day on our phones to 114. Yeah. Whoop-de-do.
So I went back to the scientists feeling kind of low, and they just laughed at me, and they said, you know, changing people's behavior in such a short time period was ridiculously ambitious, and actually what you've achieved is far beyond what we thought possible.
Because more important than the numbers, were the people's stories. They felt empowered. Their phones had been transformed from taskmasters back into tools.
And actually, I found what the young people said most intriguing.
Some of them told me that they didn't recognize some of the emotions that they felt during challenge week, because, if you think about it, if you have never known life without connectivity, you may never have experienced boredom.
And there could be consequences.
Researchers at USC have found -- they're studying teenagers who are on social media while they're talking to their friends or they're doing homework, and two years down the road, they are less creative and imaginative about their own personal futures and about solving societal problems, like violence in their neighborhoods.
And we really need this next generation to be able to focus on some big problems: climate change, economic disparity, massive cultural differences.
No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey identified creativity as the number one leadership competency.
OK, here's the good news, though: In the end, 20,000 people did "Bored and Brilliant" that week.
Ninety percent cut down on their minutes.
Seventy percent got more time to think.
People told me that they slept better. They felt happier. My favorite note was from a guy who said he felt like he was waking up from a mental hibernation.
Some personal data and some neuroscience gave us permission to be offline a little bit more, and a little bit of boredom gave us some clarity and helped some of us set some goals.
I mean, maybe constant connectivity won't be cool in a couple of years.
But meanwhile, teaching people, especially kids, how to use technology to improve their lives and to self-regulate needs to be part of digital literacy.
So the next time you go to check your phone, remember that if you don't decide how you're going to use the technology, the platforms will decide for you.
And ask yourself: What am I really looking for?
Because if it's to check email, that's fine -- do it and be done.
But if it's to distract yourself from doing the hard work that comes with deeper thinking, take a break, stare out the window and know that by doing nothing you are actually being your most productive and creative self.
It might feel weird and uncomfortable at first, but boredom truly can lead to brilliance.
Thank you.

How many companies have you interacted with today?
Well, you got up in the morning, took a shower, washed your hair, used a hair dryer, ate breakfast -- ate cereals, fruit, yogurt, whatever -- had coffee -- tea.
You took public transport to come here, or maybe used your private car.
You interacted with the company that you work for or that you own.
You interacted with your clients, your customers, and so on and so forth.
I'm pretty sure there are at least seven companies you've interacted with today.
Let me tell you a stunning statistic.
One out of seven large, public corporations commit fraud every year.
This is a US academic study that looks at US companies -- I have no reason to believe that it's different in Europe.
This is a study that looks at both detected and undetected fraud using statistical methods.
This is not petty fraud.
These frauds cost the shareholders of these companies, and therefore society, on the order of 380 billion dollars per year.
We can all think of some examples, right?
The car industry's secrets aren't quite so secret anymore.
Fraud has become a feature, not a bug, of the financial services industry.
That's not me who's claiming that, that's the president of the American Finance Association who stated that in his presidential address.
That's a huge problem if you think about, especially, an economy like Switzerland, which relies so much on the trust put into its financial industry.
On the other hand, there are six out of seven companies who actually remain honest despite all temptations to start engaging in fraud.
There are whistle-blowers like Michael Woodford, who blew the whistle on Olympus.
These whistle-blowers risk their careers, their friendships, to bring out the truth about their companies.
There are journalists like Anna Politkovskaya who risk even their lives to report human rights violations.
She got killed -- every year, around 100 journalists get killed because of their conviction to bring out the truth.
So in my talk today, I want to share with you some insights I've obtained and learned in the last 10 years of conducting research in this.
I'm a researcher, a scientist working with economists, financial economists, ethicists, neuroscientists, lawyers and others trying to understand what makes humans tick, and how can we address this issue of fraud in corporations and therefore contribute to the improvement of the world.
I want to start by sharing with you two very distinct visions of how people behave.
First, meet Adam Smith, founding father of modern economics.
His basic idea was that if everybody behaves in their own self-interests, that's good for everybody in the end.
Self-interest isn't a narrowly defined concept just for your immediate utility.
It has a long-run implication. Let's think about that.
Think about this dog here.
That might be us.
There's this temptation -- I apologize to all vegetarians, but --
(Laughter)
Dogs do like the bratwurst.
(Laughter) Now, the straight-up, self-interested move here is to go for that.
So my friend Adam here might jump up, get the sausage and thereby ruin all this beautiful tableware.
But that's not what Adam Smith meant.
He didn't mean disregard all consequences -- to the contrary.
He would have thought, well, there may be negative consequences, for example, the owner might be angry with the dog and the dog, anticipating that, might not behave in this way.
That might be us. weighing the benefits and costs of our actions.
How does that play out?
Well, many of you, I'm sure, have in your companies, especially if it's a large company, a code of conduct.
And then if you behave according to that code of conduct, that improves your chances of getting a bonus payment.
And on the other hand, if you disregard it, then there are higher chances of not getting your bonus or its being diminished.
In other words, this is a very economic motivation of trying to get people to be more honest, or more aligned with the corporation's principles.
Similarly, reputation is a very powerful economic force, right?
We try to build a reputation, maybe for being honest, because then people trust us more in the future. Right? Adam Smith talked about the baker who's not producing good bread out of his benevolence for those people who consume the bread, but because he wants to sell more future bread.
In my research, we find, for example, at the University of Zurich, that Swiss banks who get caught up in media, and in the context, for example, of tax evasion, of tax fraud, have bad media coverage.
They lose net new money in the future and therefore make lower profits.
That's a very powerful reputational force. Benefits and costs.
Here's another viewpoint of the world.
Meet Immanuel Kant, 18th-century German philosopher superstar.
He developed this notion that independent of the consequences, some actions are just right and some are just wrong.
It's just wrong to lie, for example.
So, meet my friend Immanuel here.
He knows that the sausage is very tasty, but he's going to turn away because he's a good dog.
He knows it's wrong to jump up and risk ruining all this beautiful tableware.
If you believe that people are motivated like that, then all the stuff about incentives, all the stuff about code of conduct and bonus systems and so on, doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
People are motivated by different values perhaps.
So, what are people actually motivated by?
These two gentlemen here have perfect hairdos, but they give us very different views of the world.
What do we do with this?
Well, I'm an economist and we conduct so-called experiments to address this issue.
We strip away facts which are confusing in reality.
Reality is so rich, there is so much going on, it's almost impossible to know what drives people's behavior really.
So let's do a little experiment together.
Imagine the following situation.
You're in a room alone, not like here.
There's a five-franc coin like the one I'm holding up right now in front of you.
Here are your instructions: toss the coin four times, and then on a computer terminal in front of you, enter the number of times tails came up.
This is the situation.
Here's the rub.
For every time that you announce that you had a tails throw, you get paid five francs.
So if you say I had two tails throws, you get paid 10 francs.
If you say you had zero, you get paid zero francs.
If you say, "I had four tails throws," then you get paid 20 francs.
It's anonymous, nobody's watching what you're doing, and you get paid that money anonymously.
I've got two questions for you.
You know what's coming now, right?
First, how would you behave in that situation?
The second, look to your left and look to your right --
and think about how the person sitting next to you might behave in that situation.
We did this experiment for real.
We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition that took place here in Zurich recently, not with students in the lab at the university but with the real population, like you guys.
First, a quick reminder of stats.
If I throw the coin four times and it's a fair coin, then the probability that it comes up four times tails is 6.25 percent.
And I hope you can intuitively see that the probability that all four of them are tails is much lower than if two of them are tails, right?
Here are the specific numbers. Here's what happened.
People did this experiment for real.
Around 30 to 35 percent of people said, "Well, I had four tails throws." That's extremely unlikely.
(Laughter)
But the really amazing thing here, perhaps to an economist, is there are around 65 percent of people who did not say I had four tails throws, even though in that situation, nobody's watching you, the only consequence that's in place is you get more money if you say four than less.
You leave 20 francs on the table by announcing zero.
I don't know whether the other people all were honest or whether they also said a little bit higher or lower than what they did because it's anonymous.
We only observed the distribution.
But what I can tell you -- and here's another coin toss. There you go, it's tails.
(Laughter)
Don't check, OK?
(Laughter)
What I can tell you is that not everybody behaved like Adam Smith would have predicted.
So what does that leave us with?
Well, it seems people are motivated by certain intrinsic values and in our research, we look at this.
We look at the idea that people have so-called protected values.
A protected value isn't just any value.
A protected value is a value where you're willing to pay a price to uphold that value.
You're willing to pay a price to withstand the temptation to give in.
And the consequence is you feel better if you earn money in a way that's consistent with your values.
Let me show you this again in the metaphor of our beloved dog here.
If we succeed in getting the sausage without violating our values, then the sausage tastes better.
That's what our research shows.
If, on the other hand, we do so -- if we get the sausage and in doing so we actually violate values, we value the sausage less.
Quantitatively, that's quite powerful.
for example, We can measure these protected values, by a survey measure.
Simple, nine-item survey that's quite predictive in these experiments.
If you think about the average of the population and then there's a distribution around it -- people are different, we all are different.
People who have a set of protected values that's one standard deviation above the average, they discount money they receive by lying by about 25 percent.
That means a dollar received when lying is worth to them only 75 cents without any incentives you put in place for them to behave honestly.
It's their intrinsic motivation.
By the way, I'm not a moral authority. I'm not saying I have all these beautiful values, right?
But I'm interested in how people behave and how we can leverage that richness in human nature to actually improve the workings of our organizations.
So there are two very, very different visions here.
On the one hand, you can appeal to benefits and costs and try to get people to behave according to them.
On the other hand, you can select people who have the values and the desirable characteristics, of course -- competencies that go in line with your organization.
I do not yet know where these protected values really come from.
Is it nurture or is it nature?
What I can tell you is that the distribution looks pretty similar for men and women.
It looks pretty similar for those who had studied economics or those who had studied psychology.
It looks even pretty similar around different age categories among adults.
But I don't know yet how this develops over a lifetime.
That will be the subject of future research.
The idea I want to leave you with is it's all right to appeal to incentives. I'm an economist; I certainly believe in the fact that incentives work.
But do think about selecting the right people rather than having people and then putting incentives in place.
Selecting the right people with the right values may go a long way to saving a lot of trouble and a lot of money in your organizations.
In other words, it will pay off to put people first.
Thank you.
(Applause)
It's 1878. Sir Francis Galton gives a remarkable talk.
He's speaking to the anthropologic institute of Great Britain and Ireland.
Known for his pioneering work in human intelligence, Galton is a brilliant polymath. He's an explorer, an anthropologist, a sociologist, a psychologist and a statistician.
He's also a eugenist.
In this talk, he presents a new technique by which he can combine photographs and produce composite portraits.
This technique could be used to characterize different types of people.
Galton thinks that if he combines photographs of violent criminals, he will discover the face of criminality.
But to his surprise, the composite portrait that he produces is beautiful.
Galton's surprising finding raises deep questions: What is beauty?
Why do certain configurations of line and color and form excite us so?
For most of human history, these questions have been approached using logic and speculation.
But in the last few decades, scientists have addressed the question of beauty using ideas from evolutionary psychology and tools of neuroscience.
We're beginning to glimpse the why and the how of beauty, at least in terms of what it means for the human face and form.
And in the process, we're stumbling upon some surprises.
When it comes to seeing beauty in each other, while this decision is certainly subjective for the individual, it's sculpted by factors that contribute to the survival of the group.
Many experiments have shown that a few basic parameters contribute to what makes a face attractive.
These include averaging, symmetry and the effects of hormones.
Let's take each one of these in turn.
Galton's finding that composite or average faces are typically more attractive than each individual face that contributes to the average has been replicated many times.
This laboratory finding fits with many people's intuitions.
Average faces represent the central tendencies of a group.
People with mixed features represent different populations, and presumably harbor greater genetic diversity and adaptability to the environment.
Many people find mixed-race individuals attractive and inbred families less so.
The second factor that contributes to beauty is symmetry.
People generally find symmetric faces more attractive than asymmetric ones.
Developmental abnormalities are often associated with asymmetries.
And in plants, animals and humans, asymmetries often arise from parasitic infections.
Symmetry, it turns out, is also an indicator of health.
In the 1930s, a man named Maksymilian Faktorowicz recognized the importance of symmetry for beauty when he designed the beauty micrometer.
With this device, he could measure minor asymmetric flaws which he could then make up for with products he sold from his company, named brilliantly after himself, Max Factor, which, as you know, is one of the world's most famous brands for "make up."
The third factor that contributes to facial attractiveness is the effect of hormones.
And here, I need to apologize for confining my comments to heterosexual norms.
But estrogen and testosterone play important roles in shaping features that we find attractive.
Estrogen produces features that signal fertility.
Men typically find women attractive who have elements of both youth and maturity.
A face that's too baby-like might mean that the girl is not yet fertile, so men find women attractive who have large eyes, full lips and narrow chins as indicators of youth, and high cheekbones as an indicator of maturity.
Testosterone produces features that we regard as typically masculine.
These include heavier brows, thinner cheeks and bigger, squared-off jaws.
But here's a fascinating irony.
In many species, if anything, testosterone suppresses the immune system.
So the idea that testosterone-infused features are a fitness indicator doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.
Here, the logic is turned on its head.
Instead of a fitness indicator, scientists invoke a handicap principle.
The most commonly cited example of a handicap is the peacock's tail.
This beautiful but cumbersome tail doesn't exactly help the peacock avoid predators and approach peahens.
Why should such an extravagant appendage evolve?
Even Charles Darwin, in an 1860 letter to Asa Gray wrote that the sight of the peacock's tail made him physically ill.
He couldn't explain it with his theory of natural selection, and out of this frustration, he developed the theory of sexual selection.
On this account, the display of the peacock's tail is about sexual enticement, and this enticement means it's more likely the peacock will mate and have offspring.
Now, the modern twist on this display argument is that the peacock is also advertising its health to the peahen.
Only especially fit organisms can afford to divert resources to maintaining such an extravagant appendage.
Only especially fit men can afford the price that testosterone levies on their immune system.
And by analogy, think of the fact that only very rich men can afford to pay more than $10,000 for a watch as a display of their financial fitness.
Now, many people hear these kinds of evolutionary claims and think they mean that we somehow are unconsciously seeking mates who are healthy.
And I think this idea is probably not right.
Teenagers and young adults are not exactly known for making decisions that are predicated on health concerns.
But they don't have to be, and let me explain why.
Imagine a population in which people have three different kinds of preferences: for green, for orange and for red.
From their point of view, these preferences have nothing to do with health; they just like what they like.
But if it were also the case that these preferences are associated with the different likelihood of producing offspring — let's say in a ratio of 3: 2: 1 — then in the first generation, there would be 3 greens to 2 oranges to 1 red, and in each subsequent generation, the proportion of greens increase, so that in 10 generations, 98 percent of this population has a green preference.
Now, a scientist coming in and sampling this population discovers that green preferences are universal.
So the point about this little abstract example is that while preferences for specific physical features can be arbitrary for the individual, if those features are heritable and they are associated with a reproductive advantage, over time, they become universal for the group.
So what happens in the brain when we see beautiful people?
Attractive faces activate parts of our visual cortex in the back of the brain, an area called the fusiform gyrus, that is especially tuned to processing faces, and an adjacent area called the lateral occipital complex, that is especially attuned to processing objects.
In addition, attractive faces activate parts of our reward and pleasure centers in the front and deep in the brain, and these include areas that have complicated names, like the ventral striatum, the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex.
Our visual brain that is tuned to processing faces interacts with our pleasure centers to underpin the experience of beauty.
Amazingly, while we all engage with beauty, without our knowledge, beauty also engages us.
Our brains respond to attractive faces even when we're not thinking about beauty.
We conducted an experiment in which people saw a series of faces, and in one condition, they had to decide if a pair of faces were the same or a different person.
Even in this condition, attractive faces drove neural activity robustly in their visual cortex, despite the fact that they were thinking about a person's identity and not their beauty.
Another group similarly found automatic responses to beauty within our pleasure centers.
Taken together, these studies suggest that our brain automatically responds to beauty by linking vision and pleasure.
These beauty detectors, it seems, ping every time we see beauty, regardless of whatever else we might be thinking.
We also have a "beauty is good" stereotype embedded in the brain.
Within the orbitofrontal cortex, there's overlapping neural activity in response to beauty and to goodness, and this happens even when people aren't explicitly thinking about beauty or goodness.
Our brains seem to reflexively associate beauty and good.
And this reflexive association may be the biologic trigger for the many social effects of beauty.
Attractive people receive all kinds of advantages in life.
They're regarded as more intelligent, more trustworthy, they're given higher pay and lesser punishments, even when such judgments are not warranted.
These kinds of observations reveal beauty's ugly side.
In my lab, we recently found that people with minor facial anomalies and disfigurements are regarded as less good, less kind, less intelligent, less competent and less hardworking.
Unfortunately, we also have a "disfigured is bad" stereotype.
This stereotype is probably exploited and magnified by images in popular media, in which facial disfigurement is often used as a shorthand to depict someone of villainous character.
We need to understand these kinds of implicit biases if we are to overcome them and aim for a society in which we treat people fairly, based on their behavior and not on the happenstance of their looks.
Let me leave you with one final thought.
Beauty is a work in progress.
The so-called universal attributes of beauty were selected for during the almost two million years of the Pleistocene.
Life was nasty, brutish and a very long time ago.
The selection criteria for reproductive success from that time doesn't really apply today.
For example, death by parasite is not one of the top ways that people die, at least not in the technologically developed world.
From antibiotics to surgery, birth control to in vitro fertilization, the filters for reproductive success are being relaxed.
And under these relaxed conditions, preference and trait combinations are free to drift and become more variable.
Even as we are profoundly affecting our environment, modern medicine and technological innovation is profoundly affecting the very essence of what it means to look beautiful.
The universal nature of beauty is changing even as we're changing the universe.
Thank you. (Applause)
So, I'm afraid. Right now, on this stage, I feel fear.
In my life, I ain't met many people that will readily admit when they are afraid.
And I think that's because deep down, they know how easy it spreads.
See, fear is like a disease.
When it moves, it moves like wildfire.
But what happens when, even in the face of that fear, you do what you've got to do?
That's called courage.
And just like fear, courage is contagious.
See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.
That's a small city across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, Missouri.
I have lived in and around St. Louis my entire life.
When Michael Brown, Jr., an ordinary teenager, was gunned down by police in 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri -- another suburb, but north of St. Louis -- I remember thinking, he ain't the first, and he won't be the last young kid to lose his life to law enforcement.
But see, his death was different.
When Mike was killed, I remember the powers that be trying to use fear as a weapon.
The police response to a community in mourning was to use force to impose fear: fear of militarized police, imprisonment, fines.
The media even tried to make us afraid of each other by the way they spun the story.
And all of these things have worked in the past.
But like I said, this time it was different.
Michael Brown's death and the subsequent treatment of the community led to a string of protests in and around Ferguson and St. Louis. When I got out to those protests about the fourth or fifth day, it was not out of courage; it was out of guilt.
See, I'm black.
I don't know if y'all noticed that. (Laughter)
But I couldn't sit in St. Louis, minutes away from Ferguson, and not go see.
So I got off my ass to go check it out.
When I got out there, I found something surprising.
I found anger; there was a lot of that.
But what I found more of was love.
People with love for themselves.
Love for their community.
And it was beautiful -- until the police showed up.
Then a new emotion was interjected into the conversation: fear.
Now, I'm not going to lie; when I saw those armored vehicles, and all that gear and all those guns and all those police I was terrified -- personally.
And when I looked around that crowd, I saw a lot of people that had the same thing going on.
But I also saw people with something else inside of them. That was courage. See, those people yelled, and they screamed, and they were not about to back down from the police.
They were past that point.
And then I could feel something in me changing, so I yelled and I screamed, and I noticed that everybody around me was doing the same thing.
And there was nothing like that feeling.
So I decided I wanted to do something more.
I went home, I thought: I'm an artist. I make shit. So I started making things specific to the protest, things that would be weapons in a spiritual war, things that would give people voice and things that would fortify them for the road ahead.
I did a project where I took pictures of the hands of protesters and put them up and down the boarded-up buildings and community shops.
My goal was to raise awareness and to raise the morale.
And I think, for a minute at least, it did just that.
Then I thought, I want to uplift the stories of these people I was watching being courageous in the moment.
And myself and my friend, and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan did just that with our documentary, "Whose Streets?"
I kind of became a conduit for all of this courage that was given to me.
And I think that's part of our job as artists.
I think we should be conveyors of courage in the work that we do.
And I think that we are the wall between the normal folks and the people that use their power to spread fear and hate, especially in times like these.
So I'm going to ask you. Y'all the movers and the shakers, you know, the thought leaders: What are you gonna do with the gifts that you've been given to break us from the fear the binds us every day?
Because, see, I'm afraid every day.
I can't remember a time when I wasn't.
But once I figured out that fear was not put in me to cripple me, it was there to protect me, and once I figured out how to use that fear, I found my power.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi everyone. So, I'm going to take us back to 2007.
I'd just spent about six months working on album that I'd poured my heart and my soul into, and it was getting about three plays per day on Myspace at the time, and I was getting more and more depressed when I started noticing these other people who were playing guitar and singing and putting videos on this new site called YouTube, and they were getting 300,000 views.
So I decided I'm going to start making some Youtube videos.
And one day they featured a video of my band on the homepage, which was amazing — we got a bunch of new fans.
We also got a bunch of people who, I guess, just didn't really like the music or something — (Laughter) It's OK because people started coming to our shows, and we started touring, and we came out with a record.
And when I checked our bank account balance after our first monthly iTunes payout, we had 22,000 bucks in it, which was amazing because at the time I was living at my dad's house, trying to make a living as a musician by uploading videos to the internet which literally zero people respected in 2009 — even the people who were uploading videos to the internet.
And so for the next four years, I uploaded more and more videos to the Internet, and they got better and better, and we made enough money through brand deals and commercials and iTunes sales to buy a house.
And we built a recording studio.
But there was one big problem: making money as a creative person in 2013 was super weird.
First of all, the business models were changing all the time.
So our 58,000 dollars of annual iTunes download income was about to be replaced by about 6,000 dollars of streaming income.
Steams paid less than downloads.
And then as more and more creators started popping up online, there was just more competition for these five-figure brand deals that had kept the band afloat for years.
And to top it all off, our videos themselves -- the creative stuff that we made that our fans loved and appreciated -- that were actually contributing value to the world, those videos were generating almost zero dollars of income for us.
This is an actual snapshot of my YouTube dashboard from a 28-day period that shows one million views and 166 dollars of ad earnings for those views.
The whole machine in 2013 that took art online and outputted money was totally nonfunctional.
It doesn't matter if you're a newspaper, or an institution, or an independent creator.
A monthly web comic with 20,000 monthly readers -- 20,000 monthly readers -- gets paid a couple hundred bucks in ad revenue.
This is 20,000 people.
Like, in what world is this not enough?
I don't understand.
What systems have we built where this is insufficient for a person to make a living?
So, I actually have a theory about this.
(Laughter) I think it's been a weird 100 years. (Applause) About 100 years ago, humans figured out how to record sound onto a wax cylinder.
That was the beginning of the phonograph.
Right around the same time, we figured out how to record light onto a piece of photographic paper, celluloid -- the beginning of film and television.
For the first time, you could store art on a thing, which was amazing.
Art used to be completely ephemeral, so if you missed the symphony, you just didn't get to hear the orchestra.
which was amazing. But now, for the first time, you could store the orchestra's performance on a physical object, and like, listen to it later,
It was so amazing in fact, that for the next 100 years, between 1900 and 2000, humans built just billions and billions of dollars of infrastructure to essentially help artists do two things.
First, put their art on a thing, and second, get that thing around the world to the people who wanted the art.
So, so much industry is devoted to these two problems. Oh my gosh, there are trucking companies, and brick-and-mortar and marketing firms, and CD jewel case manufacturers, all devoted to these two problems.
And then we all know what happened.
10 years ago, the internet matures and we get Spotify and Facebook and YouTube and iTunes and Google search, and a hundred years of infrastructure and supply chains and distribution systems and monetization schemes are completely bypassed -- in a decade.
After 100 years of designing these things, it's no wonder that it's just totally broken for creative people right now.
It's no wonder that the monetization part of the chain doesn't work given this new context.
But what gets me super excited to be a creator right now, to be alive today and be a creative person right now, is realizing that we're only 10 years into figuring out this new machine -- to figuring out the next 100 years of infrastructure for our creators.
And you can tell we're only 10 years in.
There's a lot of trial and error, some really good ideas forming, a lot of experimentation.
We're figuring out what works and what doesn't. Like Twitch streamers. Who's heard of Twitch?
Twitch streamers are making three to five thousand bucks a month streaming gaming content.
The big ones are making over 100,000 dollars a year.
There's a site called YouNow, it's an app.
It allows musicians and vloggers to get paid in digital goods from fans.
So, I'm also working on the problem.
Four years ago I started a company called Patreon with a friend of mine.
We're 80 people now working on this problem.
It's basically a membership platform that makes it really easy for creators to get paid -- every month from their fans to earn a living.
For a creator, it's like having a salary for being a creative person.
And this is one of our creators.
They're called "Kinda Funny." They have about 220,000 subscribers on YouTube.
And when they upload a video, it gets somewhere around 15,000 views to 100,000 views.
I want you to check yourselves right now.
I think when we hear numbers like that, when we hear "15,000 views," and we see content like this, we just snap categorize it as being not as legitimate as a morning show that you'd hear on the radio or a talk show that you'd see on NBC or something But when "Kinda Funny" launched on Patreon, within a few weeks, they were making 31,000 dollars per month for this show.
It took off so fast that they decided to expand their programming and add new shows, and now they launched a second Patreon page -- they're making an additional 21,000 dollars per month.
And they're scaling what's essentially becoming a media company, financing the whole thing through membership.
OK, here's another example.
This is Derek Bodner, a sports journalist who used to write for Philadelphia Magazine until a few months ago when the magazine cut out all sports coverage.
Now he writes articles and publishes them on his own website -- he's still covering sports, but for himself.
And he's making 4,800 bucks a month from 1,700 patrons, financing it through membership.
This is Crash Course -- free educational content for the world.
This show is actually on the PBS digital network -- 29,000 dollars per month.
This is a duo sailing around the world, getting paid every month for documenting their travels from 1,400 patrons.
This is a podcast, "Chapo Trap House", making -- actually, since I screenshotted this, they're making an additional 2,000 dollars per month, so they're now making 56,000 dollars per month for their podcast.
And Patreon's not the only one working on the problem.
Even Google's starting to work on this.
A couple years ago, they launched Fan Funding; more recently, they launched Super Chat as a way for creators to monetize live streaming.
Newspapers are starting to experiment with membership.
New York Times has a membership program; The Guardian has over 200,000 paying subscribers to its membership program.
There's this bubbling soup of ideas and experiments and progress right now, and it's pointing in the direction of getting creators paid. And it's working. It's not, like, perfect yet, but it's really working.
So, Patreon has over 50,000 creators on the platform making salaries -- getting paid every month for putting art online, for being a creative person.
The next hundred years of infrastructure is on the way and it's going to be different this time because of this -- because of the direct connection between the person who makes the thing and the person who likes the thing.
About seven or eight years ago, I went to a cocktail party.
This is when the band had hit our first machine, so things were really cranking.
We had just made about 400,000 dollars in one year through iTunes sales and brand deals and stuff like that.
And this guy comes up to me and says, "Hey, Jack, what do you do?" I said, "I'm a musician." And he just sobered up immediately, and he stuck out his hand, put a hand on my shoulder, and in a real earnest, very nice voice he was like, "I hope you make it someday." (Laughter) And... I have so many moments like that logged in my memory.
I just cringe thinking of that.
It's so embarrassing to just not feel valued as a creative person.
But as a species, we are leaving that cocktail party behind.
We're leaving that culture, we're out of there.
We're going to get so good at paying creators, within 10 years, kids graduating high school and college are going to think of being a creator as just being an option -- I could be a doctor, I could be a lawyer, I could be a podcaster, I could have a web comic.
It's just going to be something you can do. We're figuring it out. It's going to be a viable and sustainable and respected profession.
Creators are going to come out the other end of this weird 100 years, this century-long journey, with an awesome new machine.
And they're going to be paid, and they're going to be valued. Thanks, everybody.
(Applause) I think it went pretty well.
I want artists who saw that to not give up -- to know that we're getting there.
It's not there yet, but in a couple years, there will be so many systems and tools for them to just make a living online, and if they've got a podcast that's starting to take off, but they're not able to make money on it yet, that's happening and they're going to be paid. It's happening.
So, let me add to the complexity of the situation we find ourselves in.
At the same time that we're solving for climate change, we're going to be building cities for three billion people. That's a doubling of the urban environment.
If we don't get that right, I'm not sure all the climate solutions in the world will save mankind, because so much depends on how we shape our cities: not just environmental impacts, but our social well-being, our economic vitality, our sense of community and connectedness.
Fundamentally, the way we shape cities is a manifestation of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.
And so getting it right is, I think, the order of the day.
And to a certain degree, getting it right can help us solve climate change, because in the end, it's our behavior that seems to be driving the problem.
The problem isn't free-floating, and it isn't just ExxonMobil and oil companies.
It's us; how we live. How we live.
There's a villain in this story.
It's called sprawl, and I'll be upfront about that.
But it's not just the kind of sprawl you think of, or many people think of, as low-density development out at the periphery of the metropolitan area.
Actually, I think sprawl can happen anywhere, at any density.
The key attribute is that it isolates people.
It segregates people into economic enclaves and land-use enclaves.
It separates them from nature.
It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization, the interaction, that make cities great places and that make society thrive.
So the antidote to sprawl is really what we all need to be thinking about, especially when we're taking on this massive construction project.
So let me take you through one exercise. We developed the model for the state of California so they could get on with reducing carbon emissions.
We did a whole series of scenarios for how the state could grow, and this is just one overly simplified one.
We mixed different development prototypes and said they're going to carry us through the year 2050, 10 million new crew in our state of California.
And one was sprawl.
It's just more of the same: shopping malls, subdivisions, office parks.
The other one was dominated by, not everybody moving to the city, but just compact development, what we used to think of as streetcar suburbs, walkable neighborhoods, low-rise, but integrated, mixed-used environments.
And the results are astounding.
They're astounding not just for the scale of the difference of this one shift in our city-making habit but also because each one represents a special interest group, a special interest group that used to advocate for their concerns one at a time.
They did not see the, what I call, "co-benefits" of urban form that allows them to join with others.
So, land consumption: environmentalists are really concerned about this, so are farmers; there's a whole range of people, and, of course, neighborhood groups that want open space nearby.
The sprawl version of California almost doubles the urban physical footprint.
Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings, because in California, our biggest carbon emission comes from cars, and cities that don't depend on cars as much obviously create huge savings.
Vehicle miles traveled: that's what I was just talking about.
Just reducing the average 10,000 miles per household per year, from somewhere in the mid-26,000 per household, has a huge impact not just on air quality and carbon but also on the household pocketbook.
It's very expensive to drive that much, and as we've seen, the middle class is struggling to hold on.
Health care: we were talking about how do you fix it once we broke it -- clean the air.
Why not just stop polluting?
Why not just use our feet and bikes more?
And that's a function of the kinds of cities that we shape.
Household costs: 2008 was a mark in time, not of just the financial industry running amok.
It was that we were trying to sell too many of the wrong kind of housing: large lot, single family, distant, too expensive for the average middle-class family to afford and, quite frankly, not a good fit to their lifestyle anymore.
But in order to move inventory, you can discount the financing and get it sold.
I think that's a lot of what happened.
Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars -- remember, in California the median is 50,000 -- this is a big element.
That's just cars and utility costs.
So the affordable housing advocates, who often sit off in their silos separate from the environmentalists, separate from the politicians, everybody fighting with everyone, now begin to see common cause, and I think the common cause is what really brings about the change.
Los Angeles, as a result of these efforts, has now decided to transform itself into a more transit-oriented environment.
As a matter of fact, since '08, they've voted in 400 billion dollars of bonds for transit and zero dollars for new highways. What a transformation: LA becomes a city of walkers and transit, not a city of cars.
(Applause)
How does it happen? You take the least desirable land, the strip, you add where there's space, transit and then you infill mixed-use development, you satisfy new housing demands and you make the existing neighborhoods all around it more complex, more interesting, more walkable.
Here's another kind of sprawl: China, high-density sprawl, what you think of as an oxymoron, but the same problems, everything isolated in superblocks, and of course this amazing smog that was just spoken to.
Twelve percent of GDP in China now is spent on the health impacts of that.
The history, of course, of Chinese cities is robust.
It's like any other place.
Community was all about small, local shops and local services and walking, interacting with your neighbors.
It may sound utopian, but it's not.
It's actually what people really want.
The new superblocks -- these are blocks that would have 5,000 units in them, and they're gated as well, because nobody knows anybody else.
And of course, there isn't even a sidewalk, no ground floor shops -- a very sterile environment.
I found this one case here in one of the superblocks where people had illicitly set up shops in their garages so that they could have that kind of local service economy.
The desire of people to get it right is there.
We just have to get the planners on board and the politicians.
All right. Some technical planning stuff. Chongqing is a city of 30 million people.
It's almost as big as California.
This is a small growth area.
They wanted us to test the alternative to sprawl in several cities across China.
This is for four-and-a-half million people.
What the takeaway from this image is, every one of those circles is a walking radius around a transit station -- massive investment in metro and BRT, and a distribution that allows everybody to work within walking distance of that.
The red area, this is a blow-up.
All of a sudden, our principles called for green space preserving the important ecological features.
And then those other streets in there are auto-free streets.
So instead of bulldozing, leveling the site and building right up to the river, this green edge was something that really wasn't normative in China until these set of practices began experimentation there.
The urban fabric, small blocks, maybe 500 families per block.
They know each other.
The street perimeter has shops so there's local destinations.
And the streets themselves become smaller, because there are more of them.
Very simple, straightforward urban design.
Now, here you have something I dearly love.
Think of the logic.
If only a third of the people have cars, why do we give 100 percent of our streets to cars?
What if we gave 70 percent of the streets to car-free, to everybody else, so that the transit could move well for them, so that they could walk, so they could bike?
Why not have --
(Applause)
geographic equity in our circulation system?
And quite frankly, cities would function better.
No matter what they do, no matter how many ring roads they build in Beijing, they just can't overcome complete gridlock.
So this is an auto-free street, mixed use along the edge.
It has transit running down the middle.
I'm happy to make that transit autonomous vehicles, but maybe I'll have a chance to talk about that later.
So there are seven principles that have now been adopted by the highest levels in the Chinese government, and they're moving to implement them.
And they're simple, and they are globally, I think, universal principles.
One is to preserve the natural environment, the history and the critical agriculture.
Second is mix. Mixed use is popular, but when I say mixed, I mean mixed incomes, mixed age groups as well as mixed-land use.
Walk. There's no great city that you don't enjoy walking in.
You don't go there.
The places you go on vacation are places you can walk.
Why not make it everywhere?
Bike is the most efficient means of transportation we know.
China has now adopted policies that put six meters of bike lane on every street.
They're serious about getting back to their biking history.
(Applause)
Complicated planner-ese here: connect.
It's a street network that allows many routes instead of singular routes and provides many kinds of streets instead of just one.
Ride. We have to invest more in transit.
There's no silver bullet.
Autonomous vehicles are not going to solve this for us.
As a matter of fact, they're going to generate more traffic, more VMT, than the alternative.
And focus. We have a hierarchy of the city based on transit rather than the old armature of freeways.
It's a big paradigm shift, but those two things have to get reconnected in ways that really shape the structure of the city.
So I'm very hopeful.
In California, the United States, China -- these changes are well accepted.
I'm hopeful for two reasons.
One is, most people get it.
They understand intrinsically what a great city can and should be.
The second is that the kind of analysis we can bring to bear now allows people to connect the dots, allows people to shape political coalitions that didn't exist in the past.
That allows them to bring into being the kinds of communities we all need.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: So, OK: autonomous driving, self-driving cars.
A lot of people here are very excited about them.
What are your concerns or issues about them?
Peter Calthorpe: Well, I think there's almost too much hype here.
First is, everybody says we're going to get rid of a lot of cars.
What they don't say is you're going to get a lot more vehicle miles.
You're going to get a lot more cars moving on streets.
There will be more congestion.
CA: Because they're so appealing -- you can drive while reading or sleeping.
PC: Well, a couple of reasons.
One is, if they're privately owned, people will travel greater distances.
It'll be a new lease on life to sprawl.
If you can work on your way to work, you can live in more remote locations.
It'll revitalize sprawl in a way that I'm deeply frightened.
Taxis: about 50 percent of the surveys say that people won't share them.
If they don't share them, you can end up with a 90 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled.
If you share them, you're still at around a 30 percent increase in VMT.
CA: Sharing them, meaning having multiple people riding at once in some sort of intelligent ride-sharing?
PC: Yeah, so the Uber share without a steering wheel.
The reality is, the efficiency of vehicles -- you can do it with or without a steering wheel, it doesn't matter.
They claim they're the only ones that are going to be efficient electric, but that's not true.
But the real bottom line is that walking, biking and transit are the way cities and communities thrive.
And putting people in their private bubbles, whether they have a steering wheel or not, is the wrong direction.
And quite frankly, the image of an AV on its way to McDonald's to pick up a pack without its owner, just being sent off on these kind of random errands is really frightening to me.
CA: Well, thank you for that, and I have to say, the images you showed of those mixed-use streets were really inspiring, really beautiful.
PC: Thank you. CA: Thank you for your work.
So, raise your hand if you've seen somebody in your city standing on a corner, holding a sign like this.
I think we all have.
If you're being honest, at least one time, have you wondered if they mean it?
If we offered them a job, would they really take it?
And what would that job mean to them in their lives?
Well, this is a story about what happened in my city when we decided to find out, when we decided to think differently about panhandling, and lift people up through the dignity of work.
We call it, "There's a Better Way." We call it There's a Better Way because I believe there's a better way to get the money you need than panhandling on the corner.
I believe there's a better way to help your brothers and sisters in need than handing a few dollars out the car window.
We know there's dignity in work.
We also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that their community is willing to invest in them first.
And because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate, it always feels good to hand a couple of dollars to someone that is in need.
But if you talk to panhandlers, many of them will tell you that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body, they go towards feeding an addiction.
There's a better way.
My name is Richard Berry, and I have one of the best jobs in the world.
I get to be the mayor of a great American city, Albuquerque, New Mexico.
I was at lunch on July 17, 2015, in my great American city, and on my way back to city hall, I saw this gentleman standing on a corner.
As you can see, he's holding a sign, and his sign says he wants a job.
But if you look closer at the picture, you'll see he's standing underneath a blue sign, and that sign says, if you need help, if you need food or shelter or you'd like to donate, please call 311, our community service number.
So why is this guy standing underneath my sign with his sign?
Well, we wondered if anybody would call that 311 sign, and as it turns out, they did -- 11,000 times people called.
I put those up in about 30 intersections.
And we did connect them with food and shelter and services.
But yet he's still standing under my sign with a sign that says he wants a job.
It's simple: he wants a job.
So I decided to do something rare in government.
I decided to make the solution simpler rather than more complicated.
I went back to my office, I gathered my staff around and I said, "We're going to take this man at his word, and others like him.
The man says he wants a job, we're going to give him a job, and we're going to make our city an even better place in the meantime." You see, Albuquerque is a beautiful place.
We're a mile high, the Sandia Mountains on the east, the Rio Grande runs through the center of the city; we're the home of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.
On a day like today, you could literally ski this morning and golf this afternoon.
But there's always something to do -- always weeds to pull, litter to pick up.
If you're going to have an initiative like this in your city, you have to ask yourself two questions.
First one is: Is there anything left to do in your city?
And if the answer is no, would you please give me your mayor's phone number, because I need some advice. (Laughter) But the second question you have to ask is this: Are your solutions to panhandling working?
If you're like Albuquerque, and you're taking the punitive approach like we used to, handing out tickets to panhandlers or those who give them money, I'm going to suggest that your solutions aren't working, and I know you're not getting to the root of your problem in your city.
So if you have something to do and you need people that need something to do, there's a better way.
And the good news is, it's not that complicated.
This a 2006 Dodge van.
It was in my motor pool not doing anything.
We put some new tires on it, wrapped it with a logo.
This van now goes out to street corners where our panhandlers are -- we go to them.
We stop the van, we get out, we ask them if they would like a day's work rather than panhandling for the day.
And if you wondered if they really mean it -- it takes us about an hour to fill this van up in the morning, because almost everybody we ask takes a job for the day.
But you need more than just a van.
You need a super-fantastic human being to drive that van.
And my super-fantastic human being, his name is Will.
This is him in the yellow vest.
Will works at our local nonprofit partner. He works with the homeless every day.
The panhandlers trust him, he believes in them, he hustles.
I like to say, "Where there's a Will, there's a way." So if you're going to do the Better Way campaign in your city, you need to find yourself a Will, because he's really one of the keys to making this successful in the city of Albuquerque.
You also need a great nonprofit partner.
Ours is St. Martin's Hospitality Center.
They've been in our community for over 30 years.
They provide counseling, food, shelter, and if they don't provide it, they know somebody in our city that does.
But they do something much more for me as the mayor. They provide agility. You see, it takes me two weeks, maybe two months sometimes, to onboard an employee with the city of Albuquerque.
So you could imagine -- my old Dodge van, my super-fantastic human being, Will, a great local nonprofit partner -- they drive to the corner, there's a panhandler, they say, "Would you like to work for the day?" The panhandler says, "Yes," a great local nonprofit
I'll be back in six weeks to pick you up. "(Laughter)
It wouldn't work. It's really important that we have that agility in our program.
And they do the paperwork, they do the insurance, they do all of the other forms that I can't do quickly.
We pay our panhandlers nine dollars an hour.
We feed them once at the jobsite.
At the end of the day, our old Dodge van takes them right back to St. Martin's, and they get connected with counseling services.
So far, with the pilot program and a couple days a week, and a fantastic human being and a Dodge van, we've cleaned up 400 city blocks in the city of Albuquerque.
We've picked up over 117,000 pounds of trash, weeds and litter.
I don't know if you've ever weighed a tumbleweed, but they don't weigh much, so you can imagine the volume of material that we've picked up.
My city has 6,000 employees, and none better than my solid waste department.
We send our trucks out at the end of the day, they help the panhandlers put into the truck the material they've picked up during the day, and we take it to the landfill.
I'm lucky that I have city employees that are willing to work side by side with our panhandlers.
They're lifting up our city while lifting up their lives.
And like anything else -- listen, it takes resources.
But the good news is it doesn't take much.
We started with an old van, a super-fantastic human being, a great local nonprofit and $50,000.
But we also had to have community trust.
And fortunately, we had built that up in years prior to Better Way.
We have a program called "Albuquerque Heading Home," a Housing First model where we house the chronically homeless, and when I told my community we wanted to do that differently, I said there's a smart way to do the right thing.
We have now housed 650 chronically homeless, medically vulnerable -- frankly, most likely to die on the streets in our city.
We commissioned our university, they studied it.
We could tell the taxpayers, we can save you 31.6 percent over the cost of leaving someone to struggle for survival on the streets.
We've now saved over five million dollars while housing 650 people.
So we had that community trust, but we had to have a little bit more of an honest conversation also as a community, because we had to get people to understand that when they hand those five dollars out the window, they might actually be minimizing their opportunity to help the person in need, and here's why: that five dollars might go to buying some fast food today -- a lot of times it goes to buying drugs and alcohol.
That same five dollars, if you gave it to one of our shelters, could feed seven people today.
And if you gave it to one of our local food banks or food pantries, we could actually feed 20 people with that money.
People ask, "Well, Albuquerque is 600,000 people — million, metro — this wouldn't work in our city, we're too big, we're too small." I disagree; if you have one panhandler on one city block, you can do this.
you can do this. If you live in a city of eight-and-half million people,
It doesn't matter what you do.
It's not the work that you do, it's the dignity of the work.
You could do anything.
So I think any city could do this.
And people say to me, "Mayor, that's just a little too simple.
It can't work that way." But I tell you what, friends: when you go to a street corner and you engage with a panhandler with dignity and respect, maybe for the first time in years, maybe in their life, and you tell them that you believe in them and that this is their city as much as it's your city, and that you actually need their help to make our place better, and you understand that this isn't the answer to all their problems, but at least it's a start, an amazing thing happens.
When they get out on the jobsite and they start working together, you start seeing amazing things happen.
They see teamwork; they see the fact that they can make a difference.
And at the end of the day, when they get back to St. Martin's in that old Dodge van, they're much more likely to sign up for whatever services they need -- substance abuse, mental health counseling, you name it.
So far with our pilot program, we've offered about 1,700 days of day work.
We've connected 216 people to permanent employment opportunities.
Twenty people actually qualified for our Housing First model, Heading Home, and they've been housed.
And over 150 people have been connected to mental health substance abuse services through There's a Better Way.
This is me just two weeks ago, at St. Martin's, doing our point-in-time survey that we do every two years.
I'm interviewing a gentleman who's homeless, like we do, getting his information, figuring out where he's from, how he got there, what we can do to help him.
And you notice he's holding the same sign that the guy was holding in 2015, same sign I walked out with here today.
So you have to ask yourself: Is it really making a difference?
Absolutely it's making a difference.
Albuquerque is now one of the national leaders in combating some of the most stubborn and persistent social issues that we have.
Combined with Albuquerque Heading Home, the Better Way program, Albuquerque has reduced unsheltered homelessness in our city by 80 percent last year.
Since I took over as mayor, we've been able to reduce the chronic homeless population in our city by 40 percent.
And by HUD's definition, we've gotten to functional zero, which means we've literally ended veteran homelessness in the city of Albuquerque, by being intentional. (Applause) So I'm happy to report that other cities are hearing about this, other mayors are calling us — Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas — and are now starting to implement programs where they bring the dignity of work to the equation.
And I can't wait to learn from them.
I can't wait to see what their experiment looks like, what their pilot project looks like, so we can start taking a collective approach nationally through the dignity of work.
And I want to commend them -- the mayors, their communities, their nonprofits -- for the work that they're doing.
So who's next? Are you and your city ready to step up?
Are you ready to think differently about these persistent social issues?
through the dignity of work. Are you ready to lift people up in your community and make your city profoundly better in many ways?
Well, if you are, my friends, I promise you there is a better way.
(Applause) Thank you.
I'm here to offer you a new way to think about my field, artificial intelligence.
I think the purpose of AI is to empower humans with machine intelligence.
And as machines get smarter, we get smarter.
I call this "humanistic AI" — artificial intelligence designed to meet human needs by collaborating and augmenting people.
Now, today I'm happy to see that the idea of an intelligent assistant is mainstream.
It's the well-accepted metaphor for the interface between humans and AI.
And the one I helped create is called Siri.
You know Siri. Siri is the thing that knows your intent and helps you do it for you, helps you get things done.
But what you might not know is that we designed Siri as humanistic AI, to augment people with a conversational interface that made it possible for them to use mobile computing, regardless of who they were and their abilities.
Now for most of us, the impact of this technology is to make things a little bit easier to use.
But for my friend Daniel, the impact of the AI in these systems is a life changer.
You see, Daniel is a really social guy, and he's blind and quadriplegic, which makes it hard to use those devices that we all take for granted.
The last time I was at his house, his brother said, "Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready.
He's on the phone with a woman he met online." I'm like, "That's cool, how'd he do it?" Well, Daniel uses Siri to manage his own social life -- his email, text and phone -- without depending on his caregivers.
This is kind of interesting, right?
The irony here is great.
Here's the man whose relationship with AI helps him have relationships with genuine human beings.
And this is humanistic AI.
Another example with life-changing consequences is diagnosing cancer.
When a doctor suspects cancer, they take a sample and send it to a pathologist, who looks at it under a microscope.
Now, pathologists look at hundreds of slides and millions of cells every day.
So to support this task, some researchers made an AI classifier.
Now, the classifier says, "Is this cancer or is this not cancer?" looking at the pictures.
The classifier was pretty good, but not as good as the person, who got it right most of the time.
But when they combine the ability of the machine and the human together, accuracy went to 99.5 percent.
Adding that AI to a partnership eliminated 85 percent of the errors that the human pathologist would have made working alone.
That's a lot of cancer that would have otherwise gone untreated.
Now, for the curious, it turns out that the human was better at rejecting false positives, and the machine was better at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.
But the lesson here isn't about which agent is better at this image-classification task.
Those things are changing every day.
The lesson here is that by combining the abilities of the human and machine, it created a partnership that had superhuman performance.
And that is humanistic AI.
Now let's look at another example with turbocharging performance. This is design. Now, let's say you're an engineer.
You want to design a new frame for a drone.
You get out your favorite software tools, CAD tools, and you enter the form and the materials, and then you analyze performance.
That gives you one design.
If you give those same tools to an AI, it can generate thousands of designs.
This video by Autodesk is amazing.
This is real stuff.
So this transforms how we do design.
The human engineer now says what the design should achieve, and the machine says, "Here's the possibilities." Now in her job, the engineer's job is to pick the one that best meets the goals of the design, which she knows as a human better than anyone else, using human judgment and expertise.
In this case, the winning form looks kind of like something nature would have designed, minus a few million years of evolution and all that unnecessary fur.
Now let's see where this idea of humanistic AI might lead us if we follow it into the speculative beyond.
What's a kind of augmentation that we would all like to have?
Well, how about cognitive enhancement?
Instead of asking, "How smart can we make our machines?" let's ask "How smart can our machines make us?" I mean, take memory for example.
Memory is the foundation of human intelligence.
But human memory is famously flawed.
We're great at telling stories, but not getting the details right.
And our memories -- they decay over time.
I mean, like, where did the '60s go, and can I go there, too?
(Laughter)
But what if you could have a memory that was as good as computer memory, and was about your life?
What if you could remember every person you ever met, how to pronounce their name, their family details, their favorite sports, the last conversation you had with them?
If you had this memory all your life, you could have the AI look at all the interactions you had with people over time and help you reflect on the long arc of your relationships.
What if you could have the AI read everything you've ever read and listen to every song you've ever heard?
From the tiniest clue, it could help you retrieve anything you've ever seen or heard before.
Imagine what that would do for the ability to make new connections and form new ideas.
And what about our bodies? What if we could remember the consequences of every food we eat, every pill we take, every all-nighter we pull?
We could do our own science on our own data about what makes us feel good and stay healthy.
And imagine how this could revolutionize the way we manage allergies and chronic disease.
I believe that AI will make personal memory enhancement a reality.
I can't say when or what form factors are involved, but I think it's inevitable, because the very things that make AI successful today -- the availability of comprehensive data and the ability for machines to make sense of that data -- can be applied to the data of our lives.
And those data are here today, available for all of us, because we lead digitally mediated lives, in mobile and online.
In my view, a personal memory is a private memory.
We get to choose what is and is not recalled and retained.
It's absolutely essential that this be kept very secure.
Now for most of us, the impact of augmented personal memory will be a more improved mental gain, maybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace.
But for the millions who suffer from Alzheimer's and dementia, the difference that augmented memory could make is a difference between a life of isolation and a life of dignity and connection.
We are in the middle of a renaissance in artificial intelligence right now. I mean, in just the past few years, we're beginning to see solutions to AI problems that we have struggled with literally for decades: speech understanding, text understanding, image understanding.
We have a choice in how we use this powerful technology. We can choose to use AI to automate and compete with us, or we can use AI to augment and collaborate with us, to overcome our cognitive limitations and to help us do what we want to do, only better.
we get smarter. And as we discover new ways to give machines intelligence, we can distribute that intelligence to all of the AI assistants in the world, and therefore to every person, regardless of circumstance. And that is why, every time a machine gets smarter,
That is an AI worth spreading.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Here's an intriguing fact. In the developed world, everywhere, women live an average of six to eight years longer than men do.
Six to eight years longer.
That's, like, a huge gap.
In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article showing that men in rich countries are twice as likely to die as women are at any age.
But there is one place in the world where men live as long as women.
It's a remote, mountainous zone, a blue zone, where super longevity is common to both sexes.
This is the blue zone in Sardinia, an Italian island in the Mediterranean, between Corsica and Tunisia, where there are six times as many centenarians as on the Italian mainland, less than 200 miles away.
There are 10 times as many centenarians as there are in North America.
It's the only place where men live as long as women.
But why? My curiosity was piqued.
I decided to research the science and the habits of the place, and I started with the genetic profile.
I discovered soon enough that genes account for just 25 percent of their longevity.
The other 75 percent is lifestyle.
So what does it take to live to 100 or beyond? What are they doing right?
What you're looking at is an aerial view of Villagrande.
It's a village at the epicenter of the blue zone where I went to investigate this, and as you can see, architectural beauty is not its main virtue, density is: tightly spaced houses, interwoven alleys and streets.
It means that the villagers' lives constantly intersect.
And as I walked through the village, I could feel hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me from behind doorways and curtains, from behind shutters.
Because like all ancient villages, Villagrande couldn't have survived without this structure, without its walls, without its cathedral, without its village square, because defense and social cohesion defined its design.
Urban priorities changed as we moved towards the industrial revolution because infectious disease became the risk of the day. But what about now? Now, social isolation is the public health risk of our time.
Now, a third of the population says they have two or fewer people to lean on.
But let's go to Villagrande now as a contrast to meet some centenarians.
Meet Giuseppe Murinu. He's 102, a supercentenarian and a lifelong resident of the village of Villagrande.
He was a gregarious man.
He loved to recount stories such as how he lived like a bird from what he could find on the forest floor during not one but two world wars, how he and his wife, who also lived past 100, raised six children in a small, homey kitchen where I interviewed him.
Here he is with his sons Angelo and Domenico, both in their 70s and looking after their father, and who were quite frankly very suspicious of me and my daughter who came along with me on this research trip, because the flip side of social cohesion is a wariness of strangers and outsiders.
But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.
He was a happy-go-lucky guy, very outgoing with a positive outlook.
And I wondered: so is that what it takes to live to be 100 or beyond, thinking positively? Actually, no.
(Laughter)
Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101, the grumpiest person I have ever met.
(Laughter)
And he put a lie to the notion that you have to be positive to live a long life.
And there is evidence for this.
When I asked him why he lived so long, he kind of looked at me under hooded eyelids and he growled, "Nobody has to know my secrets."
(Laughter)
But despite being a sourpuss, the niece who lived with him and looked after him called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure." And she respected him and loved him, and she told me, when I questioned this obvious loss of her freedom, "You just don't understand, do you?
Looking after this man is a pleasure.
It's a huge privilege for me.
This is my heritage." And indeed, wherever I went to interview these centenarians, I found a kitchen party.
Here's Giovanni with his two nieces, Maria above him and beside him his great-niece Sara, who came when I was there to bring fresh fruits and vegetables.
And I quickly discovered by being there that in the blue zone, as people age, and indeed across their lifespans, they're always surrounded by extended family, by friends, by neighbors, the priest, the barkeeper, the grocer.
People are always there or dropping by.
They are never left to live solitary lives.
This is unlike the rest of the developed world, where as George Burns quipped, "Happiness is having a large, loving, caring family in another city."
(Laughter)
Now, so far we've only met men, long-living men, but I met women too, and here you see Zia Teresa. She, at over 100, taught me how to make the local specialty, which is called culurgiones, which are these large pasta pockets like ravioli about this size, this size, and they're filled with high-fat ricotta and mint and drenched in tomato sauce.
And she showed me how to make just the right crimp so they wouldn't open, and she makes them with her daughters every Sunday and distributes them by the dozens to neighbors and friends.
And that's when I discovered a low-fat, gluten-free diet is not what it takes to live to 100 in the blue zone.
(Applause)
Now, these centenarians' stories along with the science that underpins them prompted me to ask myself some questions too, such as, when am I going to die and how can I put that day off?
And as you will see, the answer is not what we expect.
Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher at Brigham Young University and she addressed this very question in a series of studies of tens of thousands of middle aged people much like this audience here.
And she looked at every aspect of their lifestyle: their diet, their exercise, their marital status, how often they went to the doctor, whether they smoked or drank, etc. She recorded all of this and then she and her colleagues sat tight and waited for seven years to see who would still be breathing.
And of the people left standing, what reduced their chances of dying the most? That was her question.
So let's now look at her data in summary, going from the least powerful predictor to the strongest. OK? So clean air, which is great, it doesn't predict how long you will live.
Whether you have your hypertension treated is good.
Still not a strong predictor.
Whether you're lean or overweight, you can stop feeling guilty about this, because it's only in third place.
How much exercise you get is next, still only a moderate predictor.
Whether you've had a cardiac event and you're in rehab and exercising, getting higher now.
Whether you've had a flu vaccine.
Did anybody here know that having a flu vaccine protects you more than doing exercise?
Whether you were drinking and quit, or whether you're a moderate drinker, whether you don't smoke, or if you did, whether you quit, and getting towards the top predictors are two features of your social life.
First, your close relationships.
These are the people that you can call on for a loan if you need money suddenly, who will call the doctor if you're not feeling well or who will take you to the hospital, or who will sit with you if you're having an existential crisis, if you're in despair.
Those people, that little clutch of people are a strong predictor, if you have them, of how long you'll live.
And then something that surprised me, something that's called social integration.
This means how much you interact with people as you move through your day.
How many people do you talk to?
And these mean both your weak and your strong bonds, so not just the people you're really close to, who mean a lot to you, but, like, do you talk to the guy who every day makes you your coffee? Do you talk to the postman?
Do you talk to the woman who walks by your house every day with her dog? Do you play bridge or poker, have a book club?
Those interactions are one of the strongest predictors of how long you'll live.
Now, this leads me to the next question: if we now spend more time online than on any other activity, including sleeping, we're now up to 11 hours a day, one hour more than last year, by the way, does it make a difference?
Why distinguish between interacting in person and interacting via social media?
Is it the same thing as being there if you're in contact constantly with your kids through text, for example?
Well, the short answer to the question is no, it's not the same thing.
Face-to-face contact releases a whole cascade of neurotransmitters, and like a vaccine, they protect you now in the present and well into the future.
So simply making eye contact with somebody, shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five is enough to release oxytocin, which increases your level of trust and it lowers your cortisol levels.
So it lowers your stress.
And dopamine is generated, which gives us a little high and it kills pain.
It's like a naturally produced morphine.
Now, all of this passes under our conscious radar, which is why we conflate online activity with the real thing.
But we do have evidence now, fresh evidence, that there is a difference.
So let's look at some of the neuroscience.
Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland, tried to map the difference between what goes on in our brains when we interact in person versus when we're watching something that's static.
And what she did was she compared the brain function of two groups of people, those interacting live with her or with one of her research associates in a dynamic conversation, and she compared that to the brain activity of people who were watching her talk about the same subject but in a canned video, like on YouTube.
And by the way, if you want to know how she fit two people in an MRI scanner at the same time, talk to me later.
So what's the difference? This is your brain on real social interaction.
What you're seeing is the difference in brain activity between interacting in person and taking in static content.
In orange, you see the brain areas that are associated with attention, social intelligence -- that means anticipating what somebody else is thinking and feeling and planning -- and emotional reward.
And these areas become much more engaged when we're interacting with a live partner.
Now, these richer brain signatures might be why recruiters from Fortune 500 companies evaluating candidates thought that the candidates were smarter when they heard their voices compared to when they just read their pitches in a text, for example, or an email or a letter.
Now, our voices and body language convey a rich signal.
It shows that we're thinking, feeling, sentient human beings who are much more than an algorithm.
Now, this research by Nicholas Epley at the University of Chicago Business School is quite amazing because it tells us a simple thing.
If somebody hears your voice, they think you're smarter.
I mean, that's quite a simple thing.
Now, to return to the beginning, why do women live longer than men?
And one major reason is that women are more likely to prioritize and groom their face-to-face relationships over their lifespans.
Fresh evidence shows that these in-person friendships create a biological force field against disease and decline.
And it's not just true of humans but their primate relations, our primate relations as well.
Anthropologist Joan Silk's work shows that female baboons who have a core of female friends show lower levels of stress via their cortisol levels, they live longer and they have more surviving offspring.
At least three stable relationships.
That was the magic number. Think about it. I hope you guys have three.
The power of such face-to-face contact is really why there are the lowest rates of dementia among people who are socially engaged.
It's why women who have breast cancer are four times more likely to survive their disease than loners are.
Why men who've had a stroke who meet regularly to play poker or to have coffee or to play old-timer's hockey — I'm Canadian, after all —
(Laughter)
are better protected by that social contact than they are by medication.
Why men who've had a stroke who meet regularly -- this is something very powerful they can do.
This face-to-face contact provides stunning benefits, yet now almost a quarter of the population says they have no one to talk to.
We can do something about this.
Like Sardinian villagers, it's a biological imperative to know we belong, and not just the women among us.
Building in-person interaction into our cities, into our workplaces, into our agendas bolsters the immune system, sends feel-good hormones surging through the bloodstream and brain and helps us live longer.
I call this building your village, and building it and sustaining it is a matter of life and death. Thank you.
(Applause)
Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
I have a question for you.
I'm wondering if there's a middle path.
So you talk about the neurotransmitters connecting when in face-to-face, but what about digital technology?
We've seen enormous improvements in digital technology like FaceTime, things like that. Does that work too?
I mean, I see my nephew.
He plays Minecraft and he's yelling at his friends.
It seems like he's connecting pretty well. Is that useful? Is that helpful?
Susan Pinker: Some of the data are just emerging.
The data are so fresh that the digital revolution happened and the health data trailed behind.
So we're just learning, but I would say there are some improvements that we could make in the technology.
For example, the camera on your laptop is at the top of the screen, so for example, when you're looking into the screen, you're not actually making eye contact.
So something as simple as even just looking into the camera can increase those neurotransmitters, or maybe changing the position of the camera.
So it's not identical, but I think we are getting closer with the technology.
HW: Great. Thank you so much.
SP: Thank you.
(Applause)
What's one thing that every person in this room is going to become? Older. And most of us are scared stiff at the prospect.
How does that word make you feel?
I used to feel the same way.
What was I most worried about?
Ending up drooling in some grim institutional hallway.
And then I learned that only four percent of older Americans are living in nursing homes, and the percentage is dropping.
What else was I worried about? Dementia. Turns out that most of us can think just fine to the end.
Dementia rates are dropping, too.
The real epidemic is anxiety over memory loss.
(Laughter)
I also figured that old people were depressed because they were old and they were going to die soon.
(Laughter)
It turns out that the longer people live, the less they fear dying, and that people are happiest at the beginnings and the end of their lives.
It's called the U-curve of happiness, and it's been borne out by dozens of studies around the world.
You don't have to be a Buddhist or a billionaire.
The curve is a function of the way aging itself affects the brain.
So I started feeling a lot better about getting older, and I started obsessing about why so few people know these things.
The reason is ageism: discrimination and stereotyping on the basis of age.
We experience it anytime someone assumes we're too old for something, instead of finding out who we are and what we're capable of, or too young.
Ageism cuts both ways.
All -isms are socially constructed ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia -- and that means we make them up, and they can change over time.
All these prejudices pit us against each other to maintain the status quo, like auto workers in the US competing against auto workers in Mexico instead of organizing for better wages.
(Applause)
We know it's not OK to allocate resources by race or by sex.
Why should it be OK to weigh the needs of the young against the old?
All prejudice relies on "othering" -- seeing a group of people as other than ourselves: other race, other religion, other nationality.
The strange thing about ageism: that other is us.
Ageism feeds on denial -- our reluctance to acknowledge that we are going to become that older person.
It's denial when we try to pass for younger or when we believe in anti-aging products, or when we feel like our bodies are betraying us, simply because they are changing.
Why on earth do we stop celebrating the ability to adapt and grow as we move through life?
Why should aging well mean struggling to look and move like younger versions of ourselves?
It's embarrassing to be called out as older until we quit being embarrassed about it, and it's not healthy to go through life dreading our futures.
The sooner we get off this hamster wheel of age denial, the better off we are.
Stereotypes are always a mistake, of course, but especially when it comes to age, because the longer we live, the more different from one another we become. Right? Think about it. And yet, we tend to think of everyone in a retirement home as the same age: old --
(Laughter)
when they can span four decades.
Can you imagine thinking that way about a group of people between the ages of 20 and 60?
When you get to a party, do you head for people your own age?
Have you ever grumbled about entitled millennials?
Have you ever rejected a haircut or a relationship or an outing because it's not age-appropriate?
For adults, there's no such thing.
All these behaviors are ageist.
We all do them, and we can't challenge bias unless we're aware of it.
Nobody's born ageist, but it starts at early childhood, around the same time attitudes towards race and gender start to form, because negative messages about late life bombard us from the media and popular culture at every turn. Right? Wrinkles are ugly. Old people are pathetic.
It's sad to be old.
Look at Hollywood. A survey of recent Best Picture nominations found that only 12 percent of speaking or named characters were age 60 and up, and many of them were portrayed as impaired.
Older people can be the most ageist of all, because we've had a lifetime to internalize these messages and we've never thought to challenge them.
I had to acknowledge it and stop colluding. "Senior moment" quips, for example: I stopped making them when it dawned on me that when I lost the car keys in high school, I didn't call it a "junior moment."
(Laughter)
I stopped blaming my sore knee on being 64.
My other knee doesn't hurt, and it's just as old.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
We are all worried about some aspect of getting older, whether running out of money, getting sick, ending up alone, and those fears are legitimate and real.
But what never dawns on most of us is that the experience of reaching old age can be better or worse depending on the culture in which it takes place.
It is not having a vagina that makes life harder for women. It's sexism.
(Applause)
It's not loving a man that makes life harder for gay guys. It's homophobia. And it is not the passage of time that makes getting older so much harder than it has to be. It is ageism. When labels are hard to read or there's no handrail or we can't open the damn jar, we blame ourselves, our failure to age successfully, instead of the ageism that makes those natural transitions shameful and the discrimination that makes those barriers acceptable.
You can't make money off satisfaction, but shame and fear create markets, and capitalism always needs new markets.
Who says wrinkles are ugly?
The multi-billion-dollar skin care industry.
Who says perimenopause and low T and mild cognitive impairment are medical conditions?
The trillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry.
(Cheers)
The more clearly we see these forces at work, the easier it is to come up with alternative, more positive and more accurate narratives.
Aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured.
It is a natural, powerful, lifelong process that unites us all.
Changing the culture is a tall order, I know that, but culture is fluid.
Look at how much the position of women has changed in my lifetime or the incredible strides that the gay rights movement has made in just a few decades, right?
(Applause)
Look at gender. We used to think of it as a binary, male or female, and now we understand it's a spectrum.
It is high time to ditch the old-young binary, too.
There is no line in the sand between old and young, after which it's all downhill.
And the longer we wait to challenge that idea, the more damage it does to ourselves and our place in the world, like in the workforce, where age discrimination is rampant.
In Silicon Valley, engineers are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged before key interviews -- and these are skilled white men in their 30s, so imagine the effects further down the food chain.
(Laughter)
The personal and economic consequences are devastating.
Not one stereotype about older workers holds up under scrutiny.
Companies aren't adaptable and creative because their employees are young; they're adaptable and creative despite it. Companies --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
We know that diverse companies aren't just better places to work; they work better.
And just like race and sex, age is a criterion for diversity.
A growing body of fascinating research shows that attitudes towards aging affect how our minds and bodies function at the cellular level.
When we talk to older people like this (Speaks more loudly) or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" -- it's called elderspeak -- they appear to instantly age, walking and talking less competently.
People with more positive feelings towards aging walk faster, they do better on memory tests, they heal quicker, and they live longer.
Even with brains full of plaques and tangles, some people stayed sharp to the end.
What did they have in common?
A sense of purpose.
And what's the biggest obstacle to having a sense of purpose in late life?
A culture that tells us that getting older means shuffling offstage.
That's why the World Health Organization is developing a global anti-ageism initiative to extend not just life span but health span.
Women experience the double whammy of ageism and sexism, so we experience aging differently.
There's a double standard at work here -- shocker --
(Laughter)
the notion that aging enhances men and devalues women.
Women reinforce this double standard when we compete to stay young, another punishing and losing proposition.
Does any woman in this room really believe that she is a lesser version -- less interesting, less fun in bed, less valuable -- than the woman she once was?
This discrimination affects our health, our well-being and our income, and the effects add up over time.
They are further compounded by race and by class, which is why, everywhere in the world, the poorest of the poor are old women of color.
What's the takeaway from that map?
By 2050, one out of five of us, almost two billion people, will be age 60 and up.
Longevity is a fundamental hallmark of human progress.
All these older people represent a vast unprecedented and untapped market.
And yet, capitalism and urbanization have propelled age bias into every corner of the globe, from Switzerland, where elders fare the best, to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom of the Global AgeWatch Index.
Half of the world's countries aren't mentioned on that list because we don't bother to collect data on millions of people because they're no longer young.
Almost two-thirds of people over 60 around the world say they have trouble accessing healthcare.
Almost three-quarters say their income doesn't cover basic services like food, water, electricity, and decent housing.
Is this the world we want our children, who may well live to be a hundred, to inherit?
Everyone -- all ages, all genders, all nationalities -- is old or future-old, and unless we put an end to it, ageism will oppress us all.
And that makes it a perfect target for collective advocacy.
Why add another -ism to the list when so many, racism in particular, call out for action?
Here's the thing: we don't have to choose.
When we make the world a better place to grow old in, we make it a better place in which to be from somewhere else, to have a disability, to be queer, to be non-rich, to be non-white.
And when we show up at all ages for whatever cause matters most to us -- save the whales, save the democracy -- we not only make that effort more effective, we dismantle ageism in the process.
Longevity is here to stay. A movement to end ageism is underway.
I'm in it, and I hope you will join me.
(Applause and cheers)
Thank you. Let's do it! Let's do it!
The philosopher Plato once said, "Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination and life to everything." Music has always been a big part of my life.
To create and to perform music connects you to people countries and lifetimes away.
It connects you to the people you're playing with, to your audience and to yourself.
When I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm bored, when I'm stressed, I listen to and I create music.
When I was younger, I played piano; later, I took up guitar.
And as I started high school, music became a part of my identity.
I was in every band, I was involved with every musical fine arts event. Music surrounded me. It made me who I was, and it gave me a place to belong.
Now, I've always had this thing with rhythms.
I remember being young, I would walk down the hallways of my school and I would tap rhythms to myself on my leg with my hands, or tapping my teeth.
It was a nervous habit, and I was always nervous.
I think I liked the repetition of the rhythm -- it was calming.
Then in high school, I started music theory, and it was the best class I've ever taken.
We were learning about music -- things I didn't know, like theory and history.
It was a class where we basically just listened to a song, talked about what it meant to us and analyzed it, and figured out what made it tick.
Every Wednesday, we did something called "rhythmic dictation," and I was pretty good at it.
Our teacher would give us an amount of measures and a time signature, and then he would speak a rhythm to us and we would have to write it down with the proper rests and notes.
Like this: ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta, ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a. And I loved it. The simplicity of the rhythm -- a basic two- to four- measure line -- and yet each of them almost told a story, like they had so much potential, and all you had to do was add a melody.
(Guitar)
Rhythms set a foundation for melodies and harmonies to play on top of.
It gives structure and stability.
Now, music has these parts -- rhythm, melody and harmony -- just like our lives.
Where music has rhythm, we have routines and habits -- things that help us to remember what to do and to stay on track, and to just keep going.
And you may not notice it, but it's always there.
(Guitar)
And it may seem simple, it may seem dull by itself, but it gives tempo and heartbeat.
And then things in your life add on to it, giving texture -- that's your friends and your family, and anything that creates a harmonic structure in your life and in your song, like harmonies, cadences and anything that makes it polyphonic.
And they create beautiful chords and patterns.
(Guitar)
And then there's you.
You play on top of everything else, on top of the rhythms and the beat because you're the melody.
And things may change and develop, but no matter what we do, we're still the same people.
Throughout a song melodies develop, but it's still the same song.
No matter what you do, the rhythms are still there: the tempo and the heartbeat ... until I left, and I went to college and everything disappeared.
When I first arrived at university, I felt lost.
And don't get me wrong -- sometimes I loved it and it was great, but other times, I felt like I had been left alone to fend for myself.
It's like I had been taken out of my natural environment, and put somewhere new, where the rhythms and the harmonies and the form had gone away, and it was just me --
(Guitar)
silence and my melody. And even that began to waver, because I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't have any chords to structure myself, or a rhythm or a beat to know the tempo.
(Guitar)
And then I began to hear all these other sounds.
(Guitar)
And they were off-time and off-key.
And the more I was around them, the more my melody started to sound like theirs.
And slowly I began to lose myself, like I was being washed away.
But then the next moment --
(Guitar)
I could hear it. And I could feel it. And it was me. And I was here. And it was different, but not worse off.
Just changed a little.
Music is my way of coping with the changes in my life.
There's a beautiful connection between music and life.
It can bind us to reality at the same time it allows us to escape it.
Music is something that lives inside of you.
You create it and you're created by it.
Our lives are not only conducted by music, they're also composed of it.
So this may seem like a bit of a stretch, but hear me out: music is a fundamental part of what we are and of everything around us.
Now, music is my passion, but physics also used to be an interest of mine.
And the more I learned, the more I saw connections between the two -- especially regarding string theory.
I know this is only one of many theories, but it spoke to me.
So, one aspect of string theory, at its simplest form, is this: matter is made up of atoms, which are made up of protons and neutrons and electrons, which are made up of quark.
And here's where the string part comes in.
This quark is supposedly made up of little coiled strings, and it's the vibrations of these strings that make everything what it is.
Michio Kaku once explained this in a lecture called, "The Universe in a Nutshell," where he says, "String theory is the simple idea that the four forces of the universe -- gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the two strong forces -- can be viewed as music.
The music of tiny little rubber bands." In this lecture, he goes on to explain physics as the laws of harmony between these strings; chemistry, as the melodies you can play on these strings; and he states that the universe is a "symphony of strings." These strings dictate the universe; they make up everything we see and everything we know.
They're musical notes, but they make us what we are and they hold us together.
So you see, everything is music.
(Guitar)
When I look at the world, I see music all around us.
When I look at myself, I see music.
And my life has been defined by music.
I found myself through music.
Music is everywhere, and it is in everything.
And it changes and it builds and it diminishes.
But it's always there, supporting us, connecting us to each other and showing us the beauty of the universe.
So if you ever feel lost, stop and listen for your song.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Algorithms are everywhere. They sort and separate the winners from the losers.
The winners get the job or a good credit card offer.
The losers don't even get an interview or they pay more for insurance.
We're being scored with secret formulas that we don't understand that often don't have systems of appeal.
That begs the question: What if the algorithms are wrong?
To build an algorithm you need two things: you need data, what happened in the past, and a definition of success, the thing you're looking for and often hoping for.
You train an algorithm by looking, figuring out. The algorithm figures out what is associated with success. What situation leads to success?
Actually, everyone uses algorithms.
They just don't formalize them in written code.
Let me give you an example. I use an algorithm every day to make a meal for my family.
The data I use is the ingredients in my kitchen, the time I have, the ambition I have, and I curate that data.
I don't count those little packages of ramen noodles as food. (Laughter)
My definition of success is: a meal is successful if my kids eat vegetables.
It's very different from if my youngest son were in charge.
He'd say success is if he gets to eat lots of Nutella.
But I get to choose success.
I am in charge. My opinion matters. That's the first rule of algorithms.
Algorithms are opinions embedded in code.
It's really different from what you think most people think of algorithms.
They think algorithms are objective and true and scientific.
That's a marketing trick.
It's also a marketing trick to intimidate you with algorithms, to make you trust and fear algorithms because you trust and fear mathematics.
A lot can go wrong when we put blind faith in big data.
This is Kiri Soares. She's a high school principal in Brooklyn.
In 2011, she told me her teachers were being scored with a complex, secret algorithm called the "value-added model." I told her, "Well, figure out what the formula is, show it to me.
I'm going to explain it to you." She said, "Well, I tried to get the formula, but my Department of Education contact told me it was math and I wouldn't understand it."
It gets worse. The New York Post filed a Freedom of Information Act request, got all the teachers' names and all their scores and they published them as an act of teacher-shaming.
When I tried to get the formulas, the source code, through the same means, I was told I couldn't. I was denied. I later found out that nobody in New York City had access to that formula.
No one understood it.
Then someone really smart got involved, Gary Rubinstein.
He found 665 teachers from that New York Post data that actually had two scores.
That could happen if they were teaching seventh grade math and eighth grade math.
He decided to plot them.
Each dot represents a teacher.
(Laughter)
What is that?
(Laughter)
That should never have been used for individual assessment.
It's almost a random number generator.
(Applause)
But it was. This is Sarah Wysocki. She got fired, along with 205 other teachers, from the Washington, DC school district, even though she had great recommendations from her principal and the parents of her kids.
I know what a lot of you guys are thinking, especially the data scientists, the AI experts here.
You're thinking, "Well, I would never make an algorithm that inconsistent." But algorithms can go wrong, even have deeply destructive effects with good intentions.
And whereas an airplane that's designed badly crashes to the earth and everyone sees it, an algorithm designed badly can go on for a long time, silently wreaking havoc.
This is Roger Ailes.
(Laughter)
He founded Fox News in 1996.
More than 20 women complained about sexual harassment. They said they weren't allowed to succeed at Fox News.
He was ousted last year, but we've seen recently that the problems have persisted.
That begs the question: What should Fox News do to turn over another leaf?
Well, what if they replaced their hiring process with a machine-learning algorithm?
That sounds good, right? Think about it. The data, what would the data be?
A reasonable choice would be the last 21 years of applications to Fox News. Reasonable. What about the definition of success?
Reasonable choice would be, well, who is successful at Fox News?
I guess someone who, say, stayed there for four years and was promoted at least once. Sounds reasonable. And then the algorithm would be trained.
It would be trained to look for people to learn what led to success, what kind of applications historically led to success by that definition.
Now think about what would happen if we applied that to a current pool of applicants.
It would filter out women because they do not look like people who were successful in the past.
Algorithms don't make things fair if you just blithely, blindly apply algorithms.
They don't make things fair.
They repeat our past practices, our patterns.
They automate the status quo.
That would be great if we had a perfect world, but we don't.
And I'll add that most companies don't have embarrassing lawsuits, but the data scientists in those companies are told to follow the data, to focus on accuracy.
Think about what that means. Because we all have bias, it means they could be codifying sexism or any other kind of bigotry.
Thought experiment, because I like them: an entirely segregated society -- racially segregated, all towns, all neighborhoods and where we send the police only to the minority neighborhoods to look for crime.
The arrest data would be very biased.
What if, on top of that, we found the data scientists and paid the data scientists to predict where the next crime would occur? Minority neighborhood. Or to predict who the next criminal would be? A minority. The data scientists would brag about how great and how accurate their model would be, and they'd be right.
Now, reality isn't that drastic, but we do have severe segregations in many cities and towns, and we have plenty of evidence of biased policing and justice system data.
And we actually do predict hotspots, places where crimes will occur. And we do predict, in fact, the individual criminality, the criminality of individuals.
The news organization ProPublica recently looked into one of those "recidivism risk" algorithms, as they're called, being used in Florida during sentencing by judges.
Bernard, on the left, the black man, was scored a 10 out of 10.
Dylan, on the right, 3 out of 10.
10 out of 10, high risk. 3 out of 10, low risk.
They were both brought in for drug possession.
They both had records, but Dylan had a felony but Bernard didn't.
This matters, because the higher score you are, the more likely you're being given a longer sentence.
What's going on? Data laundering. It's a process by which technologists hide ugly truths inside black box algorithms and call them objective; call them meritocratic.
When they're secret, important and destructive, I've coined a term for these algorithms: "weapons of math destruction."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
They're everywhere, and it's not a mistake.
These are private companies building private algorithms for private ends.
Even the ones I talked about for teachers and the public police, those were built by private companies and sold to the government institutions.
They call it their "secret sauce" -- that's why they can't tell us about it.
It's also private power.
They are profiting for wielding the authority of the inscrutable.
Now you might think, since all this stuff is private and there's competition, maybe the free market will solve this problem. It won't. There's a lot of money to be made in unfairness.
Also, we're not economic rational agents.
We all are biased.
We're all racist and bigoted in ways that we wish we weren't, in ways that we don't even know.
We know this, though, in aggregate, because sociologists have consistently demonstrated this with these experiments they build, where they send a bunch of applications to jobs out, equally qualified but some have white-sounding names and some have black-sounding names, and it's always disappointing, the results -- always.
So we are the ones that are biased, and we are injecting those biases into the algorithms by choosing what data to collect, like I chose not to think about ramen noodles -- I decided it was irrelevant.
But by trusting the data that's actually picking up on past practices and by choosing the definition of success, how can we expect the algorithms to emerge unscathed? We can't. We have to check them.
We have to check them for fairness.
The good news is, we can check them for fairness.
Algorithms can be interrogated, and they will tell us the truth every time.
And we can fix them. We can make them better.
I call this an algorithmic audit, and I'll walk you through it.
First, data integrity check.
For the recidivism risk algorithm I talked about, a data integrity check would mean we'd have to come to terms with the fact that in the US, whites and blacks smoke pot at the same rate but blacks are far more likely to be arrested -- four or five times more likely, depending on the area.
What is that bias looking like in other crime categories, and how do we account for it?
Second, we should think about the definition of success, audit that.
Remember — with the hiring algorithm?
We talked about it. Someone who stays for four years and is promoted once?
Well, that is a successful employee, but it's also an employee that is supported by their culture.
That said, also it can be quite biased.
We need to separate those two things.
We should look to the blind orchestra audition as an example.
That's where the people auditioning are behind a sheet.
What I want to think about there is the people who are listening have decided what's important and they've decided what's not important, and they're not getting distracted by that.
When the blind orchestra auditions started, the number of women in orchestras went up by a factor of five.
Next, we have to consider accuracy.
This is where the value-added model for teachers would fail immediately.
No algorithm is perfect, of course, so we have to consider the errors of every algorithm.
How often are there errors, and for whom does this model fail?
What is the cost of that failure?
And finally, we have to consider the long-term effects of algorithms, the feedback loops that are engendering.
That sounds abstract, but imagine if Facebook engineers had considered that before they decided to show us only things that our friends had posted.
I have two more messages, one for the data scientists out there.
Data scientists: we should not be the arbiters of truth.
We should be translators of ethical discussions that happen in larger society.
(Applause)
And the rest of you, the non-data scientists: this is not a math test.
This is a political fight.
We need to demand accountability for our algorithmic overlords.
(Applause)
The era of blind faith in big data must end.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Laughter) Are you tired of going to work and making money for other people?
And who are those people anyways?
Those people that make money from your work.
Well, they're capitalists.
They have capital, and they use your labor to make more capital.
and making money for other people? So if you're tired of going to work then you're probably like me -- just tired of capitalism.
Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist.
(Laughter)
I own a small business -- Rco Tires in Compton.
A few years ago, when I read Van Jones, and he wrote, "Let's make green collar jobs in the hood," I took him really seriously.
So I cofounded, own and operate a tire recycling company, and I'm really proud of what we've done.
So far, we've recycled a hundred million pounds of rubber.
That's 21 million gallons of oil diverted from landfills into new products.
(Cheers)
We also employ about 15 guys -- mostly people of color, most of whom are felons, and we pay above the minimum wage, and we are now proud members of the United Steelworkers Union.
(Applause)
Now, Rco is not a cooperative now.
It's a privately held company with community-minded ownership, but I would like it to become one.
I would like for them to fire the boss -- that's me.
(Laughter)
And I'm going to tell you why, but first, let me tell you how we got started.
So a lot of people ask, "How did Rco come to be?" And I have to be really honest. I leveraged my white privilege.
So, here's how white privilege worked for me and Rco.
My white grandmother was born on her family's plantation in Arkansas in 1918.
She traveled with her white father west, following the oil boom.
And he held various union oil jobs -- jobs which would have never been given to my black great-grandfather, had he lived here at the time.
Granny became a hairdresser and then got a loan with her husband who built their home in West Los Angeles -- a loan which would never have been given to a black family at the time.
And after my grandfather passed away, my granny was able to keep that house because she had his pension and his health care from a state job which he held, which again, would have never been given to a black man before the anti-discrimination act of the 1960s.
So, you fast-forward 30 years, and I graduate, and I want to start my own business with a pile of debt and a credit card, and no experience in the tire industry.
But I had what most people didn't have. I had a clean, safe, free place to live.
I moved in with my grandmother, and I was able to rent our first warehouse, buy our first truck, pay our first employees, because I didn't have to worry about paying myself, because I didn't need to feed myself, because I am the direct beneficiary of generations of white privilege.
Now, telling the story of white privilege is important because very often people say, "Oh, we want more companies like yours.
We want more Rco's, we want more black-owned businesses, female-led, triple bottom line, Ban the Box, green manufacturing companies," right? But the question we have to ask is, where is the wealth? Where is the money? Where's the capital in our communities to build the types of businesses that we want?
And in telling a story of the white side of my family, I needed a dozen ways where blacks were excluded from the economy, whereas the white side of my family was able to gain access and traction, and build wealth ... Primarily because racism and capitalism are best homies, but --
(Laughter)
but what that means is that when we ask ourselves, "Why are our communities broke?" -- Like, we're not just broke because we're broke; we're broke for a reason.
Historical context really does matter.
But our history tells another story as well.
There's this incredible book called "Collective Courage," which is the story of how thousands of African Americans have been able to build businesses and schools, hospitals, farming cooperatives, banks, financial institutions -- entire communities and sovereign economies, without a lot of capital.
And they did it by working together and leveraging their community assets and trusting each other and putting solidarity first -- not just profits by any means necessary.
And they didn't have to wait around for celebrities and athletes to bring their money back to the hood.
However, if you are a celebrity or an athlete, and you're listening to this, please feel free to bring your money.
(Laughter)
But they did it through cooperative economics, because they knew that capitalism was never going to finance black liberation.
So, there are so many great examples in this book, and I suggest that everybody just read it because it answers the question I asked earlier, which was where are we going to get the wealth to build the types of business that we want.
And the answer is going to have to be cooperative economics.
There's a lot of different versions of cooperativism.
What I'm talking about today is worker ownership.
You may not have heard of worker ownership, but it's been an incredible tool for black economic liberation for a century, and it's also working all over the world right now.
You may have heard of Black Wall Street or maybe the Zapatistas, but I'll give you an example that's a little bit closer to home.
Right now, today, in South Bronx, is the country's largest worker-owned company.
It's called Cooperative Home Care Associates, and it was founded by black and Latinx home care workers who are now able to pay themselves living wages, they have full-time hours, they have benefits and a pension, through their membership as a unit of SEIU.
And these women owners now receive a dividend back on their ownership every year that the company has been profitable, which has been most years.
So they're able to really enjoy the fruits of their labor because they fired the boss.
They don't have any big investors. They don't have fat-cat CEOs or absentee owners taking the profit out of the company.
They each pay in about 1,000 dollars over time in order to gain ownership, and now they own their job.
Now, there's hundreds of more examples of companies like this springing up all across the country.
And I'm so inspired by what they're doing, because it really represents an alternative to the type of economy we have now, which exploits all of us.
It also represents an alternative to waiting around for big investors to bring chain stores, or big-box stores to our communities, because honestly, those types of developments, they steal resources from our communities.
They put our mom-and-pop shops out of business, they make our entrepreneurs into wage workers, and they take money out of our pocket and send it to their shareholders.
So, I was so inspired by all these stories of resistance and resilience that I got together with a few people here in Los Angeles, and we created LUCI.
LUCI stands for the Los Angeles Union Cooperative Initiative, and our objective is to create more worker-owned businesses here in Los Angeles.
So far, in the last year, we've created two: Pacific Electric, an electrical company, and Vermont Gage Carwash, which is right here in South-Central, some of you guys might be familiar with it.
(Applause) This long-time carwash is now owned and operated by its 20 workers, all of whom are union members as well.
So you might be wondering why the focus on union-worker ownership, but there's a lot of good reasons why the labor movement is a natural ally to the worker-ownership movement.
To build these companies that we want in our community, we need a few things.
We're going to need money, people and training.
Unions have all of those things.
America's working class has been paying union dues for decades, and with it, our unions have been building dignified, decent, and democratic workplaces for us.
However, union jobs are on the steep decline, and it's time for us to start calling on our unions to really bring all of their financial and political capital to bear in the creation of new, union, living-wage jobs in our communities.
Also, union halls are full of union members who understand the importance of solidarity and the power of collective action.
These are the types of folks that want more union businesses to exist, so let's build them with them.
Learning from our unions, learning from our past, learning from our peers, are all going to be very important to our success, which is why I'd like to leave you with one last example and a vision for the future ... and that vision is Mondragon, Spain.
Mondragon, Spain is a community built entirely around worker cooperatives.
There's 260-plus businesses here, manufacturing everything from bicycles to washing machines to transformers.
And this group of businesses now employs 80,000 people and earns more than 12 billion euros in revenue every year.
And all of the companies there are owned by the people that work in them.
They've also built universities and hospitals and financial institutions.
I mean, imagine if we could build something like this in South-Central.
The late mayor of Jackson had a similar idea.
He wanted to turn his entire city into a Mondragon-like cooperative economy, calling his ambitious plan "Jackson Rising."
And when I look at Mondragon, I see really what working-class people can do for ourselves when we work together and make decisions for ourselves and each other and our communities.
And what's really incredible about Mondragon is that while we are dreaming about them, they are dreaming about us.
This community in Spain has decided to launch an international initiative to create more communities like it all over the world, by linking up with unions, by supporting organizations like LUCI, and by educating folks about the worker-ownership model.
Now, here's what you can do to be a part of it.
If you're a union member, go to your union meetings, and make sure that your union has a worker-ownership initiative, and become a part of it.
If you're an entrepreneur, if you have a small business, or you're interested in starting one, then link up with LUCI or another organization like us to help you get started on the cooperative model.
If you're a politician, or you work for one, or you just like talking to them, please get the city, state, federal and county legislation passed that we need in order to fund and support worker-owned businesses.
And for everybody else, learn about our history, learn about our models, and seek us out so can support us, you can buy from us, invest in us, lend to us and join us, because it's really going to take all of us in order to build the more just and sustainable and resilient economy that we want for ourselves and our children.
And with that, I would like to leave you with a quote from Arundhati Roy, and she writes ... "Our strategy should not be only to confront Empire, but to lay siege to it.
To deprive it of oxygen. To mock it. To shame it. With our art, our literature, our music, our brilliance, our joy, our sheer relentlessness -- and our ability to tell our own stories.
Not the stories that we're being brainwashed to believe.
The corporate revolution will collapse if we refuse to buy what they're selling -- their ideas, their version of history, their wars, their weapons, their sense of inevitability.
Because know this: They be few and we be many.
They need us more than we need them.
Another world is not only possible, she's on her way.
And on a quiet day, I can hear her breathing."
Thank you.
(Applause)
These are some photos of me volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage in 2006.
When these photos were taken, I thought I was doing a really good thing and that I was really helping those kids.
I had a lot to learn.
It all started for me when I was 19 years old and went backpacking through Southeast Asia.
When I reached Cambodia, I felt uncomfortable being on holiday surrounded by so much poverty and wanted to do something to give back.
So I visited some orphanages and donated some clothes and books and some money to help the kids that I met.
But one of the orphanages I visited was desperately poor.
I had never encountered poverty like that before in my life.
They didn't have funds for enough food, clean water or medical treatment, and the sad little faces on those kids were heartbreaking.
So I was compelled to do something more to help.
I fund-raised in Australia and returned to Cambodia the following year to volunteer at the orphanage for a few months.
I taught English and bought water filters and food and took all of the kids to the dentist for the first time in their lives.
But over the course of the next year, I came to discover that this orphanage that I had been supporting was terribly corrupt.
The director had been embezzling every cent donated to the orphanage, and in my absence, the children were suffering such gross neglect that they were forced to catch mice to feed themselves.
I also found out later that the director had been physically and sexually abusing the kids.
I couldn't bring myself to turn my back on children who I had come to know and care about and return to my life in Australia.
So I worked with a local team and the local authorities to set up a new orphanage and rescue the kids to give them a safe new home.
But this is where my story takes another unexpected turn.
As I adjusted to my new life running an orphanage in Cambodia, (Khmer) I learned to speak Khmer fluently, which means that I learned to speak the Khmer language fluently.
And when I could communicate properly with the kids, I began to uncover some strange things.
Most of the children we had removed from the orphanage were not, in fact, orphans at all.
They had parents, and the few that were orphaned had other living relatives, like grandparents and aunties and uncles and other siblings.
So why were these children living in an orphanage when they weren't orphans?
Since 2005, the number of orphanages in Cambodia has risen by 75 percent, and the number of children living in Cambodian orphanages has nearly doubled, despite the fact that the vast majority of children living in these orphanages are not orphans in the traditional sense.
They're children from poor families.
So if the vast majority of children living in orphanages are not orphans, then the term "orphanage" is really just a euphemistic name for a residential care institution.
These institutions go by other names as well, like "shelters," "safe houses," "children's homes," "children's villages," even "boarding schools."
And this problem is not just confined to Cambodia.
This map shows some of the countries that have seen a dramatic increase in the numbers of residential care institutions and the numbers of children being institutionalized.
In Uganda, for example, the number of children living in institutions has increased by more than 1,600 percent since 1992.
And the problems posed by putting kids into institutions don't just pertain to the corrupt and abusive institutions like the one that I rescued the kids from.
The problems are with all forms of residential care.
Over 60 years of international research has shown us that children who grow up in institutions, even the very best institutions, are at serious risk of developing mental illnesses, attachment disorders, growth and speech delays, and many will struggle with an inability to reintegrate back into society later in life and form healthy relationships as adults.
These kids grow up without any model of family or of what good parenting looks like, so they then can struggle to parent their own children.
So if you institutionalize large numbers of children, it will affect not only this generation, but also the generations to come.
We've learned these lessons before in Australia.
It's what happened to our "Stolen Generations," the indigenous children who were removed from their families with the belief that we could do a better job of raising their children.
Just imagine for a moment what residential care would be like for a child.
Firstly, you have a constant rotation of caregivers, with somebody new coming on to the shift every eight hours.
And then on top of that you have a steady stream of visitors and volunteers coming in, showering you in the love and affection you're craving and then leaving again, evoking all of those feelings of abandonment, and proving again and again that you are not worthy of being loved.
We don't have orphanages in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore, and for a very good reason: one study has shown that young adults raised in institutions are 10 times more likely to fall into sex work than their peers, 40 times more likely to have a criminal record, and 500 times more likely to take their own lives.
There are an estimated eight million children around the world living in institutions like orphanages, despite the fact that around 80 percent of them are not orphans.
Most have families who could be caring for them if they had the right support.
But for me, the most shocking thing of all to realize is what's contributing to this boom in the unnecessary institutionalization of so many children: it's us -- the tourists, the volunteers and the donors.
It's the well-meaning support from people like me back in 2006, who visit these children and volunteer and donate, who are unwittingly fueling an industry that exploits children and tears families apart.
It's really no coincidence that these institutions are largely set up in areas where tourists can most easily be lured in to visit and volunteer in exchange for donations.
Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal, over 90 percent of them are located in the most popular tourist hotspots.
The cold, hard truth is, the more money that floods in in support of these institutions, the more institutions open and the more children are removed from their families to fill their beds.
It's just the laws of supply and demand.
I had to learn all of these lessons the hard way, after I had already set up an orphanage in Cambodia.
I had to eat a big piece of humble pie to admit that I had made a mistake and inadvertently become a part of the problem.
I had been an orphanage tourist, a voluntourist.
I then set up my own orphanage and facilitated orphanage tourism in order to generate funds for my orphanage, before I knew better.
What I came to learn is that no matter how good my orphanage was, it was never going to give those kids what they really needed: their families.
I know that it can feel incredibly depressing to learn that helping vulnerable children and overcoming poverty is not as simple as we've all been led to believe it should be.
But thankfully, there is a solution.
These problems are reversible and preventable, and when we know better, we can do better.
The organization that I run today, the Cambodian Children's Trust, is no longer an orphanage.
In 2012, we changed the model in favor of family-based care.
I now lead an amazing team of Cambodian social workers, nurses and teachers.
Together, we work within communities to untangle a complex web of social issues and help Cambodian families escape poverty.
Our primary focus is on preventing some of the most vulnerable families in our community from being separated in the first place.
But in cases where it's not possible for a child to live with its biological family, we support them in foster care.
Family-based care is always better than placing a child in an institution.
Do you remember that first photo that I showed you before?
See that girl who is just about to catch the ball?
Her name is Torn She's a strong, brave and fiercely intelligent girl.
But in 2006, when I first met her living in that corrupt and abusive orphanage, she had never been to school.
She was suffering terrible neglect, and she yearned desperately for the warmth and love of her mother.
But this is a photo of Torn today with her family.
Her mother now has a secure job, her siblings are doing well in high school and she is just about to finish her nursing degree at university.
For Torn's family -- (Applause)
for Torn's family, the cycle of poverty has been broken.
The family-based care model that we have developed at CCT has been so successful, that it's now being put forward by UNICEF Cambodia and the Cambodian government as a national solution to keep children in families.
(Applause) And one of the best --
And one of the best ways that you can help to solve this problem is by giving these eight million children a voice and become an advocate for family-based care.
If we work together to raise awareness, we can make sure the world knows that we need to put an end to the unnecessary institutionalization of vulnerable children.
How do we achieve that?
By redirecting our support and our donations away from orphanages and residential care institutions towards organizations that are committed to keeping children in families.
I believe we can make this happen in our lifetime, and as a result, we will see developing communities thrive and ensure that vulnerable children everywhere have what all children need and deserve: a family.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Before I get to bulk of what I have to say, I feel compelled just to mention a couple of things about myself.
I am not some mystical, spiritual sort of person.
I'm a science writer.
I studied physics in college.
I used to be a science correspondent for NPR.
OK, that said: in the course of working on a story for NPR, I got some advice from an astronomer that challenged my outlook, and frankly, changed my life.
You see, the story was about an eclipse, a partial solar eclipse that was set to cross the country in May of 1994.
And the astronomer -- I interviewed him, and he explained what was going to happen and how to view it, but he emphasized that, as interesting as a partial solar eclipse is, a much rarer total solar eclipse is completely different.
In a total eclipse, for all of two or three minutes, the moon completely blocks the face of the sun, creating what he described as the most awe-inspiring spectacle in all of nature.
And so the advice he gave me was this: "Before you die," he said, "you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse."
Well honestly, I felt a little uncomfortable hearing that from someone I didn't know very well; it felt sort of intimate.
But it got my attention, and so I did some research.
Now the thing about total eclipses is, if you wait for one to come to you, you're going to be waiting a long time.
Any given point on earth experiences a total eclipse about once every 400 years.
But if you're willing to travel, you don't have to wait that long.
And so I learned that a few years later, in 1998, a total eclipse was going to cross the Caribbean.
Now, a total eclipse is visible only along a narrow path, about a hundred miles wide, and that's where the moon's shadow falls.
It's called the "path of totality." And in February 1998, the path of totality was going to cross Aruba.
So I talked to my husband, and we thought: February? Aruba? Sounded like a good idea anyway.
(Laughter)
So we headed south, to enjoy the sun and to see what would happen when the sun briefly went away.
Well, the day of the eclipse found us and many other people out behind the Hyatt Regency, on the beach, waiting for the show to begin.
And we wore eclipse glasses with cardboard frames and really dark lenses that enabled us to look at the sun safely.
A total eclipse begins as a partial eclipse, as the moon very slowly makes its way in front of the sun.
So first it looked the sun had a little notch in its edge, and then that notch grew larger and larger, turning the sun into a crescent.
And it was all very interesting, but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.
I mean, the day remained bright.
If I hadn't known what was going on overhead, I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.
Well, about 10 minutes before the total solar eclipse was set to begin, weird things started to happen.
A cool wind kicked up.
Daylight looked odd, and shadows became very strange; they looked bizarrely sharp, as if someone had turned up the contrast knob on the TV.
Then I looked offshore, and I noticed running lights on boats, so clearly it was getting dark, although I hadn't realized it.
Well soon, it was obvious it was getting dark.
It felt like my eyesight was failing.
And then all of a sudden, the lights went out.
Well, at that, a cheer erupted from the beach, and I took off my eclipse glasses, because at this point during the total eclipse, it was safe to look at the sun with the naked eye.
And I glanced upward, and I was just dumbstruck. Now, consider that, at this point, I was in my mid-30s.
I had lived on earth long enough to know what the sky looks like. I mean --
(Laughter)
I'd seen blue skies and grey skies and starry skies and angry skies and pink skies at sunrise.
But here was a sky I had never seen.
First, there were the colors.
Up above, it was a deep purple-grey, like twilight.
But on the horizon it was orange, like sunset, 360 degrees.
And up above, in the twilight, bright stars and planets had come out.
So there was Jupiter and there was Mercury and there was Venus.
They were all in a line.
And there, along this line, was this thing, this glorious, bewildering thing.
It looked like a wreath woven from silvery thread, and it just hung out there in space, shimmering.
That was the sun's outer atmosphere, the solar corona.
And pictures just don't do it justice.
It's not just a ring or halo around the sun; it's finely textured, like it's made out of strands of silk.
And although it looked nothing like our sun, of course, I knew that's what it was.
So there was the sun, and there were the planets, and I could see how the planets revolve around the sun.
It's like I had left our solar system and was standing on some alien world, looking back at creation.
And for the first time in my life, I just felt viscerally connected to the universe in all of its immensity.
Time stopped, or it just kind of felt nonexistent, and what I beheld with my eyes -- I didn't just see it, it felt like a vision.
And I stood there in this nirvana for all of 174 seconds -- less than three minutes -- when all of a sudden, it was over.
The sun burst out, the blue sky returned, the stars and the planets and the corona were gone.
The world returned to normal.
But I had changed.
And that's how I became an umbraphile -- an eclipse chaser.
(Laughter)
So, this is how I spend my time and hard-earned money.
Every couple of years, I head off to wherever the moon's shadow will fall to experience another couple minutes of cosmic bliss, and to share the experience with others: with friends in Australia, with an entire city in Germany.
In 1999, in Munich, I joined hundreds of thousands who filled the streets and the rooftops and cheered in unison as the solar corona emerged.
And over time, I've become something else: an eclipse evangelist.
I see it as my job to pay forward the advice that I received all those years ago.
"you owe it to yourself to experience a total solar eclipse." And so let me tell you: before you die,
It is the ultimate experience of awe.
Now, that word, "awesome," has grown so overused that it's lost its original meaning.
True awe, a sense of wonder and insignificance in the face of something enormous and grand, is rare in our lives.
But when you experience it, it's powerful.
Awe dissolves the ego.
It makes us feel connected.
Indeed, it promotes empathy and generosity.
Well, there is nothing truly more awesome than a total solar eclipse.
Unfortunately, few Americans have seen one, because it's been 38 years since one last touched the continental United States and 99 years since one last crossed the breadth of the nation.
But that is about to change.
Over the next 35 years, five total solar eclipses will visit the continental United States, and three of them will be especially grand.
Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 --
(Applause)
the moon's shadow will race from Oregon to South Carolina.
April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow heads north from Texas to Maine. In 2045, on August 12, the path cuts from California to Florida.
I say: What if we made these holidays? What if we --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
What if we all stood together, as many people as possible, in the shadow of the moon?
Just maybe, this shared experience of awe would help heal our divisions, get us to treat each other just a bit more humanely.
Now, admittedly, some folks consider my evangelizing a little out there; my obsession, eccentric.
I mean, why focus so much attention on something so brief?
Why cross the globe -- or state lines, for that matter -- for something that lasts three minutes?
As I said: I am not a spiritual person.
I don't believe in God.
I wish I did.
But when I think of my own mortality -- and I do, a lot -- when I think of everyone I have lost, my mother in particular, what soothes me is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.
I picture myself on that beach, looking at that sky, and I remember how I felt.
My existence may be temporary, but that's OK because, my gosh, look at what I'm a part of.
And so this is a lesson I've learned, and it's one that applies to life in general: duration of experience does not equal impact.
One weekend, one conversation -- hell, one glance -- can change everything.
Cherish those moments of deep connection with other people, with the natural world, and make them a priority.
Yes, I chase eclipses.
You might chase something else.
But it's not about the 174 seconds.
It's about how they change the years that come after.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us.
AI researchers have always said that we humans do not need to worry, because only menial jobs will be taken over by machines. Is that really true? They have also said that AI will create new jobs, so those who lose their jobs will find a new one. Of course. But the real question is: How many of those who may lose their jobs to AI will be able to land a new one, especially when AI is smart enough to learn better than most of us?
Let me ask you a question: How many of you think that AI will pass the entrance examination of a top university by 2020? Oh, so many. OK. So some of you may say, "Of course, yes!" Now singularity is the issue.
And some others may say, "Maybe, because AI already won against a top Go player." And others may say, "No, never. Uh-uh." That means we do not know the answer yet, right?
So that was the reason why I started Todai Robot Project, making an AI which passes the entrance examination of the University of Tokyo, the top university in Japan.
This is our Todai Robot. And, of course, the brain of the robot is working in the remote server.
It is now writing a 600-word essay on maritime trade in the 17th century.
How does that sound?
Why did I take the entrance exam as its benchmark?
Because I thought we had to study the performance of AI in comparison to humans, especially on the skills and expertise which are believed to be acquired only by humans and only through education.
To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo, you have to pass two different types of exams.
The first one is a national standardized test in multiple-choice style.
You have to take seven subjects and achieve a high score — I would say like an 85 percent or more accuracy rate — to be allowed to take the second stage written test prepared by Todai.
So let me first explain how modern AI works, taking the "Jeopardy!" challenge as an example.
Here is a typical "Jeopardy!" question: "Mozart's last symphony shares its name with this planet." Interestingly, a "Jeopardy!" question always asks, always ends with "this" something: "this" planet, "this" country, "this" rock musician, and so on. In other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't ask many different types of questions, but a single type, which we call "factoid questions."
By the way, do you know the answer?
If you do not know the answer and if you want to know the answer, what would you do?
You Google, right? Of course. Why not? But you have to pick appropriate keywords like "Mozart," "last" and "symphony" to search.
The machine basically does the same.
Then this Wikipedia page will be ranked top.
Then the machine reads the page. No, uh-uh.
Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs, including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot, is able to read.
But they are very good at searching and optimizing.
It will recognize that the keywords "Mozart," "last" and "symphony" are appearing heavily around here.
So if it can find a word which is a planet and which is co-occurring with these keywords, that must be the answer.
This is how Watson finds the answer "Jupiter," in this case.
Our Todai Robot works similarly, but a bit smarter in answering history yes-no questions, like, "'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.' Is this sentence true or false?" Our robot starts producing a factoid question, like: "Charlemagne repelled [this person type]" by itself.
Then, "Avars" but not "Magyars" is ranked top.
This sentence is likely to be false.
Our robot does not read, does not understand, but it is statistically correct in many cases.
For the second stage written test, it is required to write a 600-word essay like this one:
[Discuss the rise and fall of the maritime trade in East and Southeast Asia in the 17th century ...]
and as I have shown earlier, our robot took the sentences from the textbooks and Wikipedia, combined them together, and optimized it to produce an essay without understanding a thing.
(Laughter)
But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay than most of the students.
(Laughter)
How about mathematics? A fully automatic math-solving machine has been a dream since the birth of the word "artificial intelligence," but it has stayed at the level of arithmetic for a long, long time.
Last year, we finally succeeded in developing a system which solved pre-university-level problems from end to end, like this one.
This is the original problem written in Japanese, and we had to teach it 2,000 mathematical axioms and 8,000 Japanese words to make it accept the problems written in natural language.
And it is now translating the original problems into machine-readable formulas.
Weird, but it is now ready to solve it, I think. Go and solve it. Yes! It is now executing symbolic computation.
Even more weird, but probably this is the most fun part for the machine.
(Laughter)
Now it outputs a perfect answer, though its proof is impossible to read, even for mathematicians.
Anyway, last year our robot was among the top one percent in the second stage written exam in mathematics.
(Applause)
Thank you.
So, did it enter Todai?
No, not as I expected. Why? Because it doesn't understand any meaning.
Let me show you a typical error it made in the English test.
Two people are talking. For us, who can understand the situation --
[1. "We walked for a long time." 2. "We're almost there." 3. "Your shoes look expensive." 4. "Your shoelace is untied."]
it is obvious number four is the correct answer, right?
But Todai Robot chose number two, even after learning 15 billion English sentences using deep learning technologies.
OK, so now you might understand what I said: modern AIs do not read, do not understand.
They only disguise as if they do.
This is the distribution graph of half a million students who took the same exam as Todai Robot.
Now our Todai Robot is among the top 20 percent, and it was capable to pass more than 60 percent of the universities in Japan -- but not Todai.
But see how it is beyond the volume zone of to-be white-collar workers.
You might think I was delighted.
After all, my robot was surpassing students everywhere.
Instead, I was alarmed.
How on earth could this unintelligent machine outperform students -- our children? Right? I decided to investigate what was going on in the human world.
I took hundreds of sentences from high school textbooks and made easy multiple-choice quizzes, and asked thousands of high school students to answer.
Here is an example:
[Buddhism spread to ... , Christianity to ... and Oceania, and Islam to ...]
Of course, the original problems are written in Japanese, their mother tongue.
[ ______ has spread to Oceania. 1. Hinduism 2. Christianity 3. Islam 4. Buddhism ]
Obviously, Christianity is the answer, isn't it? It's written! And Todai Robot chose the correct answer, too.
But one-third of junior high school students failed to answer this question.
Do you think it is only the case in Japan?
I do not think so, because Japan is always ranked among the top in OECD PISA tests, measuring 15-year-old students' performance in mathematics, science and reading every three years.
We have been believing that everybody can learn and learn well, as long as we provide good learning materials free on the web so that they can access through the internet.
But such wonderful materials may benefit only those who can read well, and the percentage of those who can read well may be much less than we expected.
How we humans will coexist with AI is something we have to think about carefully, based on solid evidence.
At the same time, we have to think in a hurry because time is running out.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you.
Noriko Arai: Thank you.
CA: In your talk, you so beautifully give us a sense of how AIs think, what they can do amazingly and what they can't do.
But -- do I read you right, that you think we really need quite an urgent revolution in education to help kids do the things that humans can do better than AIs?
NA: Yes, yes, yes.
Because we humans can understand the meaning.
That is something which is very, very lacking in AI.
But most of the students just pack the knowledge without understanding the meaning of the knowledge, so that is not knowledge, that is just memorizing, and AI can do the same thing.
So we have to think about a new type of education.
CA: A shift from knowledge, rote knowledge, to meaning.
NA: Mm-hmm.
CA: Well, there's a challenge for the educators. Thank you so much.
NA: Thank you very much. Thank you.
(Applause)
It's Christmas Eve, 1968.
The Apollo 8 spacecraft has successfully completed its first three orbits around the moon.
Launched from Cape Canaveral three days before, this is the first time that humans have ever traveled beyond low Earth orbit.
On the vessel's fourth pass, the Earth slowly comes into view and reveals itself above the Moon's horizon.
Astronaut Bill Anders frantically asks his crewmates where their camera is, grabs the Hasselblad, points it towards the window, presses the shutter, and takes one of the most important photographs of all time: "Earthrise."
When the crew was safely home a few days later, they were asked about the mission.
Anders famously replied, "We went to the moon, but we actually discovered Earth."
What did he and his fellow crewmates feel in this incredible moment?
In a study released just this past year, a team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania examined the testimonies of hundreds of astronauts who had the opportunity to view the Earth from space.
Their analysis uncovered three common feelings: first, a greater appreciation for Earth's beauty; second, an increased sense of connection to all other living beings; and third, an unexpected, often overwhelming sense of emotion.
The researchers believe that seeing the Earth from a great distance provokes someone to develop new cognitive frameworks to understand what they are seeing.
They believe these astronauts were forever changed by this new view, this new perspective, this new visual truth.
This feeling is commonly referred to as the "overview effect."
Only 558 people have ever been to outer space.
558 people had the opportunity to gaze down in awe, to wonder at our planet floating in an infinite sea of darkness.
But what if that number were bigger?
Three years ago, I set off on my own mission: to see if I could bring this feeling of overwhelming scale and beauty to many more people just by using one small computer in my small New York City apartment.
It was then, in 2013, that I launched "Daily Overview." Every day, I have used satellite imagery to create one expansive overhead view of our planet.
More than 1,000 of these images have been created thus far, and more than 600,000 people tune in for this daily dose of perspectives.
I create the imagery by curating photos from the massive archive of a satellite company called Digital Globe.
They operate a constellation of five satellites, each roughly the size of an ambulance, that is constantly taking pictures of the Earth as they orbit at 28,000 kilometers per hour.
Now, what does this mean?
Each of these satellites is equipped with a camera that has a focal length of 16 meters, so that's roughly 290 times greater than a DSLR camera equipped with a standard 55 millimeter lens.
So if were able to attach one of their satellites to the roof of this theater in Oxford, we could take a picture of a football, clearly, on the pitch at the stadium in Amsterdam.
That's 450 kilometers away.
That's incredibly powerful technology.
And I decided at the beginning of this project that I would use that incredible technology to focus on the places where humans have impacted the planet.
As a species, we dig and scrape the Earth for resources, we produce energy, we raise animals and cultivate crops for food, we build cities, we move around, we create waste.
And in the process of doing all of these things, we shape landscapes and seascapes and cityscapes with increasing control and impunity.
So with that in mind, I would like to share a few of my overviews with you now.
Here we see cargo ships and oil tankers waiting outside the entry to the port of Singapore.
This facility is the second-busiest in the world by terms of total tonnage, accounting for one-fifth of the world's shipping containers and one half of the annual supply of crude oil.
If you look closely at this overview, you'll see a lot of little specks.
Those are actually cows at a feedlot in Summerfield, Texas, in the United States.
So once cows reach a particular weight, roughly 300 kilograms, they are moved here and placed on a specialized diet.
Over the next three to four months, the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms before they are shipped off to slaughter.
You're also probably wondering about this glowing pool at the top there.
That gets its color from a unique combination of manure, chemicals and a particular type of algae that grows in the stagnant water.
This is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, a beautiful yet scary scar on the face of the Earth.
Of the world's mined iron ore, 98 percent is used to make steel and is therefore a major component in the construction of buildings, automobiles or appliances such as your dishwasher or refrigerator.
This is a solar concentrator in Seville, Spain.
So this facility contains 2,650 mirrors which are arrayed in concentric circles around an 140-meter-tall tower at its center.
At the top of the tower, there is a capsule of molten salt that gets heated by the beams of light reflected upwards from the mirrors below.
From there, the salt circulates to a storage tank underground, where it produces steam, which spins turbines and generates enough electricity to power 70,000 homes and offsets 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.
This overview shows deforestation in Santa Cruz, Bolivia immediately adjacent to untouched tracts of rainforest.
Deforestation in the country has primarily been driven by the expansion of mechanized agriculture and cattle ranching, so as the country tries to meet the demand of its growing population and feed them, the sacrificial destruction of its rainforest has taken place to do so.
It is estimated that the country lost 4.5 million acres of rainforest in one decade alone from 2000 until 2010.
This is the Eixample district in Barcelona, Spain.
So the overview perspective can be incredibly helpful to help us understand how cities function and how we can devise smarter solutions for urban planning, and this will become only more relevant as it is expected that 4.9 billion people will live in cities around the world by the year 2030.
This area of Barcelona is characterized by its strict grid pattern, apartments with communal courtyards and these octagonal intersections which allow for more sunlight, better ventilation and additional parking at street level.
And here we see that grid pattern but under much different circumstances.
This is the Dadaab Refugee Camp in northern Kenya, the largest such facility of its kind in the world.
To cope with the influx of refugees who are fleeing Somalia, where there is famine and conflict, the UN has built this area gridded out at left called the LFO extension to house more and more refugees who are arriving and occupying these white dots, which are actually tents which will slowly fill up the area over time.
So if you have one of these overviews, you have a moment in time.
If we have two overviews, however, we are able to tell stories about changes in time.
I call that feature of the project "Juxtapose," and we'll share a few examples of it with you now.
So the tulip fields in Netherlands bloom every year in April.
So we take an image captured in March a few weeks before and contrast it to one taken a few weeks later.
We're able to watch the flowers bloom in this magnificent cascade of color.
It is estimated that the Dutch produce 4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year.
In 2015, two dams collapsed at an iron ore mine in southeastern Brazil, causing one of the worst environmental disasters in the history of the country.
It is estimated that 62 million cubic meters of waste were released when the dams broke, destroying numerous villages in the process, including Bento Rodrigues, seen here before ... and after the flood.
Ultimately, 19 people were killed in this disaster.
Half a million people did not have access to clean drinking water for an extended period of time, and the waste soon entered into the Doce River, extended for 650 kilometers all the way into the sea, killing unknowable amounts of plant and animal life along the way.
And lastly, here is a story related to the crisis in Syria, a conflict which has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.
So this patch of desert is seen in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011, the year the conflict started, and when we compare it to an image captured just this year in 2017, we see the construction of the Zaatari refugee camp.
So just as the astronauts of Apollo 8 watched the Earth rising above the lunar landscape for the first time, there is no way that you could have imagined what the places I just showed you look like from outer space.
And while you may enjoy the aesthetics of an image, once you learn exactly what it is you're seeing, you may struggle with the fact that you still like it.
And that's the tension I want to create with my work, because I believe it is that contemplation, that internal dialogue that will lead to greater interest in our planet and more awareness of what we're doing to it.
I believe that viewing the Earth from the overview perspective is more important now than ever before.
Through the incredible technology of these high-flying cameras, we can see, monitor and expose the unprecedented impact that we are having.
And whether we are scientists or engineers or policymakers or investors or artists, if we can adopt a more expansive perspective, embrace the truth of what is going on and contemplate the long-term health of our planet, we will create a better and safer and smarter future for our one and only home.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Why do people deliberately destroy cultural heritage?
By doing so, do they believe they're erasing our history? Our cultural memory? It's true that we are losing cultural heritage to erosion and natural disasters, but this is something that is simply difficult to avoid.
I'm here to show you today how we can use pictures -- your pictures -- to reclaim the history that is being lost using innovative technology and the effort of volunteers.
In the early 20th century, archaeologists discovered hundreds of statues and artifacts at the ancient city of Hatra, in northern Iraq.
Statues like this one were found in fragments, some of them missing their heads or arms, yet the clothing that they are wearing and their pose can still tell us their story.
For example, we believe that by wearing a knee-length tunic and open bare feet, this was representative of a priest.
However, with a closer look at this particular piece, we can see that this tunic being worn was elaborately decorated, which has led many researchers to believe this was actually a statue of a king performing his religious functions.
When the Mosul Cultural Museum opened in 1952 in northern Iraq, this statue, as well as others, were placed there to preserve them for future generations.
Following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, a few statues and artifacts were relocated to Baghdad, but this statue remained.
Then in February of last year, a video was released, and it instantly went viral.
Maybe some of you remember seeing it. Here's a short clip.
(Video) (Singing in Arabic)
(Singing ends)
Not a very pleasant sight, right? Did you notice anything familiar in the video? There it is. There is that very statue, as it was toppled over, breaking into pieces.
When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video, we were shocked.
Since we are archaeologists using innovative technology for digital preservation, an idea sprung to mind.
Maybe we can crowdsource the images that were taken of these artifacts before they were destroyed, to create digital reconstructions.
If we can do that, maybe we can put them into a virtual museum to tell that story.
And so two weeks after we saw this video, we started the project called Project Mosul.
Remember the pictures of the statue I showed you before?
This is actually the crowdsourced reconstruction of it before it was destroyed.
Now, many of you may be wondering, how exactly does this work?
Well, the key to this technology is called photogrammetry, and it was invented here, in Germany.
It is the technology that allows us to use two-dimensional images taken of the same object from different angles to create a 3D model.
I know you may be thinking this sounds like magic -- but it's not. Let me show you how it works.
Here are two crowdsourced images of the same statue.
What the computer can do is it can detect similar features between the photographs -- similar features of the object.
Then, by using multiple photos, in this case, it can begin to reconstruct the object in 3D.
In this case, you have the position of the cameras when each image was taken, shown in blue.
Now, this is a partial reconstruction, I admit, but why would I say partial?
Well, simply because the statue was positioned against a wall.
We don't have photographs taken of it from the back.
If I wanted to complete a full digital reconstruction of this statue, I would need a proper camera, tripods, proper lighting, but we simply can't do that with crowdsourced images.
Think about it: How many of you, when you visit a museum, take photographs of all parts of the statue, even the back side of it?
Well, maybe if some of you find Michelange lo's David interesting, I guess --
(Laughter)
But the thing is, if we can find more images of this object, we can improve the 3D model.
When we started the project, we started it with the Mosul Museum in mind.
We figured we may get a few images, some people interested, make one or two virtual reconstructions, but we had no idea that we had sparked something that would grow so quickly.
Before we knew it, we realized it was obvious: we could apply this same idea to lost heritage anywhere.
And so, we decided to change the name of the project to Rekrei.
Then, in the summer of last year, "The Economist" magazine's media lab reached out to us.
They asked us, "Hey, would you like us to build a virtual museum to put the reconstructions back inside, to tell the story?" Can you imagine us saying no? Of course not. We said yes! We were so excited.
This was exactly the initial dream of that project.
And so now, any of you can experience RecoVR Mosul on your phone, using Google Cardboard or a tablet or even YouTube 360.
Here is a screenshot from the virtual museum.
And there it is ... the partial reconstruction of the statue, as well as the Lion of Mosul, the first reconstruction completed by our project.
Although the video doesn't explicitly show the Lion of Mosul being destroyed, we have many other examples of large artifacts being destroyed that were simply too large to have been stolen.
For example, the Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq.
This is a digital reconstruction from before, and this is actually during the destruction.
Or the Lion of Al-Lāt, in Palmyra, Syria: before... and after.
Although virtual reconstructions are primarily the main focus of our project, some people have been asking the question: Can we print them in 3D?
We believe 3D printing doesn't offer a straightforward solution to lost heritage.
Once an object is destroyed, it's gone.
But 3D printing does offer an addition to tell that story.
For example, I can show you here... There is the statue from Hatra and the Lion of Mosul.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Now, if you look closely, you'll notice that there are some parts that have been printed in color, and some parts that are in white or gray.
This part was added simply to hold the statues up.
This works the same way if you visit a museum, and a statue is found in fragments; it's put together for the people to see it.
This makes sense, right?
However, we're much more interested in what virtual reality has to offer for lost heritage.
Here is an example of one of the tower tombs that was destroyed in Palmyra. Using Sketchfab's online viewer, we can show that we have reconstructed three parts of the exterior of the tomb, but we also have photos of the inside, so we're beginning to create a reconstruction of the wall and the ceiling.
Archaeologists worked there for many, many years, so we also have architectural drawing plans of this lost heritage.
Unfortunately, we are not only losing cultural heritage to areas of conflict and at war -- we're also losing it to natural disasters.
This is a 3D model of Durbar Square in Kathmandu, before the earthquake that occurred last April... and this is after.
You may be thinking, you didn't create these 3D models with only tourist photographs, and that's true.
But what this represents is the ability for large, public organizations and private industry to come together for initiatives like ours.
And so one of the major challenges of our project, really, is to find photographs that were taken before something happens, right?
Well, the internet is basically a database with millions of images, right? Exactly. So we have begun to develop a tool that allows us to extract images from websites like Flickr, based on their geotags, to complete reconstructions.
Because we're not only losing cultural heritage to natural disasters and in war, but we're also losing it to something else. Any idea, just looking at these two pictures?
Maybe it's a little difficult to remember, but only a few weeks ago, this was the example of human destruction by human stupidity.
Because a tourist in Lisbon wanted to climb onto this statue and take a selfie with it --
(Laughter)
and pulled it down with him.
So we're already finding photographs to complete a digital reconstruction of this.
We need to remember that the destruction of cultural heritage isn't a recent phenomenon.
In the 16th century, European priests and explorers burned thousands of Maya books in the Americas, of which we only have a handful left.
Fast-forward to 2001, when the Taliban blew up the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.
You see, cultural heritage is about our shared global history.
It helps us connect with our ancestors and their stories, but we're losing pieces of it every day to natural disasters and in areas of conflict.
Of course, the loss of human life is the most heartbreaking loss ... but cultural heritage offers us a way to preserve the memory of the people for future generations.
We need your help to reclaim the history that is being lost.
(Applause) Will you join us?
Do you remember these glow-in-the-dark little stars which you had on the ceiling when you were a boy or a girl? Yes? It is light. It is pure light.
I think I stared at them way too long when I was a five-year-old, you know?
It's so beautiful: no energy bill, no maintenance. It is there.
So two years ago, we went back to the lab, making it more durable, more light-emitting, with the experts.
And at the same time, we got a request from this guy — Van Gogh, the famous Van Gogh Foundation — who wanted to celebrate his 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.
And they came to me and asked, "Can you make a place where he feels more alive again in the Netherlands?" And I liked that question a lot, so in way, we sort of started to connect these two different worlds.
This is how my brain works, by the way.
(Laughter) I would love to keep on doing this for an hour, but OK — (Laughter)
And this is the result that we made: a bicycle path which charges at daytime via the sun and glows at night, up to eight hours. (Applause)
Thank you.
... hinting towards a future which should be energy friendly and linking up the local grounds as Van Gogh literally walked and lived there in 1883.
And you can go there every night for free, no ticket needed.
People experience the beauty of cycling through the starry night, thinking about green energy and safety.
I want to create places where people feel connected again.
And it was somehow great to make these projects happen with the industry, with the infrastructure companies.
So when these sheikhs of Qatar started to call: "How much for 10 kilometers?"
(Laughter)
Yeah, really, that's a weird call you're going to get.
But it's fascinating that this is not just a sort of one-off, nice-to-have special.
I think this kind of creative thinking, these kinds of connections -- it's the new economy.
The World Economic Forum, the think tank in Geneva, did an interview with a lot of smart people all around the world, asking, "What are the top 10 skills you and I need to become successful?" And what is interesting, what you see here: it's not about money or being really good in C++, although these are great skills to have, I have to admit.
But look at number three, creativity; number two, critical thinking; number one, complex problem-solving -- all the things a robot or a computer is really bad at.
And this makes me very optimistic, very hopeful for the new world, that as we will live in this hyper-technological world, our human skills -- our desire for empathy, our desire for curiosity, our desire for beauty -- will be more appreciated again, and we will live in a world where creativity is our true capital.
And a creative process like that -- I don't know how it works for you, but in my brain, it always starts with a question: Why?
Why does a jellyfish emit light? Or a firefly? Or why do be accept pollution?
This is from my room in Beijing three years ago.
Left image is a good day -- Saturday.
I can see the cars and the people, the birds; life is OK in a dense urban city.
And on the right image — holy moly.
Pollution -- complete layers.
I couldn't even see the other side of the city.
And this image made me really sad.
This is not the bright future we envision here at TED -- this is the horror.
We live five to six years shorter; children have lung cancer when they're six years old.
And so in a weird, beautiful way, I, at that moment, became inspired by Beijing smog.
And the governments all around the world are fighting their war on smog, but I wanted to make something within the now.
So we decided to build the largest smog vacuum cleaner in the world.
It sucks up polluted air, cleans it and then releases it.
And we built the first one.
So it sucks up 30,000 cubic meters per hour, cleans it on the nano level -- the PM2.5, PM10 particles -- using very little electricity, and then releases the clean air, so we have parks, playgrounds, which are 55 to 75 percent more clean than the rest of the city.
(Applause)
(Applause) Yes!
And every month or so, it opens like a spaceship -- like a Marilyn Monroe with the -- well, you know what. Anyway.
(Laughter)
So this ... this is the stuff we are capturing.
This is Beijing smog. This is in our lungs right now.
If you live next to a highway, it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day. Are we insane? When did we say yes to that?
And we had buckets of this disgusting material in our studio, and on a Monday morning, we were discussing, we were like, "Shit, what should we do with it?
Should we throw it away? "Like," Help! "And then we realized: no, no, no, no, no — waste should not exist.
Waste for the one should be food for the other. So, here, maybe show it around.
Do not put this in your coffee.
(Laughter)
And we realized that 42 percent is made out of carbon, and carbon, of course, under high pressure, you get... diamonds.
So, inspired by that, we compress it for 30 minutes -- (Cracking sound)
(Laughter)
And so by sharing — yeah, really!
(Applause) And so by sharing a ring, you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air to the city the tower is in.
I have one here --
(Applause)
A little floating cube. I will give one to you.
I'm not going to propose, don't worry.
(Laughter)
Are we good? You can show it around.
And we put this online — Kickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.
And people started to preorder it, but more importantly, they started to prepay it.
So the finance we made with the jewelry helped us to realize, to build the first tower.
And that's powerful. So the waste the activator, it was the enabler.
Also, the feedback from the community -- this is a wedding couple from India, where he proposed to her with the smog-free ring as a sign of true beauty, as a sign of hope.
And she said yes.
(Laughter)
I love this image so much for a lot of different reasons.
(Laughter)
And right now, the project is touring through China, actually with the support of China's central government.
So the first goal is to create local clean-air parks, and that works already quite well -- 55, 75 percent more clean.
And at the same time, we team up with the NGOs, with the governors, with the students, with the tech people, to say, "Hey, what do we need to do to make a whole city smog-free?" It's about the dream of clean air. We do workshops. New ideas pop up.
These are smog-free bicycles which -- I'm Dutch, yes? -- I have this "bicycle DNA" inside of me somewhere.
And so it sucks up polluted air, it cleans it and releases it, in the fight against the car, in the celebration of the bicycle.
Yes? And so right now, we're working on a sort of "package deal," so to speak, where we say, "Smog-free towers, smog-free rings." We go to the mayors or the governors of this world, and say, "We can guarantee a short-term reduction of pollution between 20 and 40 percent. Please sign here right now."
(Applause)
(Applause) Thank you.
So it's all about connecting new technology with creative thinking.
And if you start thinking about that, there is so much you can imagine, so much more you can do.
We worked on dance floors which produce electricity when you dance on them.
We did the design for that -- 2008.
So it moves eight or nine millimeters, produces 25 watts.
The electricity that we generate is used for the lighting or the DJ booth.
So some of the sustainability is about doing more, not about doing less.
But also on a larger scale, the Netherlands, where I'm from, we live below sea level.
So because of these beauties -- the Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers, built by hand in 1932 -- we live with the water, we fight with the water, we try to find harmony, but sometimes we forget.
And therefore, we made "Waterlicht," a combination of LEDs and lenses, which show how high the water level would be -- global change -- if we stop.
If, today, we all go home and we say, "Oh, whatever, somebody else will do it for us," or we'll wait for government or whomever.
You know, we're not going to do that. It goes wrong. And we placed this in public spaces all around the world.
Thousands of people showed up.
(Applause)
Thank you. You're too nice, you're too nice. That's not good for a designer.
So thousands of people showed up, and some, actually, were scared. And they left; they experienced the floods in 1953.
And others were mesmerized.
Can we make floating cities?
Can we generate electricity from the change in tides?
So I think it's so important to make experiences -- collective experiences -- where people feel connected with a vision, with a future and trigger what is possible.
At the same time, you know, these kinds of things -- they're not easy, yes?
It's a struggle.
And what I experienced in my life is that a lot of people say they want innovation, and they want the next and the new, the future. But the moment you present a new idea, there's this weird tendency to reply to every new idea starting with two words. Which are?
(Laughter) (Audience guesses) No, not "How much?" It's more annoying.
What is it, guys?
Or you're really blessed people?
That's really good. "Yes, but." Very good. "Yes, but: it's too expensive, it's too cheap, it's too fast, it's too slow, it's too beautiful, it's too ugly, it cannot be done, it already exists." I heard everything about the same project in the same week. And I got really, really annoyed.
I got a bit of gray hair, started to dress in black like a true architect.
(Laughter)
And one morning I woke up and I said, "Daan, stop. This is dragging you down. You have to do something with this.
You have to use it as an ingredient, as a component." And so we decided to build, to realize the famous "Yes, but" chair.
(Laughter)
And this is an existing chair by Friso Kramer, a Dutch design. But we gave it a little "update," a little "hack," so to speak.
We placed a little voice-recognition element right here.
So the moment you sit on that chair, and you say those two horrible, creative-destructive, annoying little words --
(Laughter)
you get a short — (Laughter)
but pretty intense little shock on the back side of your bottom.
(Laughter) (Applause)
(Applause) and that works; yeah, that works.
Some clients have left us, they got really mad.
Fortunately, the good ones have stayed.
And, of course, we also apply it to ourselves.
But ladies and gentlemen, let's not be afraid. Let's be curious, yes? And, you know, walking through TED in these days and hearing the other speakers and feeling the energy of the crowd, I was remembering this quote of the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan, who once famously said, "On spacecraft earth, there are no passengers.
We are all crew. "And I think this so beautiful.
This is so beautiful!
We're not just consumers; we're makers: we make decisions, we make new inventions, we make new dreams.
And I think if we start implementing that kind of thinking even more within today, there's still a whole new world to be explored.
All right, thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
So in 2011, I altered my name so that I could participate in Far Right youth camp in Hungary.
I was doing a PhD looking at youth political socialization -- why young people were developing political ideologies in a post-communist setting, and I saw that a lot of young people I was talking to were joining the Far Right, and this was astounding to me.
So I wanted to enroll in this youth camp to get a better understanding of why people were joining.
So a colleague enrolled me, and my last name sounds a little bit too Jewish.
So Erin got turned into Iréna, and Saltman got turned into Sós, which means "salty" in Hungarian.
And in Hungarian, your last name goes first, so my James Bond name turned into "Salty Irena," which is not something I would have naturally chosen for myself.
But going to this camp, I was further shocked to realize that it was actually really fun.
They talked very little about politics.
It was mostly learning how to ride horses, shooting a bow and arrow, live music at night, free food and alcohol, also some air-gun target practice using mainstream politicians' faces as targets.
And this seemed like a very, actually, friendly, inclusive group until you started talking or mentioning anything to do with the Roma population, Jewish people or immigrants, and then the discourse would become very hate-based very quickly.
So it led me into my work now, where we pose the question, "Why do people join violent extremist movements, and how do we effectively counter these processes?" In the aftermath of horrible atrocities and attacks in places like Belgium, France, but all over the world, sometimes it's easier for us to think, "Well, these must be sociopaths, these must be naturally violent individuals.
They must have something wrong with their upbringing." And what's really tragic is that oftentimes there's no one profile.
Many people come from educated backgrounds, different socioeconomic backgrounds, men and women, different ages, some with families, some single. So why? What is this allure?
And this is what I want to talk you through, as well as how do we challenge this in a modern era?
We do know, through research, that there are quite a number of different things that affect somebody's process of radicalization, and we categorize these into push and pull factors.
And these are pretty much similar for Far Right, neo-Nazi groups all the way to Islamist extremist and terrorist groups.
And push factors are basically what makes you vulnerable to a process of radicalization, to joining a violent extremist group.
And these can be a lot of different things, but roughly, a sense of alienation, a sense of isolation, questioning your own identity, but also feeling that your in-group is under attack, and your in group might be based on a nationality or an ethnicity or a religion, and feeling that larger powers around you are doing nothing to help.
Now, push factors alone do not make you a violent extremist, because if that were the fact, those same factors would go towards a group like the Roma population, and they're not a violently mobilized group.
So we have to look at the pull factors.
What are these violent extremist organizations offering that other groups are not offering?
And actually, this is usually very positive things, very seemingly empowering things, such as brotherhood and sisterhood and a sense of belonging, as well as giving somebody a spiritual purpose, a divine purpose to build a utopian society if their goals can be met, but also a sense of empowerment and adventure.
When we look at foreign terrorist fighters, we see young men with the wind in their hair out in the desert and women going to join them to have nuptials out in the sunset.
It's very romantic, and you become a hero.
For both men and women, that's the propaganda being given.
So what extremist groups are very good at is taking a very complicated, confusing, nuanced world and simplifying that world into black and white, good and evil.
And you become what is good, challenging what is evil.
So I want to talk a little bit about ISIS, Daesh, because they have been a game changer in how we look at these processes, and through a lot of the material and their tactics.
They're very much a modern movement.
One of the aspects is the internet and the usage of social media, as we've all seen in headlines tweeting and videos of beheadings.
But the internet alone does not radicalize you.
The internet is a tool.
You don't go online shopping for shoes and accidentally become a jihadist.
However, what the Internet does do is it is a catalyst.
It provides tools and scale and rapidity that doesn't exist elsewhere.
And with ISIS, all of a sudden, this idea of a cloaked, dark figure of a jihadist changed for us.
All of a sudden, we were in their kitchens.
We saw what they were eating for dinner. They were tweeting. We had foreign terrorist fighters tweeting in their own languages.
We had women going out there talking about their wedding day, about the births of their children.
We had gaming culture, all of a sudden, and references to Grand Theft Auto being made.
So all of a sudden, they were homey. They became human. And the problem is that trying to counter it, lots of governments and social media companies just tried to censor.
How do we get rid of terrorist content?
And it became a cat-and-mouse game where we would see accounts taken down and they'd just come back up, and an arrogance around somebody having a 25th account and material that was disseminated everywhere.
But we also saw a dangerous trend -- violent extremists know the rules and regulations of social media, too.
So we would see a banal conversation with a recruiter start on a mainstream platform, and at the point at which that conversation was going to become illegal, they would jump to a smaller, less regulated, more encrypted platform.
So all of a sudden, we couldn't track where that conversation went.
So this is a problem with censorship, which is why we need to develop alternatives to censorship.
ISIS is also a game-changer because it's state-building.
It's not just recruiting combatants; it's trying to build a state.
And what that means is all of a sudden, your recruitment model is much more broad.
You're not just trying to get fighters -- now you need architects, engineers, accountants, hackers and women.
We've actually seen a huge increase of women going in the last 24, but especially 12 months.
Some countries, one in four of the people going over to join are now women.
And so, this really changes who we're trying to counter this process with.
Now, not all doom and gloom.
So the rest I'd like to talk about some of the positive things and the new innovation in trying to prevent and counter violent extremism.
Preventing is very different than countering, and actually, you can think of it in medical terms.
So preventative medicine is, how do we make it so you are naturally resilient to this process of radicalization, whereas that is going to be different if somebody is already showing a symptom or a sign of belonging to a violent extremist ideology.
And so in preventative measures, we're talking more about really broad groups of people and exposure to ideas to make them resilient.
Whereas it's very different if somebody is starting to question and agree with certain things online, and it's also very different if somebody already has a swastika tattoo and is very much embedded within a group.
How do you reach them?
So I'd like to go through three examples of each one of those levels and talk you through what some of the new ways of engaging with people are becoming.
One is "Extreme Dialogue," and it's an educational program that we helped develop.
This one is from Canada, and it's meant to create dialogues within a classroom setting, using storytelling, because violent extremism can be very hard to try to explain, especially to younger individuals.
So we have a network of former extremists and survivors of extremism that tell their stories through video and create question-giving to classrooms, to start a conversation about the topic.
These two examples show Christianne, who lost her son, who radicalized and died fighting for ISIS, and Daniel is a former neo-Nazi who was an extremely violent neo-Nazi, and they pose questions about their lives and where they're at and regret, and force a classroom to have a dialogue around it.
Now, looking at that middle range of individuals, actually, we need a lot of civil society voices.
How do you interact with people that are looking for information online, that are starting to toy with an ideology, that are doing those searching identity questions?
How do we provide alternatives for that?
And that's when we combine large groups of civil society voices with creatives, techies, app developers, artists, comedians, and we can create really specified content and actually, online, disseminate it to very strategic audiences.
So one example would be creating a satirical video which makes fun of Islamophobia, and targeting it to 15- to 20-year-olds online that have an interest in white power music and live specifically in Manchester.
We can use these marketing tools to be very specific, so that we know when somebody's viewing, watching and engaging with that content, it's not just the average person, it's not me or you -- it's a very specific audience that we are looking to engage with.
Even more downstream, we developed a pilot program called "One to One," where we took former extremists and we had them reach out directly to a group of labeled neofascists as well as Islamist extremists, and put direct messages through Facebook Messenger into their inbox, saying, "Hey, I see where you're going.
I've been there.
If you want to talk, I'm here." Now, we kind of expected death threats from this sort of interaction.
It's a little alarming to have a former neo-Nazi say, "Hey, how are you?" But actually, we found that around 60 percent of the people reached out to responded, and of that, around another 60 percent had sustained engagement, meaning that they were having conversations with the hardest people to reach about what they were going through, planting seeds of doubt and giving them alternatives for talking about these subjects, and that's really important.
So what we're trying to do is actually bring unlikely sectors to the table.
We have amazing activists all over the world, but oftentimes, their messages are not strategic or they don't actually reach the audiences they want to reach.
So we work with networks of former extremists. We work with networks of young people in different parts of the world.
And we work with them to bring the tech sector to the table with artists and creatives and marketing expertise so that we can actually have a more robust and challenging of extremism that works together.
So I would say that if you are in the audience and you happen to be a graphic designer, a poet, a marketing expert, somebody that works in PR, a comedian -- you might not think that this is your sector, but actually, the skills that you have right now might be exactly what is needed to help challenge extremism effectively.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, my mother's a pediatrician, and when I was young, she'd tell the craziest stories that combined science with her overactive imagination.
One of the stories she told was that if you eat a lot of salt, all of the blood rushes up your legs, through your body, and shoots out the top of your head, killing you instantly.
(Laughter)
She called it "high blood pressure."
(Laughter)
This was my first experience with science fiction, and I loved it.
So when I started to write my own science fiction and fantasy, I was surprised that it was considered un-African.
So naturally, I asked, what is African?
And this is what I know so far: Africa is important.
Africa is the future. It is, though. And Africa is a serious place where only serious things happen.
So when I present my work somewhere, someone will always ask, "What's so important about it?
How does it deal with real African issues like war, poverty, devastation or AIDS?" And it doesn't.
My work is about Nairobi pop bands that want to go to space or about seven-foot-tall robots that fall in love.
It's nothing incredibly important.
It's just fun, fierce and frivolous, as frivolous as bubble gum -- "AfroBubbleGum."
So I'm not saying that agenda art isn't important; I'm the chairperson of a charity that deals with films and theaters that write about HIV and radicalization and female genital mutilation.
It's vital and important art, but it cannot be the only art that comes out of the continent.
We have to tell more stories that are vibrant.
The danger of the single story is still being realized.
And maybe it's because of the funding.
A lot of art is still dependent on developmental aid.
So art becomes a tool for agenda.
Or maybe it's because we've only seen one image of ourselves for so long that that's all we know how to create.
Whatever the reason, we need a new way, and AfroBubbleGum is one approach.
It's the advocacy of art for art's sake.
It's the advocacy of art that is not policy-driven or agenda-driven or based on education, just for the sake of imagination: AfroBubbleGum art.
And we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists.
We have to judge our work for its potential poverty porn pitfalls.
We have to have tests that are similar to the Bechdel test, and ask questions like: Are two or more Africans in this piece of fiction healthy?
Are those same Africans financially stable and not in need of saving?
Are they having fun and enjoying life?
And if we can answer yes to two or more of these questions, then surely we're AfroBubbleGumists.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And fun is political, because imagine if we have images of Africans who were vibrant and loving and thriving and living a beautiful, vibrant life.
What would we think of ourselves then?
Would we think that maybe we're worthy of more happiness?
Would we think of our shared humanity through our shared joy?
I think of these things when I create.
I think of the people and the places that give me immeasurable joy, and I work to represent them.
And that's why I write stories about futuristic girls that risk everything to save plants or to race camels or even just to dance, to honor fun, because my world is mostly happy.
And I know happiness is a privilege in this current splintered world where remaining hopeful requires diligence.
But maybe, if you join me in creating, curating and commissioning more AfroBubbleGum art, there might be hope for a different view of the world, a happy Africa view where children are strangely traumatized by their mother's dark sense of humor,
(Laughter)
but also they're claiming fun, fierce and frivolous art in the name of all things unseriously African.
Because we're AfroBubbleGumists and there's so many more of us than you can imagine.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
Someday, we may have robots as smart as people, artificial intelligence, AI.
How could that happen?
One route is that we'll just keep accumulating better software, like we've been doing for 70 years.
At past rates of progress, that may take centuries.
Some say it'll happen a lot faster as we discover grand new powerful theories of intelligence. I'm skeptical.
But a third scenario is what I'm going to talk about today.
The idea is to port the software from the human brain.
To do this, we're going to need three technologies to be good enough, and none of them are there yet.
First, we're going to need lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.
Second, we're going to need to scan individual human brains in fine spatial and chemical detail, to see exactly what cells are where, connected to what, of what type.
And third, we're going to need computer models of how each kind of brain cell works -- taking input signals, changing interval state and sending output signals.
If we have good enough models of all the kinds of brain cells and a good enough model of the brain, we can put it together to make a good enough model of an entire brain, and that model would have the same input-output behavior as the original.
So if you talk to it, it might talk back.
If you ask it to do things, it might do them.
And if we could do that, everything would change.
People have been talking about this idea for decades, under the name of "uploads." I'm going to call them "ems." When they talk about it, they say, "Is this even possible?
If you made one, would it be conscious?
Or is it just an empty machine?
If you made one of me, is that me or someone else?" These are all fascinating questions that I'm going to ignore ...
(Laughter)
because I see a neglected question: What would actually happen?
I became obsessed with this question.
I spent four years trying to analyze it, using standard academic tools, to guess what would happen, and I'm here to tell you what I found.
But be warned -- I'm not offering inspiration, I'm offering analysis.
I see my job as telling you what's most likely to happen if we did the least to avoid it.
If you aren't at least a bit disturbed by something I tell you here, you're just not paying attention.
(Laughter)
OK, the first thing I can tell you is that ems spend most of their life in virtual reality.
This is what you might look like if you were using virtual reality. And this is what you might see: sunlight glinting off of water, you might hear gulls flying above, you might even feel the wind on your cheeks or smell seawater, with advanced hardware.
Now, if you were to spend a lot of time here, you might want a dashboard where you could do things like make a phone call, move to a new virtual world, check your bank account.
Now, while this is what you would look like in virtual reality, this is what an em would look like in virtual reality.
It's computer hardware sitting in a server rack somewhere.
But still, it could see and experience the same thing.
But some things are different for ems.
First, while you'll probably always notice that virtual reality isn't entirely real, to an em, it can feel as real to them as this room feels to you now or as anything ever feels.
And ems also have some more action possibilities.
For example, your mind just always runs at the same speed, but an em can add more or less computer hardware to run faster or slower, and therefore, if the world around them seems to be going too fast, they can just speed up their mind, and the world around them would seem to slow down.
In addition, an em can make a copy of itself at that moment.
This copy would remember everything the same, and if it starts out with the same speed, looking at the same speed, it might even need to be told, "You are the copy." And em could make archive copies, and with enough archives, an em can be immortal -- in principle, though not usually in practice.
And an em can move its brain, the computer that represents its brain, from one physical location to another.
Ems can actually move around the world at the speed of light, and by moving to a new location, they can interact more quickly with ems near that new location.
So far, I've been talking about what ems can do.
What do ems choose to do?
To understand that, we'll need to understand three key facts.
First, ems by definition do what the human they emulate would do in the same situation.
So their lives and behavior are very human.
They're mainly different because they're living in a different world.
Second, ems need real resources to survive.
You need food and shelter or you'll die.
Also, ems need computer hardware, energy, cooling, or they can't exist.
For every subjective minute that an em experiences, someone, usually that em, had to work to pay for it.
Third, ems are poor.
(Laughter)
The em population can grow quicker than the em economy, so that means wages fall down to em subsistence levels.
That means ems have to be working most of the time.
So that means this is what ems usually see: beautiful and luxurious, but desks -- they're working most of the time.
Now, a subsistence wage scenario, you might think, is exotic and strange, but it's actually the usual case in human history, and it's how pretty much all wild animals have ever lived, so we know what humans do in this situation.
Humans basically do what it takes to survive, and this is what lets me say so much about the em world.
When creatures are rich, like you, you have to know a lot about what they want to figure out what they do.
When creatures are poor, you know that they mostly do what it takes to survive.
So we've been talking about the em world from the point of view of the ems -- now, let's step back and look at their whole world.
First, the em world grows much faster than ours, roughly a hundred times faster.
So the amount of change we would experience in a century or two, they would experience in a year or two.
And I'm not really willing to project this age much beyond that, because plausibly by then something else will happen, I don't know what.
Second, the typical emulation runs even faster, roughly a thousand times human speed.
So for them, they experience thousands of years in this year or two, and for them, the world around them is actually changing more slowly than your world seems to change for you.
Third, ems are crammed together in a small number of very dense cities.
This is not only how they see themselves in virtual reality, it's also how they actually are physically crammed together.
So at em speeds, physical travel feels really painfully slow, so most em cities are self-sufficient, most war is cyber war, and most of the rest of the earth away from the em cities is left to the humans, because the ems really aren't that interested in it.
Speaking of humans, you were wanting to hear about that.
Humans must retire, at once, for good.
They just can't compete.
Now, humans start out owning all of the capital in this world.
The economy grows very fast, their wealth grows very fast.
Humans get rich, collectively.
As you may know, most humans today don't actually own that much besides their ability to work, so between now and then, they need to acquire sufficient assets, insurance or sharing arrangements, or they may starve.
I highly recommend avoiding this outcome.
(Laughter)
Now, you might wonder, why would ems let humans exist?
Why not kill them, take their stuff?
But notice we have many unproductive retirees around us today, and we don't kill them and take their stuff.
(Laughter)
In part, that's because it would disrupt the institutions we share with them.
Other groups would wonder who's next, so plausibly, ems may well let humans retire in peace during the age of em.
You should worry more that the age of em only lasts a year or two and you don't know what happens next.
Ems are very much like humans, but they are not like the typical human.
The typical em is a copy of the few hundred most productive humans.
So in fact, they are as elite, compared to the typical human, as the typical billionaire, Nobel Prize winner, Olympic gold medalist, head of state.
Ems look on humans perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude, but not so much respect, which is, if you think about it, how you think about your ancestors.
We know many things about how humans differ in terms of productivity.
We can just use those to predict features of ems -- for example, they tend to be smart, conscientious, hard-working, married, religious, middle-aged.
These are features of ems.
Em world also contains enormous variety.
Not only does it continue on with most of the kinds of variety that humans do, including variety of industry and profession, they also have many new kinds of variety, and one of the most important is mind speed.
Ems can plausibly go from human speed up to a million times faster than human speed, and down to a billion times slower than human speed.
Faster ems tend to have markers of high status.
They embody more wealth. They win arguments. They sit at premium locations.
Slower ems are mostly retirees, and they are like the ghosts of our literature.
If you recall, ghosts are all around us -- you can interact with them if you pay the price.
But they don't know much, they can't influence much, and they're obsessed with the past, so what's the point?
(Laughter)
Ems also have more variety in the structure of their lives.
This is your life: you start and you end, really simple. This is the life of an em, who every day splits off some short-term copies to do short-term tasks and then end.
We'll talk more about those short term versions in a moment, but they are much more efficient because they don't have to rest for the next day.
This em is more opportunistic.
They make more copies of themselves when there's more demand for that.
They don't know which way the future's going.
This is an em designer, who conceives of a large system and then breaks recursively into copies who elaborate that, so ems can implement larger, more coherent designs.
This an emulation plumber who remembers that every day, for the last 20 years, they only ever worked two hours a day, a life of leisure.
But what really happened is, every day they had a thousand copies, each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job, and only one of them went on to the next day.
Objectively, they're working well over 99 percent of the time.
Subjectively, they remember a life of leisure.
(Laughter)
This, again, is you. You start and you end.
This could be you if at the start of party, you took a drug that meant you would not remember that party ever after that day.
Some people do this, I'm told.
Toward the end of the party, will you say to yourself, "I'm about to die, this is terrible.
That person tomorrow isn't me, because they won't remember what I do. "Or you could say," I will go on tomorrow.
I just won't remember what I did. "This is an em who splits off a short-term copy to do a short-term task and then end.
They have the same two attitude possibilities.
They can say, "I'm a new short-term creature with a short life. I hate this." Or "I'm a part of a larger creature who won't remember this part." I predict they'll have that second attitude, not because it's philosophically correct, but because it helps them get along.
Today, if the president says we must invade Iraq, and you say, "Why?" and they say, "State secret," you're not sure if you can trust them, but for ems, a copy of the president and a copy of you can go inside a safe, explain all their secret reasons, and then one bit comes out from your copy to yourself, telling you if you were convinced.
So now you can know there is a good reason.
I know you guys are all eager to evaluate this world. You're eager to decide if you love it or hate it.
But think: your ancestors from thousands of years ago would have loved or hated your world based on the first few things they heard about it, because your world is really just weird.
So before judging a strange future world, you should really learn a lot about it, maybe read a whole book about it, and then, if you don't like it, work to change it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Whether you like it or not, radical transparency and algorithmic decision-making is coming at you fast, and it's going to change your life.
That's because it's now easy to take algorithms and embed them into computers and gather all that data that you're leaving on yourself all over the place, and know what you're like, and then direct the computers to interact with you in ways that are better than most people can.
Well, that might sound scary.
I've been doing this for a long time and I have found it to be wonderful.
My objective has been to have meaningful work and meaningful relationships with the people I work with, and I've learned that I couldn't have that unless I had that radical transparency and that algorithmic decision-making.
I want to show you why that is, I want to show you how it works.
And I warn you that some of the things that I'm going to show you probably are a little bit shocking.
Since I was a kid, I've had a terrible rote memory. And I didn't like following instructions, I was no good at following instructions.
But I loved to figure out how things worked for myself.
When I was 12, I hated school but I fell in love with trading the markets.
I caddied at the time, earned about five dollars a bag. And I took my caddying money, and I put it in the stock market.
And that was just because the stock market was hot at the time.
And the first company I bought was a company by the name of Northeast Airlines.
Northeast Airlines was the only company I heard of that was selling for less than five dollars a share.
(Laughter)
And I figured I could buy more shares, and if it went up, I'd make more money. So, it was a dumb strategy, right?
But I tripled my money, and I tripled my money because I got lucky.
The company was about to go bankrupt, but some other company acquired it, and I tripled my money.
And I was hooked.
And I thought, "This game is easy." With time, I learned this game is anything but easy.
In order to be an effective investor, one has to bet against the consensus and be right.
And it's not easy to bet against the consensus and be right.
One has to bet against the consensus and be right because the consensus is built into the price.
And in order to be an entrepreneur, a successful entrepreneur, one has to bet against the consensus and be right.
I had to be an entrepreneur and an investor -- and what goes along with that is making a lot of painful mistakes.
So I made a lot of painful mistakes, and with time, my attitude about those mistakes began to change.
I began to think of them as puzzles.
That if I could solve the puzzles, they would give me gems.
And the puzzles were: What would I do differently in the future so I wouldn't make that painful mistake?
And the gems were principles that I would then write down so I would remember them that would help me in the future.
And because I wrote them down so clearly, I could then -- eventually discovered -- I could then embed them into algorithms. And those algorithms would be embedded in computers, and the computers would make decisions along with me; and so in parallel, we would make these decisions.
And I could see how those decisions then compared with my own decisions, and I could see that those decisions were a lot better.
And that was because the computer could make decisions much faster, it could process a lot more information and it can process decisions much more -- less emotionally.
So it radically improved my decision-making.
Eight years after I started Bridgewater, I had my greatest failure, my greatest mistake.
It was late 1970s, I was 34 years old, and I had calculated that American banks had lent much more money to emerging countries than those countries were going to be able to pay back and that we would have the greatest debt crisis since the Great Depression.
And with it, an economic crisis and a big bear market in stocks.
It was a controversial view at the time.
People thought it was kind of a crazy point of view.
But in August 1982, Mexico defaulted on its debt, and a number of other countries followed.
And we had the greatest debt crisis since the Great Depression.
And because I had anticipated that, I was asked to testify to Congress and appear on "Wall Street Week," which was the show of the time.
Just to give you a flavor of that, I've got a clip here, and you'll see me in there.
(Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell, it's a great pleasure and a great honor to be able to appear before you in examination with what is going wrong with our economy.
The economy is now flat -- teetering on the brink of failure.
Martin Zweig: You were recently quoted in an article.
You said, "I can say this with absolute certainty because I know how markets work."
Ray Dalio: I can say with absolute certainty that if you look at the liquidity base in the corporations and the world as a whole, that there's such reduced level of liquidity that you can't return to an era of stagflation."
I look at that now, I think, "What an arrogant jerk!"
(Laughter) I was so arrogant, and I was so wrong.
I mean, while the debt crisis happened, the stock market and the economy went up rather than going down, and I lost so much money for myself and for my clients that I had to shut down my operation pretty much, I had to let almost everybody go.
And these were like extended family, I was heartbroken.
And I had lost so much money that I had to borrow 4,000 dollars from my dad to help to pay my family bills.
It was one of the most painful experiences of my life ... but it turned out to be one of the greatest experiences of my life because it changed my attitude about decision-making.
Rather than thinking, "I'm right," I started to ask myself, "How do I know I'm right?" I gained a humility that I needed in order to balance my audacity.
I wanted to find the smartest people who would disagree with me to try to understand their perspective or to have them stress test my perspective.
I wanted to make an idea meritocracy.
In other words, not an autocracy in which I would lead and others would follow and not a democracy in which everybody's points of view were equally valued, but I wanted to have an idea meritocracy in which the best ideas would win out.
And in order to do that, I realized that we would need radical truthfulness and radical transparency.
What I mean by radical truthfulness and radical transparency is people needed to say what they really believed and to see everything.
And we literally tape almost all conversations and let everybody see everything, because if we didn't do that, we couldn't really have an idea meritocracy.
In order to have an idea meritocracy, we have let people speak and say what they want.
Just to give you an example, this is an email from Jim Haskel -- somebody who works for me -- and this was available to everybody in the company. "Ray, you deserve a 'D-' for your performance today in the meeting ... you did not prepare at all well because there is no way you could have been that disorganized." Isn't that great?
(Laughter)
That's great. It's great because, first of all, I needed feedback like that.
I need feedback like that.
And it's great because if I don't let Jim, and people like Jim, to express their points of view, our relationship wouldn't be the same.
And if I didn't make that public for everybody to see, we wouldn't have an idea meritocracy.
So for that last 25 years that's how we've been operating.
We've been operating with this radical transparency and then collecting these principles, largely from making mistakes, and then embedding those principles into algorithms.
And then those algorithms provide -- we're following the algorithms in parallel with our thinking.
That has been how we've run the investment business, and it's how we also deal with the people management.
In order to give you a glimmer into what this looks like, I'd like to take you into a meeting and introduce you to a tool of ours called the "Dot Collector" that helps us do this.
A week after the US election, our research team held a meeting to discuss what a Trump presidency would mean for the US economy.
Naturally, people had different opinions on the matter and how we were approaching the discussion. The "Dot Collector" collects these views.
It has a list of a few dozen attributes, so whenever somebody thinks something about another person's thinking, it's easy for them to convey their assessment; they simply note the attribute and provide a rating from one to 10.
For example, as the meeting began, a researcher named Jen rated me a three — in other words, badly —
(Laughter) for not showing a good balance of open-mindedness and assertiveness.
As the meeting transpired, Jen's assessments of people added up like this.
Others in the room have different opinions. That's normal. Different people are always going to have different opinions.
And who knows who's right?
Let's look at just what people thought about how I was doing.
Some people thought I did well, others, poorly. With each of these views, we can explore the thinking behind the numbers.
Here's what Jen and Larry said.
Note that everyone gets to express their thinking, including their critical thinking, regardless of their position in the company.
Jen, who's 24 years old and right out of college, can tell me, the CEO, that I'm approaching things terribly.
This tool helps people both express their opinions and then separate themselves from their opinions to see things from a higher level.
When Jen and others shift their attentions from inputting their own opinions to looking down on the whole screen, their perspective changes.
They see their own opinions as just one of many and naturally start asking themselves, "How do I know my opinion is right?" That shift in perspective is like going from seeing in one dimension to seeing in multiple dimensions. And it shifts the conversation from arguing over our opinions to figuring out objective criteria for determining which opinions are best.
Behind the "Dot Collector" is a computer that is watching. It watches what all these people are thinking and it correlates that with how they think.
And it communicates advice back to each of them based on that.
Then it draws the data from all the meetings to create a pointilist painting of what people are like and how they think.
And it does that guided by algorithms.
Knowing what people are like helps to match them better with their jobs.
For example, a creative thinker who is unreliable might be matched up with someone who's reliable but not creative.
Knowing what people are like also allows us to decide what responsibilities to give them and to weigh our decisions based on people's merits.
We call it their believability.
Here's an example of a vote that we took where the majority of people felt one way ... but when we weighed the views based on people's merits, the answer was completely different.
This process allows us to make decisions not based on democracy, not based on autocracy, but based on algorithms that take people's believability into consideration.
Yup, we really do this.
(Laughter)
We do it because it eliminates what I believe to be one of the greatest tragedies of mankind, and that is people arrogantly, naïvely holding opinions in their minds that are wrong, and acting on them, and not putting them out there to stress test them.
And that's a tragedy.
And we do it because it elevates ourselves above our own opinions so that we start to see things through everybody's eyes, and we see things collectively.
Collective decision-making is so much better than individual decision-making if it's done well.
It's been the secret sauce behind our success.
It's why we've made more money for our clients than any other hedge fund in existence and made money 23 out of the last 26 years.
So what's the problem with being radically truthful and radically transparent with each other?
People say it's emotionally difficult.
Critics say it's a formula for a brutal work environment.
Neuroscientists tell me it has to do with how are brains are prewired.
There's a part of our brain that would like to know our mistakes and like to look at our weaknesses so we could do better.
I'm told that that's the prefrontal cortex.
And then there's a part of our brain which views all of this as attacks.
I'm told that that's the amygdala.
In other words, there are two you's inside you: there's an emotional you and there's an intellectual you, and often they're at odds, and often they work against you.
It's been our experience that we can win this battle.
We win it as a group.
It takes about 18 months typically to find that most people prefer operating this way, with this radical transparency than to be operating in a more opaque environment.
There's not politics, there's not the brutality of -- you know, all of that hidden, behind-the-scenes -- there's an idea meritocracy where people can speak up. And that's been great. It's given us more effective work, and it's given us more effective relationships.
But it's not for everybody.
We found something like 25 or 30 percent of the population it's just not for.
And by the way, when I say radical transparency, I'm not saying transparency about everything.
I mean, you don't have to tell somebody that their bald spot is growing or their baby's ugly.
So, I'm just talking about --
(Laughter)
talking about the important things. So --
So when you leave this room, I'd like you to observe yourself in conversations with others.
Imagine if you knew what they were really thinking, and imagine if you knew what they were really like ... and imagine if they knew what you were really thinking and what were really like.
It would certainly clear things up a lot and make your operations together more effective.
I think it will improve your relationships.
Now imagine that you can have algorithms that will help you gather all of that information and even help you make decisions in an idea-meritocratic way.
This sort of radical transparency is coming at you and it is going to affect your life.
And in my opinion, it's going to be wonderful.
So I hope it is as wonderful for you as it is for me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So I want to start this talk by showing y'all a photo, and it's a photo many of you have probably seen before.
So I want you all to take a moment and look at this photo, and really reflect on some of the things that come to mind, and what are some of those things, those words.
Now, I'm going to ask you all to look at me.
What words come to mind when you look at me?
What separates that man up there from me?
The man in that photo is named David Kirby and it was taken in 1990 as he was dying from AIDS-related illness, and it was subsequently published in "Life Magazine." The only real thing separating me from Kirby is about 30 years of medical advancements in the way that we treat HIV and AIDS.
So what I want to ask next is this: If we have made such exponential progress in combatting HIV, why haven't our perceptions of those with the virus evolved alongside?
Why does HIV elicit this reaction from us when it's so easily managed?
When did the stigmatization even occur, and why hasn't it subsided?
And these are not easy questions to answer.
They're the congealing of so many different factors and ideas.
Powerful images, like this one of Kirby, these were the faces of the AIDS crisis in the '80s and '90s, and at the time the crisis had a very obvious impact on an already stigmatized group of people, and that was gay men.
So what the general straight public saw was this very awful thing happening to a group of people who were already on the fringes of society.
The media at the time began to use the two almost interchangeably -- gay and AIDS -- and at the 1984 Republican National Convention, one of the speakers joked that gay stood for: "Got AIDS yet?" And that was the mindset at the time.
But as we started to understand the virus more and how it was transmitted, we realized that that risk had increased its territory.
The highly profiled case of Ryan White in 1985, who was a 13-year-old hemophiliac who had contracted HIV from a contaminated blood treatment, and this marked the most profound shift in America's perception of HIV.
No longer was it restricted to these dark corners of society, to queers and drug users, but now it was affecting people that society deemed worthy of their empathy, to children.
But that permeating fear and that perception, it still lingers.
And I want a show of hands for these next few questions.
How many of you in here were aware that with treatment, those with HIV not only fend off AIDS completely, but they live full and normal lives?
Y'all are educated.
(Laughter)
How many of you are aware that with treatment, those with HIV can reach an undetectable status, and that makes them virtually uninfectious? Much less. How many of you were aware of the pre- and postexposure treatments that are available that reduce the risk of transmission by over 90 percent?
See, these are incredible advancements that we have made in fighting HIV, yet they have not managed to dent the perception that most Americans have of the virus and those living with it.
And I don't want you to think I'm downplaying the danger of this virus, and I am not ignorant of the harrowing past of the AIDS epidemic.
I am trying to convey that there is hope for those infected and HIV is not the death sentence it was in the '80s.
And now you may ask, and I asked this question myself initially: Where are the stories?
Where are these people living with HIV?
Why haven't they been vocal?
How can I believe these successes, or these statistics, without seeing the successes?
And this is actually a very easy question for me to answer.
Fear, stigma and shame: these keep those living with HIV in the closet, so to speak.
Our sexual histories are as personal to us as our medical histories, and when you overlap the two, you can find yourself in a very sensitive space.
The fear of how others perceive us when we're honest keeps us from doing many things in life, and this is the case for the HIV-positive population.
To face social scrutiny and ridicule is the price that we pay for transparency, and why become a martyr when you can effectively pass as someone without HIV?
After all, there are no physical indications you have the virus.
There's no sign that you wear.
There is safety in assimilation, and there is safety in invisibility.
I'm here to throw back that veil and share my story.
So in the fall of 2014, I was a sophomore in college and like most college students, I was sexually active, and I generally took precautions to minimize the risk that sex carries.
Now, I say generally, because I wasn't always safe.
It only takes a single misstep before we're flat on the ground, and my misstep is pretty obvious.
I had unprotected sex, and I didn't think much of it.
Fast-forward about three weeks, and it felt like I'd been trampled by a herd of wildebeest.
The aches in my body were like nothing I have felt before or since.
I would get these bouts of fever and chill.
I would reel with nausea, and it was difficult to walk.
Being a biology student, I had some prior exposure to disease, and being a fairly informed gay man, I had read a bit on HIV, so to me, it clicked that this was seroconversion, or as it's sometimes called, acute HIV infection.
And this is the body's reaction in producing antibodies to the HIV antigen.
It's important to note that not everybody goes through this phase of sickness, but I was one of the lucky ones who did.
And I was lucky as in, there were these physical symptoms that let me know, hey, something is wrong, and it let me detect the virus pretty early.
So just to clarify, just to hit the nail on head, I got tested on campus.
And they said they would call me the next morning with the results, and they called me, but they asked me to come in and speak to the doctor on staff.
And the reaction I received from her wasn't what I was expecting.
She reassured me what I already knew, that this wasn't a death sentence, and she even offered to put me in contact with her brother, who had been living with HIV since the early '90s.
I declined her offer, but I was deeply touched.
I was expecting to be reprimanded.
I was expecting pity and disappointment, and I was shown compassion and human warmth, and I'm forever grateful for that first exchange.
So obviously for a few weeks, I was a physical mess.
Emotionally, mentally, I was doing OK.
I was taking it well.
But my body was ravaged, and those close to me, they weren't oblivious.
So I sat my roommates down, and I let them know I'd been diagnosed with HIV, that I was about to receive treatment, and I didn't want them to worry.
And I remember the look on their faces.
They were holding each other on the couch and they were crying, and I consoled them.
I consoled them about my own bad news, but it was heartwarming to see that they cared.
But from that night, I noticed a shift in the way that I was treated at home.
My roommates wouldn't touch anything of mine, and they wouldn't eat anything I had cooked.
Now, in South Louisiana, we all know that you don't refuse food.
(Laughter)
And I'm a damn good cook, so don't think that passed me by.
(Laughter)
But from these first silent hints, their aversion got gradually more obvious and more offensive.
I was asked to move my toothbrush from the bathroom, I was asked to not share towels, and I was even asked to wash my clothes on a hotter setting.
This wasn't head lice, y'all.
This wasn't scabies. This was HIV. It can be transmitted through blood, sexual fluids like semen or vaginal fluids and breast milk.
Since I wasn't sleeping with my roommates, I wasn't breastfeeding them --
(Laughter)
and we weren't reenacting "Twilight," I was of no risk to them and I made this aware to them, but still, this discomfort, it continued, until eventually I was asked to move out.
And I was asked to move out because one of my roommates had shared my status with her parents.
She shared my personal medical information to strangers.
And now I'm doing that in a roomful of 300 of y'all, but at the time, this was not something I was comfortable with, and they expressed their discomfort with their daughter living with me.
So being gay, raised in a religious household and living in the South, discrimination wasn't new to me.
But this form was, and it was tremendously disappointing because it came from such an unlikely source.
Not only were these college-educated people, not only were they other members of the LGBT community, but they were also my friends. So I did. I moved out at the end of the semester.
But it wasn't to appease them.
It was out of respect for myself.
I wasn't going to subject myself to people who were unwilling to remedy their ignorance, and I wasn't going to let something that was now a part of me ever be used as a tool against me.
So I opted for transparency about my status, always being visible.
And this is what I like to call being the everyday advocate.
The point of this transparency, the point of this everyday advocacy, was to dispel ignorance, and ignorance is a very scary word.
We don't want to be seen as ignorant, and we definitely don't want to be called it.
But ignorance is not synonymous with stupid.
It's not the inability to learn.
It's the state you're in before you learn.
So when I saw someone coming from a place of ignorance, I saw an opportunity for them to learn.
And hopefully, if I could spread some education, then I could mitigate situations for others like I had experienced with my roommates and save someone else down the line that humiliation.
So the reactions I received haven't been all positive.
Here in the South, we have a lot stigma due to religious pressures, our lack of a comprehensive sex education and our general conservative outlook on anything sexual.
We view this as a gay disease.
Globally, most new HIV infections occur between heterosexual partners, and here in the States, women, especially women of color, are at an increased risk.
This is not a gay disease.
It never has been.
It's a disease we should all be concerned with.
So initially, I felt limited.
I wanted to expand my scope and reach beyond what was around me.
So naturally, I turned to the dark underworld of online dating apps, to apps like Grindr, and for those of you who are unfamiliar, these are dating apps targeted towards gay men.
You can upload a profile and a picture and it will show you available guys within a radius.
Y'all have probably heard of Tinder.
Grindr has been around for a lot longer, since it was much harder to meet your future gay husband at church or the grocery store, or whatever straight people did before they found out they could date on their phones.
(Laughter)
So on Grindr, if you liked what you saw or read, you could send someone a message, you can meet up, you can do other things.
So on my profile, I obviously stated that I had HIV, I was undetectable, and I welcomed questions about my status.
And I received a lot of questions and a lot of comments, both positive and negative.
And I want to start with the negative, just to frame some of this ignorance that I've mentioned before.
And most of these negative comments were passing remarks or assumptions.
They would assume things about my sex life or my sex habits. They would assume I put myself or others at risk.
But very often I would just be met with these passing ignorant remarks.
In the gay community, it's common to hear the word "clean" when you're referring to someone who is HIV negative.
Of course the flip side to that is being unclean, or dirty, when you do have HIV.
Now, I'm not sensitive and I'm only truly dirty after a day in the field, but this is damaging language.
This is a community-driven stigma that keeps many gay men from disclosing their status, and it keeps those newly diagnosed from seeking support within their own community, and I find that truly distressing.
But thankfully, the positive responses have been a lot more numerous, and they came from guys who were curious.
And they were curious about the risks of transmission, or what exactly "undetectable" meant, or where they could get tested, or some guys would ask me about my experiences, and I could share my story with them.
But most importantly, I would get approached by guys who were newly diagnosed with HIV and they were scared, and they were alone, and they didn't know what step to take next.
They didn't want to tell their family, they didn't want to tell their friends and they felt damaged, and they felt dirty.
And I did whatever I could to immediately calm them, and then I would put them in contact with AcadianaCares, which is a wonderful resource we have in our community for those with HIV.
And I'd put them in contact with people I knew personally so that they could not only have this safe space to feel human again, but so they could also have the resources they needed in affording their treatment.
And this was by far the most humbling aspect of my transparency, that I could have some positive impact on those who were suffering like I did, that I could help those who were in the dark, because I had been there, and it wasn't a good place to be.
These guys came from all different backgrounds, and many of them weren't as informed as I had been, and they were coming to me from a place of fear.
Some of these people I knew personally, or they knew of me, but many more, they were anonymous.
They were these blank profiles who were too afraid to show their faces after what they had told me.
And on the topic of transparency, I want to leave y'all with a few thoughts.
I found that with whatever risk or gamble I took in putting my face out there, it was well worth any negative comment, any flak I received, because I felt I was able to make this real and this tangible impact.
And it showed me that our efforts resound, that we can alter the lives that we encounter for the good, and they in turn can take that momentum and push it even further.
And if any of you or anyone you know is dealing with HIV, or if you want to see what resources you have in your community, or just educate yourself more on the disease, here are some wonderful national sites that you can access and you are more than welcome to find me after this talk and ask me anything you'd like.
We've all heard the phrase "to see the forest through the trees," so I implore all of you here to really see the human through the disease.
It's a very easy thing to see numbers and statistics and only see the perceived dangers.
It's a much harder thing to see all the faces behind those numbers.
So when you find yourself thinking those things, those words, what you might have thought looking at David Kirby, I ask you instead, think son, or think brother, think friend and most importantly, think human.
Seek education when faced with ignorance, and always be mindful, and always be compassionate.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I used to think the whole purpose of life was pursuing happiness.
Everyone said the path to happiness was success, so I searched for that ideal job, that perfect boyfriend, that beautiful apartment.
But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, I felt anxious and adrift.
And I wasn't alone; my friends -- they struggled with this, too.
Eventually, I decided to go to graduate school for positive psychology to learn what truly makes people happy.
But what I discovered there changed my life.
The data showed that chasing happiness can make people unhappy.
And what really struck me was this: the suicide rate has been rising around the world, and it recently reached a 30-year high in America.
Even though life is getting objectively better by nearly every conceivable standard, more people feel hopeless, depressed and alone.
There's an emptiness gnawing away at people, and you don't have to be clinically depressed to feel it.
Sooner or later, I think we all wonder: Is this all there is?
And according to the research, what predicts this despair is not a lack of happiness.
It's a lack of something else, a lack of having meaning in life.
But that raised some questions for me.
Is there more to life than being happy?
And what's the difference between being happy and having meaning in life?
Many psychologists define happiness as a state of comfort and ease, feeling good in the moment.
Meaning, though, is deeper.
The renowned psychologist Martin Seligman says meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you.
Our culture is obsessed with happiness, but I came to see that seeking meaning is the more fulfilling path.
And the studies show that people who have meaning in life, they're more resilient, they do better in school and at work, and they even live longer.
So this all made me wonder: How can we each live more meaningfully?
To find out, I spent five years interviewing hundreds of people and reading through thousands of pages of psychology, neuroscience and philosophy.
Bringing it all together, I found that there are what I call four pillars of a meaningful life.
And we can each create lives of meaning by building some or all of these pillars in our lives.
The first pillar is belonging.
Belonging comes from being in relationships where you're valued for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well.
But some groups and relationships deliver a cheap form of belonging; you're valued for what you believe, for who you hate, not for who you are.
True belonging springs from love.
It lives in moments among individuals, and it's a choice -- you can choose to cultivate belonging with others.
Here's an example. Each morning, my friend Jonathan buys a newspaper from the same street vendor in New York.
They don't just conduct a transaction, though.
They take a moment to slow down, talk, and treat each other like humans.
But one time, Jonathan didn't have the right change, and the vendor said, "Don't worry about it." But Jonathan insisted on paying, so he went to the store and bought something he didn't need to make change.
But when he gave the money to the vendor, the vendor drew back. He was hurt. He was trying to do something kind, but Jonathan had rejected him.
I think we all reject people in small ways like this without realizing it. I do. I'll walk by someone I know and barely acknowledge them.
I'll check my phone when someone's talking to me.
These acts devalue others.
They make them feel invisible and unworthy.
But when you lead with love, you create a bond that lifts each of you up.
For many people, belonging is the most essential source of meaning, those bonds to family and friends.
For others, the key to meaning is the second pillar: purpose.
Now, finding your purpose is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy.
Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give.
A hospital custodian told me her purpose is healing sick people.
Many parents tell me, "My purpose is raising my children." The key to purpose is using your strengths to serve others.
Of course, for many of us, that happens through work.
That's how we contribute and feel needed.
But that also means that issues like disengagement at work, unemployment, low labor force participation -- these aren't just economic problems, they're existential ones, too.
Without something worthwhile to do, people flounder.
Of course, you don't have to find purpose at work, but purpose gives you something to live for, some "why" that drives you forward.
The third pillar of meaning is also about stepping beyond yourself, but in a completely different way: transcendence.
Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected to a higher reality.
For one person I talked to, transcendence came from seeing art. For another person, it was at church.
For me, I'm a writer, and it happens through writing.
Sometimes I get so in the zone that I lose all sense of time and place.
These transcendent experiences can change you.
One study had students look up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute.
But afterwards they felt less self-centered, and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone.
Belonging, purpose, transcendence.
Now, the fourth pillar of meaning, I've found, tends to surprise people.
The fourth pillar is storytelling, the story you tell yourself about yourself.
Creating a narrative from the events of your life brings clarity.
It helps you understand how you became you.
But we don't always realize that we're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them.
Your life isn't just a list of events.
You can edit, interpret and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts.
I met a young man named Emeka, who'd been paralyzed playing football.
After his injury, Emeka told himself, "My life was great playing football, but now look at me." People who tell stories like this — "My life was good.
Now it's bad. "— tend to be more anxious and depressed.
And that was Emeka for a while.
But with time, he started to weave a different story.
His new story was, "Before my injury, my life was purposeless.
I partied a lot and was a pretty selfish guy.
But my injury made me realize I could be a better man." That edit to his story changed Emeka's life.
After telling the new story to himself, Emeka started mentoring kids, and he discovered what his purpose was: serving others.
The psychologist Dan McAdams calls this a "redemptive story," where the bad is redeemed by the good.
People leading meaningful lives, he's found, tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption, growth and love.
But what makes people change their stories?
Some people get help from a therapist, but you can do it on your own, too, just by reflecting on your life thoughtfully, how your defining experiences shaped you, what you lost, what you gained.
That's what Emeka did.
You won't change your story overnight; it could take years and be painful.
After all, we've all suffered, and we all struggle.
But embracing those painful memories can lead to new insights and wisdom, to finding that good that sustains you.
Belonging, purpose, transcendence, storytelling: those are the four pillars of meaning.
When I was younger, I was lucky enough to be surrounded by all of the pillars.
My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse from our home in Montreal.
Sufism is a spiritual practice associated with the whirling dervishes and the poet Rumi.
Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home to meditate, drink Persian tea, and share stories.
Their practice also involved serving all of creation through small acts of love, which meant being kind even when people wronged you.
But it gave them a purpose: to rein in the ego.
Eventually, I left home for college and without the daily grounding of Sufism in my life, I felt unmoored.
And I started searching for those things that make life worth living.
That's what set me on this journey.
Looking back, I now realize that the Sufi house had a real culture of meaning.
The pillars were part of the architecture, and the presence of the pillars helped us all live more deeply.
Of course, the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones.
Gangs, cults: these are cultures of meaning that use the pillars and give people something to live and die for.
But that's exactly why we as a society must offer better alternatives.
We need to build these pillars within our families and our institutions to help people become their best selves.
But living a meaningful life takes work.
It's an ongoing process.
As each day goes by, we're constantly creating our lives, adding to our story.
And sometimes we can get off track.
Whenever that happens to me, I remember a powerful experience I had with my father.
Several months after I graduated from college, my dad had a massive heart attack that should have killed him.
He survived, and when I asked him what was going through his mind as he faced death, he said all he could think about was needing to live so he could be there for my brother and me, and this gave him the will to fight for life.
When he went under anesthesia for emergency surgery, instead of counting backwards from 10, he repeated our names like a mantra.
He wanted our names to be the last words he spoke on earth if he died.
My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.
It's a humble life, but a good life.
Lying there facing death, he had a reason to live: love.
His sense of belonging within his family, his purpose as a dad, his transcendent meditation, repeating our names -- these, he says, are the reasons why he survived.
That's the story he tells himself.
That's the power of meaning.
Happiness comes and goes.
But when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you something to hold on to.
Thank you.
(Applause)
As you heard, I'm a physicist. And I think the way we talk about physics needs a little modification.
I am from just down the road here; I don't live here anymore.
But coming from round here means that I have a northern nana, my mum's mom.
And Nana is very bright; she hasn't had much formal education, but she's sharp.
And when I was a second-year undergraduate studying physics at Cambridge, I remember spending an afternoon at Nana's house in Urmston studying quantum mechanics.
And I had these folders open in front of me with this, you know, hieroglyphics -- let's be honest.
And Nana came along, and she looked at this folder, and she said, "What's that?" I said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana." And I tried to explain something about what was on the page.
It was to do with the nucleus and Einstein A and B coefficients.
And Nana looked very impressed.
And then she said, "Oh.
What can you do when you know that?"
(Laughter)
I think I said something about computers, because it was all I could think of at the time.
But you can broaden that question out, because it's a very good question — "What can you do when you know that?" when "that" is physics? And I've come to realize that when we talk about physics in society and our sort of image of it, we don't include the things that we can do when we know that.
Our perception of what physics is needs a bit of a shift.
Not only does it need a bit of a shift, but sharing this different perspective matters for our society, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a physicist and I'm biased and I think we're the most important people in the world. Honest.
So, the image of physics -- we've got an image problem, let's be honest -- it hasn't moved on much from this.
This is a very famous photograph that's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.
This is when the great minds of physics were grappling with the nature of determinism and what it means only to have a probability that a particle might be somewhere, and whether any of it was real.
And it was all very difficult.
And you'll notice they're all very stern-looking men in suits.
Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying, "Marie Antoinette," which would be a turn-up for the books -- Marie Curie, third from the left on the bottom there, she was allowed in, but had to dress like everybody else.
(Laughter)
So, this is what physics is like -- there's all these kinds of hieroglyphics, these are to do with waves and particles.
That is an artist's impression of two black holes colliding, which makes it look worth watching, to be honest.
I'm glad I didn't have to write the risk assessment for whatever was going on there.
The point is: this is the image of physics, right?
It's weird and difficult, done by slightly strange people dressed in a slightly strange way.
It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else and fundamentally, why should I care?
And the problem with that is that I'm a physicist, and I study this.
This -- this is my job, right?
I study the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean.
The atmosphere is massive, the ocean is massive, and the thin layer that joins them together is really important, because that's where things go from one huge reservoir to the other.
You can see that the sea surface -- that was me who took this video -- the average height of those waves by the way, was 10 meters.
So this is definitely physics happening here -- there's lots of things -- this is definitely physics.
And yet it's not included in our cultural perception of physics, and that bothers me.
So what is included in our cultural perception of physics?
Because I'm a physicist, there has to be a graph, right? That's allowed. We've got time along the bottom here, from very fast things there, to things that take a long time over here.
Small things at the bottom, big things up there.
So, our current cultural image of physics looks like this.
There's quantum mechanics down in that corner, it's very small, it's very weird, it happens very quickly, and it's a long way down in the general ... on the scale of anything that matters for everyday life.
And then there's cosmology, which is up there; very large, very far away, also very weird.
And if you go to some places like black holes in the beginning of the universe, we know that these are frontiers in physics, right?
There's lots of work being done to discover new physics in these places.
But the thing is, you will notice there's a very large gap in the middle.
And in that gap, there are many things.
There are planets and toasts and volcanoes and clouds and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins and all sorts of things that make up our everyday life.
And these are also run by physics, you'd be surprised — there is physics in the middle, it's just that nobody talks about it.
And the thing about all of these is that they all run on a relatively small number of physical laws, things like Newton's laws of motion, thermodynamics, some rotational dynamics.
The physics in the middle applies over a huge range, from very, very small things to very, very big things.
You have to try very hard to get outside of this.
And there is also a frontier in research physics here, it's just that nobody talks about it.
This is the world of the complex.
When these laws work together, they bring about the beautiful, messy, complex world we live in.
Fundamentally, this is the bit that really matters to me on an everyday basis.
And this is the bit that we don't talk about.
There's plenty of physics research going on here.
But because it doesn't involve pointing at stars, people for some reason think it's not that.
Now, the cool thing about this is that there are so many things in this middle bit, all following the same physical laws, that we can see those laws at work almost all the time around us.
I've got a little video here.
So the game is, one of these eggs is raw and one of them has been boiled.
I want you to tell me which one is which. Which one's raw?
(Audience responds)
The one on the left -- yes!
And even though you might not have tried that, you all knew.
The reason for that is, you set them spinning, and when you stop the cooked egg, the one that's completely solid, you stop the entire egg.
When you stop the other one, you only stop the shell; the liquid inside is still rotating because nothing's made it stop.
And then it pushes the shell round again, so the egg starts to rotate again.
This is brilliant, right?
It's a demonstration of something in physics that we call the law of conservation of angular momentum, which basically says that if you set something spinning about a fixed axis, that it will keep spinning unless you do something to stop it.
And that's really fundamental in how the universe works.
And it's not just eggs that it applies to, although it's really useful if you're the sort of person -- and apparently, these people do exist -- who will boil eggs and then put them back in the fridge. Who does that? Don't admit to it -- it's OK. We won't judge you. But it's also got much broader applicabilities.
This is the Hubble Space Telescope.
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, which is a very tiny part of the sky.
Hubble has been floating in free space for 25 years, not touching anything.
And yet it can point to a tiny region of sky.
For 11 and a half days, it did it in sections, accurately enough to take amazing images like this.
So the question is: How does something that is not touching anything know where it is?
The answer is that right in the middle of it, it has something that, to my great disappointment, isn't a raw egg, but basically does the same job.
It's got gyroscopes which are spinning, and because of the law of conservation of angular momentum, they keep spinning with the same axis, indefinitely.
Hubble kind of rotates around them, and so it can orient itself.
So the same little physical law we can play with in the kitchen and use, also explains what makes possible some of the most advanced technology of our time.
So this is the fun bit of physics, that you learn these patterns and then you can apply them again and again and again.
And it's really rewarding when you spot them in new places.
This is the fun of physics.
I have shown that egg video to an audience full of businesspeople once and they were all dressed up very smartly and trying to impress their bosses.
And I was running out of time, so I showed the egg video and then said, "Well, you can work it out, and ask me afterwards to check." Then I left the stage.
And I had, literally, middle-aged grown men tugging on my sleeve afterwards, saying, "Is it this?
Is it this? "And when I said," Yes. "They went," Yes! "
The joy that you get from spot ting these patterns doesn't go away when you're an adult.
And that's really important, because physics is all about patterns, and a small number of patterns give you access to almost all of the physics in our everyday world.
The thing that's best about this is it involves playing with toys.
Things like the egg shouldn't be dismissed as the mundane little things that we just give the kids to play with on a Saturday afternoon to keep them quiet.
This is the stuff that actually really matters, because this is the laws of the universe and it applies to eggs and toast falling butter-side down and all sorts of other things, just as much as it applies to modern technology and anything else that's going on in the world.
So I think we should play with these patterns.
Basically, there are a small number of concepts that you can become familiar with using things in your kitchen, that are really useful for life in the outside world.
If you want to learn about thermodynamics, a duck is a good place to start, for example, why their feet don't get cold.
Once you've got a bit of thermodynamics with the duck, you can also explain fridges.
Magnets that you can play with in your kitchen get you to wind turbines and modern energy generation.
Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is always a good thing to play with.
If you're at a boring party, fish some raisins out of the bar snacks, put them in some lemonade.
It's got three consequences.
First thing is, it's quite good to watch; try it.
Secondly, it sends the boring people away.
Thirdly, it brings the interesting people to you.
You win on all fronts.
And then there's spin and gas laws and viscosity.
There's these little patterns, and they're right around us everywhere.
And it's fundamentally democratic, right?
Everybody has access to the same physics; you don't need a big, posh lab.
When I wrote the book, I had the chapter on spin. I had written a bit about toast falling butter-side down.
I gave the chapter to a friend of mine who's not a scientist, for him to read and tell me what he thought, and he took the chapter away.
He was working overseas.
I got this text message back from him a couple of weeks later, and it said, "I'm at breakfast in a posh hotel in Switzerland, and I really want to push toast off the table, because I don't believe what you wrote." And that was the good bit -- he doesn't have to.
He can push the toast off the table and try it for himself.
And so there's two important things to know about science: the fundamental laws we've learned through experience and experimentation, work.
The day we drop an apple and it goes up, then we'll have a debate about gravity.
Up to that point, we basically know how gravity works, and we can learn the framework.
Then there's the process of experimentation: having confidence in things, trying things out, critical thinking -- how we move science forward -- and you can learn both of those things by playing with toys in the everyday world.
And it's really important, because there's all this talk about technology, we've heard talks about quantum computing and all these mysterious, far-off things.
But fundamentally, we still live in bodies that are about this size, we still walk about, sit on chairs that are about this size, we still live in the physical world.
And being familiar with these concepts means we're not helpless.
And I think it's really important that we're not helpless, that society feels it can look at things, because this isn't about knowing all the answers. It's about having the framework so you can ask the right questions.
And by playing with these fundamental little things in everyday life, we gain the confidence to ask the right questions.
So, there's a bigger thing.
In answer to Nana's question about what can you do when you know that -- because there's lots of stuff in the everyday world that you can do when you know that, especially if you've got eggs in the fridge -- there's a much deeper answer.
And so there's all the fun and the curiosity that you could have playing with toys.
By the way -- why should kids have all the fun, right?
All of us can have fun playing with toys, and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.
You can blame me, it's fine.
So when it comes to reasons for studying physics, for example, here is the best reason I can think of: I think that each of us has three life-support systems.
We've got our own body, we've got a planet and we've got our civilization.
Each of those is an independent life-support system, keeping us alive in its own way.
And they all run on the fundamental physical laws that you can learn in the kitchen with eggs and teacups and lemonade, and everything else you can play with.
This is the reason, for example, why something like climate change is such a serious problem, because It's two of these life-support systems, our planet and our civilization, kind of butting up against each other; they're in conflict, and we need to negotiate that boundary.
And the fundamental physical laws that we can learn that are the way the world around us works, are the tools at the basis of everything; they're the foundation.
There's lots of things to know about in life, but knowing the foundations is going to get you a long way.
And I think this, if you're not interested in having fun with physics or anything like that — strange, but apparently, these people exist — you surely are interested in keeping yourself alive and in how our life-support systems work.
The framework for physics is remarkably constant; it's the same in lots and lots of things that we measure.
It's not going to change anytime soon.
They might discover some new quantum mechanics, but apples right here are still going to fall down.
So, the question is — I get asked sometimes: How do you start?
What's the place to start if you're interested in the physical world, in not being helpless, and in finding some toys to play with?
Here is my suggestion to you: the place to start is that moment — and adults do this — you're drifting along somewhere, and you spot something and your brain goes, "Oh, that's weird." And then your consciousness goes, "You're an adult.
Keep going. "And that's the point — hold that thought — that bit where your brain went," Oh, that's a bit odd, "because there's something there to play with, and it's worth you playing with it, so that's the place to start.
But if you don't have any of those little moments on your way home from this event, here are some things to start with.
Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade; highly entertaining.
Watch a coffee spill dry.
I know that sounds a little bit like watching paint dry, but it does do quite weird things; it's worth watching.
I'm an acquired taste at dinner parties if there are teacups around.
There are so many things you can do to play with teacups, it's brilliant.
The most obvious one is to get a teacup, get a spoon, tap the teacup around the rim and listen, and you will hear something strange.
And the other thing is, push your toast off the table because you can, and you'll learn stuff from it.
And if you're feeling really ambitious, try and push it off in such a way that it doesn't fall butter-side down, which is possible.
The point of all of this is that, first of all, we should all play with toys.
We shouldn't be afraid to investigate the physical world for ourselves with the tools around us, because we all have access to them.
It matters, because if we want to understand society, if we want to be good citizens, we need to understand the framework on which everything else must be based.
Playing with toys is great.
Understanding how to keep our life-support systems going is great.
But fundamentally, the thing that we need to change in the way that we talk about physics, is we need to understand that physics isn't out there with weird people and strange hieroglyphics for somebody else in a posh lab.
Physics is right here; it's for us, and we can all play with it.
Thank you very much.
[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,] [of true Ogbogbo Clan,] [whose wealth and resources surpass all that Europe ever had,] [whose altar is filled with gold.]
This chant is called the oríkì.
My grandmother used to sing it to me when I was a child in Nigeria.
See, an oríkì is the song of praise of the Yoruba people, and this particularly speaks of treasures that the West does not have.
Mama -- that's what I call my grandmother -- told me many stories about Yoruba mythology.
You see, the Yorubas are an ethnic group from the southwestern part of Nigeria, and I was always fascinated by these stories.
I was always intrigued.
And Yoruba culture has inspired my art since I was a child.
You see, African art is not just what you buy at Harlem markets in New York.
Every artist has a name, and every artist has a story. This is my story.
See, mama had tattoos on her arms and her legs.
As a child, I thought she was born with them, with beautiful black lines and detailed symbols.
And then she told me that they were actually symbols from the Yoruba mythology.
I never knew how this was going to influence the artist that I am today.
You see, as a young child, I saw art everywhere.
I remember the house we lived in in Ilorin, in Stadium Road.
We had marble floors, and you know, I would look at the marble floors, and I would see all sorts of patterns and designs in it, and I thought everybody could see them.
So I would call my brother, and I would be like, "Ikeolu, come and see this marble design, see this pattern, see this mask." And he would tell me, "Laolu, I don't see anything." So I would use ink, and I would trace out what I saw on the floor.
And then when my mom noticed, she got really upset.
(Laughter)
But that didn't stop me.
I switched from ink to chalk, because I got in trouble a lot with my teachers and my parents.
So I remember my mom said, "Laolu, we are Christians.
Why don't you draw like other people?
Why don't you draw landscapes or maybe you draw chairs or furniture, or maybe even draw Jesus?"
You know, I could paint the whole house if I had a chance, but when I grew up, I knew being an artist was not an option, so I wanted to be the person my parents wanted me to be, so I went to law school.
Of course, that's my dad there.
He was so proud that day.
And this was what my notebooks looked like in law school.
(Laughter)
Of course I would miss classes, and I would make up excuses why I wasn't going to class.
But when I started working at the Human Rights Commission as a human rights attorney, my mind was elsewhere.
I saw a very tough reality.
I worked with children who had to choose between getting an education and actually being forced into marriage.
I was so frustrated seeing all the injustice around me, and my only outlet was art, so I started painting.
This piece is called "Dreamscape." So when you zoom into this piece, you're going to see a girl child and the accidental birth, the fact that our future is controlled by where we are born.
Now, the next one you see a man and a man holding hands, a woman and a woman holding hands.
You see, in Nigeria, same-sex relationship is criminalized.
You can actually get 14 years for that.
With my art, I like to tell stories.
Through my art, I like to start a conversation.
So in this one, you see the map of Africa, you see the questions, you see crying, and there you see syringes plugged into Africa and the natural resources being drained out.
So I asked myself, where does it go?
Who benefits from all of this?
You see, with my art, the way I weave my art around the patterns, the masks, the stories, and the way I use my lines, it's all from the Yoruba culture.
So in 2013, I made a big gamble.
I quit my job and I moved to New York City to practice art full time.
Of course, my parents were like, "Oh, [it's just a phase.] He'll come back." But life as an artist in New York was not easy, because I was broke, no money, no gallery agents, no representation, so no gallery would show my work.
So I thought to myself, I need to survive.
So I started painting on clothes to make a living.
I started painting on shoes.
I started customizing things for people.
And then soon I realized the power, because people were so proud to wear their stories.
So I started painting on everything.
I painted on guitars, I started doing murals, anything I could find my hand on I painted, and everything became my canvas.
So one day, I was just going on my Instagram feed, and I saw this picture. It was Reign. She took a picture standing in front my art, and the moment I saw that photo, something happened in that moment.
I could actually see my artwork go into her and come out of her literally, and that's how I started painting on human bodies.
As a child I saw art on the marble floors, I saw art on walls, but now I see art on people's faces and people's bodies.
I remember my grandmother, and I realized that most of my creative instincts were actually based on my childhood memories and the art on my grandmother's skin.
Now I look at all the people I painted, and I think to myself, like, what would it look like if we all walked around like gods and goddesses from Yoruba mythology? And boom, that's how The Sacred Art of the Ori was born.
You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology means your soul, it means your essence, it means your instincts.
And I realized that only when you tap into your Ori, then you can actually move mountains.
So there's something so immediate about painting on human bodies.
It's like art in motion.
It's like a 3D experience.
So one day, I was just doing my regular work in Brooklyn, and I got an email that said, "Hi, I'm a big fan of your work.
Would you like to paint for my music video?
Signed, Beyoncé." Like, Beyoncé emailed me.
I was like, what?
(Laughter) I was like, what, how did she even know me?
I thought this can't be true. Of course I thought it was a scam. The Nigerian in me was like, nah.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But incredibly enough, it was real, it was true, and things happened really fast.
You see, Beyoncé wanted to pay homage to New Orleans, and my art reminded her of her creole origins.
So when "Lemonade" dropped, of course, boom, everything just went from zero to 100 real fast.
People featured me in magazines, interviews.
People stopped me in the street.
People knew my name, like -- And sometimes I had to step back and just chill, and, like, take everything in.
You know, as artists, we work so hard all our lives for our art to be recognized, and for this I feel blessed.
However, the attorney in me is still there, so I use my art to fight for what I believe in.
My Yoruba heritage is always there.
I'd like to share with you tonight some of my art in motion.
Please, welcome with me on stage.
(Music)
(Applause)
Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign.
These are the first two people I ever painted in my life, and I spent the past day painting on them.
Tonight, they represent my hopes and my fears.
Now, I put my fears on the back. I put my hopes in front.
What are my hopes?
I hope that people know that Africa is not just one huge, nameless continent that is all the same.
I also hope that people know that in Nigeria, we have over 350 ethnic groups and languages, and I am just one artist from one of them.
(Applause)
I also hope that you know that I hope I will be able to change the way people talk about African art on the continent and here, and I hope you know that African art is not just what you buy at Harlem markets in New York and that every piece of art you see has a story, and every artist has a name.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm Chetan Bhatt and when I give my name, I'm often asked, "Where are you from?" And I normally say London.
(Laughter)
But of course, I know what they're really asking, so I say something like, "Well, my grandparents and my mum were born in India, my dad and I were born in Kenya, and I was brought up in London.
And then they've got me mapped. "Ah, you're a Kenyan Asian.
I've worked with one of those. "
(Laughter)
And from my name they probably assume that I'm a Hindu.
And this sort of fixes me for them.
But what about the Christians and the Muslims and the atheists that I grew up with?
Or the socialists and the liberals, even the occasional Tory?
(Laughter)
Indeed, all kinds of women and men -- vegetable sellers, factory workers, cooks, car mechanics -- living in my working class area, in some profoundly important way, they are also a part of me and are here with me.
Maybe that's why I find it hard to respond to questions about identity and about origin.
And it's not just a sort of teenage refusal to be labeled.
It's about our own most identities, the ones that we put our hands up to, the ones that we cheer for, the ones that we fight for, the ones that we love or hate.
And it's about how we apprehend ourselves as well as others.
And it's about identities we just assume that we have without thinking too much about them.
But our responses to questions of identity and origin have substantial social and political importance.
We see the wars, the rages of identity going on all around us.
We see violent religious, national and ethnic disputes.
And often the conflict is based on old stories of identity and belonging and origins.
And these identities are based on myths, typically about ancient, primordial origins.
And these could be about Adam and Eve or about the supremacy of a caste or gender or about the vitality of a supposed race or about the past glories of an empire or civilization or about a piece of land that some imagined deity has gifted.
Now, people say that origin stories and identity myths make us feel secure.
What's wrong with that?
They give us a sense of belonging.
Identity is your cultural clothing, and it can make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. But does it really? Do we really need identity myths to feel safe?
Because I see religious, national, ethnic disputes as adding to human misery.
Can I dare you to refuse every origin myth that claims you?
What if we reject every single primordial origin myth and develop a deeper sense of personhood, one responsible to humanity as a whole rather than to a particular tribe, a radically different idea of humanity that exposes how origin myths mystify, disguise global power, rapacious exploitation, poverty, the worldwide oppression of women and girls, and of course massive, accelerating inequalities?
Now, origin myths are closely linked to tradition, and the word tradition points to something old and permanent, almost natural, and people assume tradition is just history, simply the past condensed into a nice story.
But let's not confuse tradition with history.
The two are often in severe conflict.
Origin stories are usually recently created fictions of ancient belonging, and they're absurd given the complexity of humanity and our vastly interconnected, even if very unequal world.
And today we see claims to tradition that claim to be ancient changing rapidly in front of our eyes.
I was brought up in the 1970s near Wembley with Asian, English, Caribbean, Irish families living in our street, and the neo-Nazi National Front was massive then with regular marches and attacks on us and a permanent threat and often a frequent reality of violence against us on the streets, in our homes, typically by neo-Nazis and other racists.
And I remember during a general election a leaflet came through our letter box with a picture of the National Front candidate for our area.
And the picture was of our next-door neighbor.
He threatened to shoot me once when I played in the garden as a kid, and many weekends, shaven-headed National Front activists arrived at his house and emerged with scores of placards screaming that they wanted us to go back home.
But today he's one of my mum's best mates.
He's a very lovely, gentle and kind man, and at some point in his political journey out of fascism he embraced a broader idea of humanity.
There was a Hindu family that we got to know well -- and you have to understand that life in our street was a little bit like the setting for an Asian soap opera.
Everyone knew everyone else's business, even if they didn't want it to be known by anyone at all.
You really had no choice in this matter.
But in this family, there was a quiet little boy who went to the same school as I did, and after I left school, I didn't hear much more about him, except that he'd gone off to India.
Now around 2000, I remember seeing this short book.
The book was unusual because it was written by a British supporter of Al Qaeda, and in it the author calls for attacks in Britain.
This is in 1999, so 9 / 11 and the invasion of Iraq was still in the future, and he helped scout New York bombing targets.
He taught others how to make a dirty bomb to use on the London Underground, and he plotted a massive bombing campaign in London's shopping areas.
He's a very high-risk security prisoner in the UK and one of the most important Al Qaeda figures to be arrested in Britain.
The author of that book was the very same quiet little boy who went to my school.
So a Hindu boy from Britain became an Al Qaeda fighter and a most-wanted international terrorist, and he rejected what people would call his Hindu or Indian or British identity, and he became someone else.
He refused to be who he was.
He recreated himself, and this kind of journey is very common for young men and women who become involved in Al Qaeda or Islamic State or other transnational armed groups.
Al Qaeda's media spokesman is a white American from a Jewish and Catholic mixed background, and neither he nor the boy from my school were from Muslim backgrounds.
There's no point in asking them where are they from.
A more important question is where they're going.
And I would also put it to you that exactly the same journey occurs for those young men and women who were brought up in Muslim family backgrounds.
Most of those who join Al Qaeda and other Salafi jihadi groups from Europe, Asia, North America, even in many cases the Middle East are those who have comprehensively rejected their backgrounds to become, in essence, new people.
They spend an enormous amount of time attacking their parents' backgrounds as profane, impure, blasphemous, the wrong type of Islam, and their vision instead is a fantastical view of cosmic apocalypse.
It's a born again vision.
Discard your past, your society, your family and friends since they're all impure.
Instead, become someone else, your true self, your authentic self.
Now, this isn't about a return to the past. It's about using a forgery of the past to envision an appalling future which begins today at year zero.
This is why over 80 percent of the victims of Al Qaeda and Islamic State are people from Muslim backgrounds.
The first act by Salafi jihadi groups when they take over an area is to destroy existing Muslim institutions including mosques, shrines, preachers, practices.
Their main purpose is to control and punish people internally, to dictate the spaces that women may go, their clothing, family relations, beliefs, even the minute detail of how one prays.
And you get the impression in the news that they are after us in the West, but they are actually mainly after people from other Muslim backgrounds.
In their view, no other Muslim can ever be pure enough, so ordinary beliefs and practices that have existed for centuries are attacked as impure by teenagers from Birmingham or London who know nothing about the histories that they so joyously obliterate.
Now here, their claim to tradition is at war with history, but they're nevertheless very certain about their purity and about the impurity of others.
Purity, certainty, the return to authentic tradition, the quest for these can lead to lethal visions of perfect societies and perfected people.
This is what the main Hindu fundamentalist organization in India looks like today at its mass rally.
Maybe it reminds you of the 1930s in Italy or Germany, and the movement's roots are indeed in fascism.
It was a member of the same Hindu fundamentalist movement who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi.
Hindu fundamentalists today view this murderer as a national hero, and they want to put up statues of him throughout India.
They've been involved for decades in large-scale mass violence against minorities.
They ban books, art, films.
They attack romantic couples on Valentine's Day, Christians on Christmas Day.
They don't like others talking critically about what they see as their ancient culture or using its images or caricaturing it or drawing cartoons about it.
But the people making the strongest possible claims about ancient, timeless Hindu religion are dressed in brown shorts and white shirts while claiming, oddly, to be the original Aryan race, just like the violent Salafi jihadis who make their claims about their primordial religion while dressed in black military uniforms and wearing balaclavas.
These people are manufacturing pure, pristine identities of conviction and of certainty.
Fundamentalists see religion and culture as their sole property, a property.
But religions and cultures are processes.
They're not things. They're impermanent. They're messy. They're impure. Look at any religion and you'll see disputes and arguments going all the way down.
Any criticism of religion in any form has to therefore be part of the expansive sense of humanity we should aspire to.
I respect your right to have and to express your religion or your culture or your opinion, but I don't necessarily have to respect the content.
I might like some of it. I might like how an old church looks, for example, but this isn't the same thing.
Similarly, I have a human right to say something that you may find offensive, but you do not have a human right not to be offended.
In a genuine democracy, we're constantly offended since people express different views all the time.
They also change their views, so their views are impermanent.
You cannot fix someone's political views based on their religious or national or cultural background.
Now, these points about religious purity also apply to nationalism and to racism.
I'm always puzzled to have pride in your national or ethnic identity, pride in the accident of birth from a warm and cozy womb, belief in your superiority because of the accident of birth.
These people have very firm ideas about what belongs and what doesn't belong inside the cozy national cultures that they imagine.
And I'm going to caricature a bit here, but only a little bit.
I want you to imagine the supporter of some Little Englander or British nationalist political party, and he's sitting at home and he's screaming about foreigners invading his country while watching Fox News, an American cable channel owned by an Australian on his South Korean television set which was bought by his Spanish credit card which is paid off monthly by his high-street British bank which has its headquarters in Hong Kong.
He supports a British football team owned by a Russian.
His favorite brand of fish and chips is owned by a Swedish venture capitalist firm.
The church he sometimes goes to has its creed decided in meetings in Ghana.
His Union Jack underpants were made in India.
(Laughter)
And --
(Applause)
Thank you.
And they're laundered regularly by a very nice Polish lady.
(Laughter)
There is no pure ethnicity, national culture, and the ethical choices we have today are far wider than being forced to choose between racist right and religious right visions, dismal visions of culture.
Now, culture isn't just about language, food, clothing and music, but gender relations, ancient monuments, a heritage of sacred texts.
But culture can also be what has been decided to be culture by those who have a political stake in pounding culture into the shape of a prison.
Big political identity claims are elite bids for power.
They're not answers to social or economic or political injustices.
They often obscure them.
And what about the large number of people across the globe who can't point to a monument from their past, who don't possess a sacred written text, who can't hark back to the past glories of a civilization or empire?
Are these people less a part of humanity?
What about you, now, listening to this?
What about you and your identity, because you stitch your experiences and your thoughts into a continuous person moving forward in time.
And this is what you are when you say, "I," "am," or "me." But this also includes all of your hopes and dreams, all of the you's that could have been, and it includes all the other people and the things that are in the biography of who you are.
They, the others, are also a part of you, moving forward with you.
Your authentic self, if such a thing exists, is a complex, messy and uncertain self, and that is a very good thing.
Why not value those impurities and uncertainties?
Maybe clinging to pure identities is a sign of immaturity, and ethnic, nationalist and religious traditions are bad for you.
Why not be skeptical about every primordial origin claim made on your behalf?
Why not reject the identity myths that call on you to belong, that politicians and community leaders, so-called community leaders, place on you?
If we don't need origin stories and fixed identities, we can challenge ourselves to think creatively about each other and our future.
And here culture always takes care of itself.
I'm not worried about culture.
Cultures are creative, dynamic processes, not imposed laws and boundaries.
This is Abu al-Walid Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd, a very senior Muslim judge and thinker in Cordoba in the 12th century, and his writings were considered deeply blasphemous, heretical and evil.
Long after he died, followers of his work were ruthlessly hunted down, banished and killed over several centuries by the most powerful religious institution of the medieval period.
That institution was the Roman Catholic Church. Why? Because ibn Rushd said that something true in religion may conflict with something that your reason finds to be true on earth, but the latter is still true.
There are two distinct worlds of truth, one based on our reason and evidence, and one that is divine, and the state, political power, social law are in the realm of reason.
Religious life is a different realm.
They should be kept separated.
Social and political life should be governed by our reason, not by religion.
And you can see why the church was upset by his writings, as indeed were some Muslims during his lifetime, because he gives us a strong statement of secularism of a kind which is normal in Europe today.
Now, history plays many tricks on us.
It undermines our fixed truths and what we believe to be our culture and their culture.
Ibn Rushd, someone who happens to be a Muslim, is considered one of the key influences in the introduction and spread of secularism in Europe.
So against religious, nationalist and racial purists of all kinds, can you make his story a part of your own, not because he happened to be a Muslim, not because he happened to be an Arab, but because he was a human being with some very good ideas that shook his world and ours.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When someone mentions Cuba, what do you think about?
Classic, classic cars? Perhaps good cigars? Maybe you think of a famous baseball player.
What about when somebody mentions North Korea?
You think about those missile tests, maybe their notorious leader or his good friend, Dennis Rodman.
(Laughter)
One thing that likely doesn't come to mind is a vision of a country, an open economy, whose citizens have access to a wide range of affordable consumer products.
I'm not here to argue how these countries got to where they are today.
I simply want to use them as an example of countries and citizens who have been affected, negatively affected, by a trade policy that restricts imports and protects local industries.
Recently we've heard a number of countries talk about restricting imports and protecting their local, domestic industries.
Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite, but what it really is is protectionism.
We heard a lot about this during the 2016 presidential election.
We heard about it during the Brexit debates and most recently during the French elections.
In fact, it's been a really important topic being talked about around the world, and many aspiring political leaders are running on platforms positioning protectionism as a good thing.
Now, I could see why they think protectionism is good, because sometimes it seems like trade is unfair.
Some have blamed trade for some of the problems we've been having here at home in the US.
For years we've been hearing about the loss of high-paying US manufacturing jobs.
Many think that manufacturing is declining in the US because companies are moving their operations offshore to markets with lower-cost labor like China, Mexico and Vietnam.
They also think trade agreements sometimes are unfair, like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because these trade agreements allow companies to reimport those cheaply produced goods back into the US and other countries from where the jobs were taken.
So it kind of feels like the exporters win and the importers lose.
Now, the reality is output in the manufacturing sector in the US is actually growing, but we are losing jobs.
We're losing lots of them.
In fact, from 2000 to 2010, 5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.
But they're not being lost for the reasons you might think.
Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio didn't lose his jobs at the factory to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico. No. Mike lost his job to a machine.
87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs have been eliminated because we've made improvements in our own productivity through automation.
So that means that one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs was due to offshoring.
No. Now, this is not just a US phenomenon. In fact, automation is spreading to every production line in every country around the world.
But look, I get it: if you just lost your job and then you read in the newspaper that your old company just struck up a deal with China, it's easy to think you were just replaced in a one-for-one deal.
When I hear stories like this, I think that what people picture is that trade happens between only two countries.
Manufacturers in one country produce products and they export them to consumers in other countries, and it feels like the manufacturing countries win and the importing countries lose.
Well, reality's a little bit different.
I'm a supply chain professional, and I live and work in Mexico.
And I work in the middle of a highly connected network of manufacturers all collaborating from around the world to produce many of the products we use today.
What I see from my front-row seat in Mexico City actually looks more like this.
And this is a more accurate depiction of what trade really looks like.
I've had the pleasure of being able to see how many different products are manufactured, from golf clubs to laptop computers to internet servers, automobiles and even airplanes.
And believe me, none of it happens in a straight line. Let me give you an example.
A few months ago, I was touring the manufacturing plant of a multinational aerospace company in Querétaro, Mexico, and the VP of logistics points out a completed tail assembly.
It turns out the tail assemblies are assembled from panels that are manufactured in France, and they're assembled in Mexico using components imported from the US.
When those tail assemblies are done, they're exported via truck to Canada to their primary assembly plant where they come together with thousands of other parts, like the wings and the seats and the little shades over the little windows, all coming in to become a part of a new airplane. Think about it. These new airplanes, before they even take their first flight, they have more stamps in their passports than Angelina Jolie.
Now, this approach to processing goes on all around the world to manufacture many of the products we use every day, from skin cream to airplanes.
When you go home tonight, take a look in your house.
You might be surprised to find a label that looks like this one: "Manufactured in the USA from US and foreign parts."
Economist Michael Porter described what's going on here best.
Many decades ago, he said that it's most beneficial for a country to focus on producing the products it can produce most efficiently and trading for the rest.
So what he's talking about here is shared production, and efficiency is the name of the game.
You've probably seen an example of this at home or at work.
Let's take a look at an example. Think about how your house was built or your kitchen renovated.
Typically, there's a general contractor who is responsible for coordinating the efforts of all the different contractors: an architect to draw the plans, an earth-moving company to dig the foundation, a plumber, a carpenter and so on. So why doesn't the general contractor pick just one company to do all the work, like, say, the architect?
Because this is silly.
The general contractor selects experts because it takes years to learn and master how to do each of the tasks it takes to build a house or renovate a kitchen, some of them requiring special training.
Think about it. Would you want your architect to install your toilet? Of course not.
So let's apply this process to the corporate world.
Companies today focus on manufacturing what they produce best and most efficiently, and they trade for everything else.
So this means they rely on a global, interconnected, interdependent network of manufacturers to produce these products.
In fact, that network is so interconnected it's almost impossible to dismantle and produce products in just one country.
Let's take a look at the interconnected web we saw a few moments ago, and let's focus on just one strand between the US and Mexico.
The Wilson Institute says that shared production represents 40 percent of the half a trillion dollars in trade between the US and Mexico.
That's about 200 billion dollars, or the same as the GDP for Portugal.
So let's just imagine that the US decides to impose a 20 percent border tax on all imports from Mexico. OK, fine. But do you think Mexico is just going to stand by and let that happen? No. No way. So in retaliation, they impose a similar tax on all goods being imported from the US, and a little game of tit-for-tat ensues, and 20 percent -- just imagine that 20 percent duties are added to every good, product, product component crossing back and forth across the border, and you could be looking at more than a 40 percent increase in duties, or 80 billion dollars.
Now, don't kid yourself, these costs are going to be passed along to you and to me.
Now, let's think about what impact that might have on some of the products, or the prices of the products, that we buy every day.
So if a 30 percent increase in duties were actually passed along, we would be looking at some pretty important increases in prices.
A Lincoln MKZ would go from 37,000 dollars to 48,000.
And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV would go from 898 dollars to 1,167 dollars.
And the price of a 16-ounce jar of CVS skin moisturizer would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.
between the US and Mexico. Now, remember, this is only looking at one strand of the production chain so multiply this out across all of the strands.
The impact could be considerable.
Now, just think about this: even if we were able to dismantle this network and produce products in just one country, which by the way is easier said than done, we would still only be saving or protecting one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.
That's right, because remember, most of those jobs, 87 percent, were lost due to improvements in our own productivity.
And unfortunately, those jobs, they're gone for good.
So the real question is, does it make sense for us to drive up prices to the point where many of us can't afford the basic goods we use every day for the purpose of saving a job that might be eliminated in a couple of years anyway?
The reality is that shared production allows us to manufacture higher quality products at lower costs.
It's that simple.
It allows us to get more out of the limited resources and expertise we have and at the same time benefit from lower prices.
It's really important to remember that for shared production to be effective, it relies on efficient cross-border movement of raw materials, components and finished products.
So remember this: the next time you're hearing somebody try to sell you on the idea that protectionism is a good deal, it's just not.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Where does the end begin? Well, for me, it all began with this little fellow.
This adorable organism -- well, I think it's adorable -- is called Tetrahymena and it's a single-celled creature.
It's also been known as pond scum.
So that's right, my career started with pond scum.
Now, it was no surprise I became a scientist.
Growing up far away from here, as a little girl I was deadly curious about everything alive.
I used to pick up lethally poisonous stinging jellyfish and sing to them.
And so starting my career, I was deadly curious about fundamental mysteries of the most basic building blocks of life, and I was fortunate to live in a society where that curiosity was valued.
Now, for me, this little pond scum critter Tetrahymena was a great way to study the fundamental mystery I was most curious about: those bundles of DNA in our cells called chromosomes.
And it was because I was curious about the very ends of chromosomes, known as telomeres.
Now, when I started my quest, all we knew was that they helped protect the ends of chromosomes.
It was important when cells divide.
It was really important, but I wanted to find out what telomeres consisted of, and for that, I needed a lot of them.
And it so happens that cute little Tetrahymena has a lot of short linear chromosomes, around 20,000, so lots of telomeres.
And I discovered that telomeres consisted of special segments of noncoding DNA right at the very ends of chromosomes.
But here's a problem.
Now, we all start life as a single cell.
It multiples to two. Two becomes four. Four becomes eight, and on and on to form the 200 million billion cells that make up our adult body.
And some of those cells have to divide thousands of times.
In fact, even as I stand here before you, all throughout my body, cells are furiously replenishing to, well, keep me standing here before you.
So every time a cell divides, all of its DNA has to be copied, all of the coding DNA inside of those chromosomes, because that carries the vital operating instructions that keep our cells in good working order, so my heart cells can keep a steady beat, which I assure you they're not doing right now, and my immune cells can fight off bacteria and viruses, and our brain cells can save the memory of our first kiss and keep on learning throughout life.
But there is a glitch in the way DNA is copied.
It is just one of those facts of life.
Every time the cell divides and the DNA is copied, some of that DNA from the ends gets worn down and shortened, some of that telomere DNA.
And think about it like the protective caps at the ends of your shoelace.
And those keep the shoelace, or the chromosome, from fraying, and when that tip gets too short, it falls off, and that worn down telomere sends a signal to the cells. "The DNA is no longer being protected." It sends a signal. Time to die. So, end of story.
Well, sorry, not so fast.
It can't be the end of the story, because life hasn't died off the face of the earth.
So I was curious: if such wear and tear is inevitable, how on earth does Mother Nature make sure we can keep our chromosomes intact?
Now, remember that little pond scum critter Tetrahymena?
The craziest thing was, Tetrahymena cells never got old and died.
Their telomeres weren't shortening as time marched on.
Sometimes they even got longer.
Something else was at work, and believe me, that something was not in any textbook.
So working in my lab with my extraordinary student Carol Greider -- and Carol and I shared the Nobel Prize for this work -- we began running experiments and we discovered cells do have something else.
It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme that could replenish, make longer, telomeres, and we named it telomerase.
And when we removed our pond scum's telomerase, their telomeres ran down and they died.
So it was thanks to their plentiful telomerase that our pond scum critters never got old.
OK, now, that's an incredibly hopeful message for us humans to be receiving from pond scum, because it turns out that as we humans age, our telomeres do shorten, and remarkably, that shortening is aging us.
Generally speaking, the longer your telomeres, the better off you are.
It's the overshortening of telomeres that leads us to feel and see signs of aging.
My skin cells start to die and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.
Hair pigment cells die. You start to see gray.
Immune system cells die.
You increase your risks of getting sick. In fact, the cumulative research from the last 20 years has made clear that telomere attrition is contributing to our risks of getting cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes, the very conditions many of us die of.
And so we have to think about this. What is going on? This attrition, we look and we feel older, yeah.
Our telomeres are losing the war of attrition faster.
And those of us who feel youthful longer, it turns out our telomeres are staying longer for longer periods of time, extending our feelings of youthfulness and reducing the risks of all we most dread as the birthdays go by.
OK, seems like a no-brainer.
Now, if my telomeres are connected to how quickly I'm going to feel and get old, if my telomeres can be renewed by my telomerase, then all I have to do to reverse the signs and symptoms of aging is figure out where to buy that Costco-sized bottle of grade A organic fair trade telomerase, right? Great! Problem solved.
(Applause)
Not so fast, I'm sorry.
Alas, that's not the case. OK. And why? It's because human genetics has taught us that when it comes to our telomerase, we humans live on a knife edge.
OK, simply put, yes, nudging up telomerase does decrease the risks of some diseases, but it also increases the risks of certain and rather nasty cancers.
So even if you could buy that Costco-sized bottle of telomerase, and there are many websites marketing such dubious products, the problem is you could nudge up your risks of cancers.
And we don't want that.
Now, don't worry, and because, while I think it's kind of funny that right now, you know, many of us may be thinking, well, I'd rather be like pond scum.
(Laughter)
There is something for us humans in the story of telomeres and their maintenance.
But I want to get one thing clear.
It isn't about enormously extending human lifespan or immortality.
It's about health span.
Now, health span is the number of years of your life when you're free of disease, you're healthy, you're productive, you're zestfully enjoying life.
Disease span, the opposite of health span, is the time of your life spent feeling old and sick and dying.
OK, So the real question becomes, OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase, do I have control over my telomeres' length and hence my well-being, my health, without those downsides of cancer risks?
So, it's the year 2000.
Now, I've been minutely scrutinizing little teeny tiny telomeres very happily for many years, when into my lab walks a psychologist named Elissa Epel.
Now, Elissa's expertise is in the effects of severe, chronic psychological stress on our mind's and our body's health.
And there she was standing in my lab, which ironically overlooked the entrance to a mortuary, and --
(Laughter)
And she had a life-and-death question for me. "What happens to telomeres in people who are chronically stressed?" she asked me.
You see, she'd been studying caregivers, and specifically mothers of children with a chronic condition, be it gut disorder, be it autism, you name it -- a group obviously under enormous and prolonged psychological stress.
I have to say, her question changed me profoundly.
See, all this time I had been thinking of telomeres as those miniscule molecular structures that they are, and the genes that control telomeres.
And when Elissa asked me about studying caregivers, I suddenly saw telomeres in a whole new light.
I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes into the lives of the real people we were studying.
And I'm a mom myself, and at that moment, I was struck by the image of these women dealing with a child with a condition very difficult to deal with, often without help.
And such women, simply, often look worn down.
So was it possible their telomeres were worn down as well?
So our collective curiosity went into overdrive.
Elissa selected for our first study a group of such caregiving mothers, and we wanted to ask: What's the length of their telomeres compared with the number of years that they have been caregiving for their child with a chronic condition?
So four years go by and the day comes when all the results are in, and Elissa looked down at our first scatterplot and literally gasped, because there was a pattern to the data, and it was the exact gradient that we most feared might exist.
It was right there on the page.
The longer, the more years that is, the mother had been in this caregiving situation, no matter her age, the shorter were her telomeres.
And the more she perceived her situation as being more stressful, the lower was her telomerase and the shorter were her telomeres.
So we had discovered something unheard of: the more chronic stress you are under, the shorter your telomeres, meaning the more likely you were to fall victim to an early disease span and perhaps untimely death.
Our findings meant that people's life events and the way we respond to these events can change how you maintain your telomeres.
So telomere length wasn't just a matter of age counted in years.
Elissa's question to me, back when she first came to my lab, indeed had been a life-and-death question.
Now, luckily, hidden in that data there was hope.
We noticed that some mothers, despite having been carefully caring for their children for many years, had been able to maintain their telomeres.
So studying these women closely revealed that they were resilient to stress.
Somehow they were able to experience their circumstances not as a threat day in and day out but as a challenge, and this has led to a very important insight for all of us: we have control over the way we age all the way down into our cells.
OK, now our initial curiosity became infectious.
Thousands of scientists from different fields added their expertise to telomere research, and the findings have poured in.
It's up to over 10,000 scientific papers and counting.
So several studies rapidly confirmed our initial finding that yes, chronic stress is bad for telomeres.
And now many are revealing that we have more control over this particular aging process than any of us could ever have imagined.
A few examples: a study from the University of California, Los Angeles of people who are caring for a relative with dementia, long-term, and looked at their caregiver's telomere maintenance capacity and found that it was improved by them practicing a form of meditation for as little as 12 minutes a day for two months. Attitude matters. If you're habitually a negative thinker, you typically see a stressful situation with a threat stress response, meaning if your boss wants to see you, you automatically think, "I'm about to be fired," and your blood vessels constrict, and your level of the stress hormone cortisol creeps up, and then it stays up, and over time, that persistently high level of the cortisol actually damps down your telomerase.
Not good for your telomeres.
On the other hand, if you typically see something stressful as a challenge to be tackled, then blood flows to your heart and to your brain, and you experience a brief but energizing spike of cortisol.
And thanks to that habitual "bring it on" attitude, your telomeres do just fine.
So... What is all of this telling us?
Your telomeres do just fine.
You really do have power to change what is happening to your own telomeres.
But our curiosity just got more and more intense, because we started to wonder, what about factors outside our own skin?
Could they impact our telomere maintenance as well?
You know, we humans are intensely social beings.
Was it even possible that our telomeres were social as well?
And the results have been startling.
As early as childhood, emotional neglect, exposure to violence, bullying and racism all impact your telomeres, and the effects are long-term.
Can you imagine the impact on children of living years in a war zone?
People who can't trust their neighbors and who don't feel safe in their neighborhoods consistently have shorter telomeres.
So your home address matters for telomeres as well.
On the flip side, tight-knit communities, being in a marriage long-term, and lifelong friendships, even, all improve telomere maintenance.
So what is all this telling us?
It's telling us that I have the power to impact my own telomeres, and I also have the power to impact yours.
Telomere science has told us just how interconnected we all are.
But I'm still curious. I do wonder what legacy all of us will leave for the next generation?
Will we invest in the next young woman or man peering through a microscope at the next little critter, the next bit of pond scum, curious about a question we don't even know today is a question?
It could be a great question that could impact all the world.
And maybe, maybe you're curious about you.
Now that you know how to protect your telomeres, are you curious what are you going to do with all those decades of brimming good health?
And now that you know you could impact the telomeres of others, are you curious how will you make a difference?
And now that you know the power of curiosity to change the world, how will you make sure that the world invests in curiosity for the sake of the generations that will come after us?
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is a picture of a sunset on Mars taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.
Mars is a very cold planet, flooded with high levels of UV radiation and extremely dry.
In fact, Mars is considered to be too dry for life as we know it.
I'm an astrobiologist. I try to understand the origin of life on Earth and the possibilities of finding life elsewhere in the universe.
People sometimes ask me, how can you be an astrobiologist if you don't have your own spaceship?
Well, what I do is that I study life in those environments on Earth that most closely resemble other interesting places in the universe.
All life on Earth requires water, so in my case I focus on the intimate relationship between water and life in order to understand if we could find life in a planet as dry as Mars.
But since I do not have the 2.5 billion dollars to send my own robot to Mars, I study the most Martian place on Earth, the Atacama Desert.
Located in northern Chile, it is the oldest and driest desert on Earth.
To give you an idea of how dry it is, consider here in Vancouver it rains over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.
In the Atacama, there are places with no reported rains in the last 400 years.
How do I know this? Well, because I was born and raised in the Atacama --
(Laughter)
So I had a unique advantage when I started studying this desert.
So let me tell you guys a few fantastic examples he has found on how life has adapted to live with almost no water at all.
One of my first findings was in the entrance of a cave facing the Pacific Ocean.
In this place, we reported a new type of microalgae that grew only on top of the spiderwebs that covered the cave entrance.
Have you ever seen a spiderweb early in the morning?
It's covered with dew, so this microalgae learned that in order to carry photosynthesis in the coast of the driest desert on Earth, they could use the spiderwebs.
So here they may access the water from the fogs that regularly cover these areas in the morning.
In another cave, we found a different type of microalgae.
This one is able to use ocean mist as a source of water, and strikingly lives in the very bottom of a cave, so it has adapted to live with less than 0.1 percent of the amount of light that regular plants need.
These type of findings suggest to me that on Mars, we may find even photosynthetic life inside caves.
And by the way, that's me.
(Laughter)
Now, for almost 15 years this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA, was thought to be the driest place of this desert, but I knew that it was not. How? You already know the answer.
Because I was born and raised in this desert.
So I remembered that I usually see fogs in Yungay, so after setting sensors in a number of places, where I remember never seeing fogs or clouds, I reported four other sites much drier than Yungay, with this one, María Elena South, being the truly driest place on Earth, as dry as Mars, and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride from the small mining town where I was born.
Now, in this search, we were trying to actually find the dry limit for life on Earth, a place so dry that nothing was able to survive in it.
But even here, well hidden underground, we found a number of different microorganisms, which suggested to me that similarly dry places, like Mars, may be inhabited.
We even have some preliminary evidences that these microorganisms may still be active in the desiccated state, like walking mummies all around us, and that they may be using UV radiation as a source of energy.
If confirmed, this would have a huge impact on our definition of life, on how we look for life elsewhere in the universe.
Due to its clear skies, by 2020, 60 percent of the biggest telescopes on Earth will be located in the Atacama, and while everyone else will be looking among the stars to answer the question, "Are we alone?" I will be looking down to the ground searching for this same answer in my own backyard.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In my early days as a graduate student, I went on a snorkeling trip off the coast of the Bahamas.
I'd actually never swum in the ocean before, so it was a bit terrifying.
What I remember the most is, as I put my head in the water and I was trying really hard to breathe through the snorkel, this huge group of striped yellow and black fish came straight at me ... and I just froze.
And then, as if it had suddenly changed its mind, came towards me and then swerved to the right and went right around me.
It was absolutely mesmerizing.
Maybe many of you have had this experience.
Of course, there's the color and the beauty of it, but there was also just the sheer oneness of it, as if it wasn't hundreds of fish but a single entity with a single collective mind that was making decisions.
When I look back, I think that experience really ended up determining what I've worked on for most of my career.
I'm a computer scientist, and the field that I work in is artificial intelligence.
And a key theme in AI is being able to understand intelligence by creating our own computational systems that display intelligence the way we see it in nature.
Now, most popular views of AI, of course, come from science fiction and the movies, and I'm personally a big Star Wars fan.
But that tends to be a very human-centric view of intelligence.
When you think of a fish school, or when I think of a flock of starlings, that feels like a really different kind of intelligence.
For starters, any one fish is just so tiny compared to the sheer size of the collective, so it seems that any one individual would have a really limited and myopic view of what's going on, and intelligence isn't really about the individual but somehow a property of the group itself.
Secondly, and the thing that I still find most remarkable, is that we know that there are no leaders supervising this fish school.
Instead, this incredible collective mind behavior is emerging purely from the interactions of one fish and another.
Somehow, there are these interactions or rules of engagement between neighboring fish that make it all work out.
So the question for AI then becomes, what are those rules of engagement that lead to this kind of intelligence, and of course, can we create our own?
And that's the primary thing that I work on with my team in my lab.
We work on it through theory, looking at abstract rule systems and thinking about the mathematics behind it.
We also do it through biology, working closely with experimentalists.
But mostly, we do it through robotics, where we try to create our own collective systems that can do the kinds of things that we see in nature, or at least try to.
One of our first robotic quests along this line was to create our very own colony of a thousand robots.
So very simple robots, but they could be programmed to exhibit collective intelligence, and that's what we were able to do.
So this is what a single robot looks like.
It's quite small, about the size of a quarter, and you can program how it moves, but it can also wirelessly communicate with other robots, and it can measure distances from them.
And so now we can start to program exactly an interaction, a rule of engagement between neighbors.
And once we have this system, we can start to program many different kinds of rules of engagement that you would see in nature.
So for example, spontaneous synchronization, how audiences are clapping and suddenly start all clapping together, the fireflies flashing together.
We can program rules for pattern formation, how cells in a tissue determine what role they're going to take on and set the patterns of our bodies.
We can program rules for migration, and in this way, we're really learning from nature's rules.
But we can also take it a step further.
We can actually take these rules that we've learned from nature and combine them and create entirely new collective behaviors of our very own.
So for example, imagine that you had two different kinds of rules.
So your first rule is a motion rule where a moving robot can move around other stationary robots.
And your second rule is a pattern rule where a robot takes on a color based on its two nearest neighbors.
So if I start with a blob of robots in a little pattern seed, it turns out that these two rules are sufficient for the group to be able to self-assemble a simple line pattern.
And if I have more complicated pattern rules, and I design error correction rules, we can actually create really, really complicated self assemblies, and here's what that looks like.
So here, you're going to see a thousand robots that are working together to self-assemble the letter K. The K is on its side.
And the important thing is that no one is in charge.
So any single robot is only talking to a small number of robots nearby it, and it's using its motion rule to move around the half-built structure just looking for a place to fit in based on its pattern rules.
And even though no robot is doing anything perfectly, the rules are such that we can get the collective to do its goal robustly together.
And the illusion becomes almost so perfect, you know -- you just start to not even notice that they're individual robots at all, and it becomes a single entity, kind of like the school of fish.
So these are robots and rules in two dimensions, but we can also think about robots and rules in three dimensions.
So what if we could create robots that could build together?
And here, we can take inspiration from social insects.
So if you think about mound-building termites or you think about army ants, they create incredible, complex nest structures out of mud and even out of their own bodies.
And like the system I showed you before, these insects actually also have pattern rules that help them determine what to build, but the pattern can be made out of other insects, or it could be made out of mud.
And we can use that same idea to create rules for robots.
So here, you're going to see some simulated robots.
So the simulated robot has a motion rule, which is how it traverses through the structure, looking for a place to fit in, and it has pattern rules where it looks at groups of blocks to decide whether to place a block.
And with the right motion rules and the right pattern rules, we can actually get the robots to build whatever we want.
And of course, everybody wants their own tower.
(Laughter)
So once we have these rules, we can start to create the robot bodies that go with these rules.
So here, you see a robot that can climb over blocks, but it can also lift and move these blocks and it can start to edit the very structure that it's on.
But with these rules, this is really only one kind of robot body that you could imagine.
You could imagine many different kinds of robot bodies.
So if you think about robots that maybe could move sandbags and could help build levees, or we could think of robots that built out of soft materials and worked together to shore up a collapsed building -- so just the same kind of rules in different kinds of bodies.
Or if, like my group, you are completely obsessed with army ants, then maybe one day we can make robots that can climb over literally anything including other members of their tribe, and self-assemble things out of their own bodies.
Once you understand the rules, just many different kinds of robot visions become possible.
And coming back to the snorkeling trip, we actually understand a great deal about the rules that fish schools use.
So if we can invent the bodies to go with that, then maybe there is a future where I and my group will get to snorkel with a fish school of our own creation.
Each of these systems that I showed you brings us closer to having the mathematical and the conceptual tools to create our own versions of collective power, and this can enable many different kinds of future applications, whether you think about robots that build flood barriers or you think about robotic bee colonies that could pollinate crops or underwater schools of robots that monitor coral reefs, or if we reach for the stars and we thinking about programming constellations of satellites.
In each of these systems, being able to understand how to design the rules of engagement and being able to create good collective behavior becomes a key to realizing these visions.
So, so far I've talked about rules for insects and for fish and for robots, but what about the rules that apply to our own human collective?
And the last thought that I'd like to leave you with is that science is of course itself an incredible manifestation of collective intelligence, but unlike the beautiful fish schools that I study, I feel we still have a much longer evolutionary path to walk.
So in addition to working on improving the science of robot collectives, I also work on creating robots and thinking about rules that will improve our own scientific collective.
There's this saying that I love: who does science determines what science gets done.
Imagine a society where we had rules of engagement where every child grew up believing that they could stand here and be a technologist of the future, or where every adult believed that they had the ability not just to understand but to change how science and technology impacts their everyday lives.
What would that society look like?
I believe that we can do that.
I believe that we can choose our rules, and we engineer not just robots but we can engineer our own human collective, and if we do and when we do, it will be beautiful.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Back home, my friends call me nicknames, such as "The Giant Clam Girl," "Clam Queen," or, "The Mother of Clams."
(Laughter)
This is because every time I see them, I talk nonstop about giant clams all day, every day.
Giant clams are these massive and colorful shelled marine animals, the largest of its kind. Just look at this shell. The biggest recorded individual was four-and-a-half-feet long and weighed about 550 pounds.
That is almost as heavy as three baby elephants.
South Pacific legends once described giant clams as man-eaters that would lie in wait on the seabed to trap unsuspecting divers.
A story goes that a diver had lost his legs while trying to retrieve a pearl from a giant clam.
I thought, "Really?" So out of curiosity, I did an experiment using myself as bait.
(Laughter)
I carefully placed my hand into the clam's mouth and waited.
Hmm ... I still have my hand.
It seems that these gentle giants would rather retreat and protect their fleshy bodies than feed on me.
So much for those killer clam myths!
Unfortunately, the reality is, we are the giant clams' biggest threat.
Considered a delicacy throughout the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans, giant clams have been traditionally fished as seafood.
Fishermen are particularly interested in their adductor muscles, which are organs that hold the two shells together like a hinge.
Just for their muscles, giant clams were almost hunted to extinction between the 1960s and 1980s.
Clamshells are also popular in the ornamental trade as jewelry and for display.
In the South China Sea, fishermen went out of their way to collect fossilized clamshells by digging through large areas of coral reefs.
These were later carved and sold as so-called "ivory handicrafts" in China.
Giant clams, dead or alive, are not safe from us.
It's a "clamity!"
(Laughter)
(Applause)
With the spotlight on more charism atic marine animals such as the whales and coral reefs, it is easy to forget that other marine life needs our help, too.
My fascination with giant clams got me started on conservation research to fill in the knowledge gaps on their ecology and behavior.
One of the discoveries that we made was that giant clams could walk across the seafloor.
Yes, you heard me right: they can walk.
To find out, we placed numerous baby clams on a grid.
Now watch what happens over 24 hours.
We think that walking is important for getting away from predators and finding mates for breeding.
While it can hard to imagine any movement in these enormous animals, giant clams up to 400 pounds can still walk, they just move slower.
During my PhD, I discovered more secrets about the giant clams.
But there was something missing in my work.
I found myself asking, "Why should people care about conserving giant clams?" -- other than myself, of course.
(Laughter)
It turns out that giant clams have a giant impact on coral reefs.
These multitasking clams are reef builders, food factories, shelters for shrimps and crabs and water filters, all rolled into one.
In a nutshell, giant clams play a major contributing role as residents of their own reef home, and just having them around keeps the reef healthy.
And because they can live up to 100 years old, giant clams make vital indicators of coral reef health.
So when giant clams start to disappear from coral reefs, their absence can serve as an alarm bell for scientists to start paying attention, similar to the canary in a coal mine.
But giant clams are endangered.
The largest clam in the world is facing the threat of extinction, with more than 50 percent of the wild population severely depleted.
And the ecological benefits of having giant clams on coral reefs are likely to continue only if populations are healthy, making their conservation paramount.
So I stand here today to give a voice to the giant clams, because I care a whole lot for these amazing animals, and they deserve to be cared for.
It is time for the giant clams to step out of their shells, and show the world that they, too, can be the heroes of the oceans.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Cities are like siblings in a large polygamous family.
Each one has a unique personality and is headed in a distinct direction.
But they all have somewhat shared origins.
Sometimes I think postcolonial cities are like the children of the two least-favorite wives, who are constantly being asked, "Ah, why can't you be more like your sister?"
(Laughter)
The "why" of cities is largely the same, no matter where they are: an advantageous location that makes trade and administration possible; the potential for scalable opportunities for the skilled and unskilled alike; a popular willingness to be in constant flux and, of course, resilience.
The "how" of cities, however, is a whole other story. How are they run? How do they grow? How do they decide who belongs and who doesn't?
Lagos is my home. You can always find the Nigerians by following the noise and the dancing, right?
(Laughter)
Like any major city, that place is a lot of things, many of which are highly contradictory.
Our public transportation doesn't quite work, so we have these privately owned bright yellow buses that regularly cause accidents.
Luxury car showrooms line badly maintained and often flooded roads.
Street evangelism is only slightly less ubiquitous than street harassment.
Sex workers sometimes have two degrees, a bank job and a prominent role in church.
(Laughter)
On any given day, there can be either a party or a burned body in the middle of a street.
There is so much that is possible in Lagos and so much that isn't, and very often the difference between possibility and impossibility is simply who you are, and if you're lucky enough, who you're connected to.
Belonging in Lagos is a fluid concept determined by ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender, but most visibly and often most violently, class.
Before Nigeria became a country, fisherpeople from the inland creeks started to come down the Lagos lagoon and establish villages along the coast.
About 60 years later, my grandfather, Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi, also arrived in Lagos.
Like me, he was an alumnus of the University of Ibadan, a young member of the educated elite in the independence era.
Over time, he built an illustrious career as a land surveyor, mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods when they were just waist-high wild grass.
He died when I was nine.
And by that time, my family, like the families of those fisherpeople, knew Lagos as home.
Among the Yoruba, we have a saying, "Èkó gb ’ olè, ó gb ’ ọ̀lẹ," which can be translated to mean that Lagos will welcome anyone.
But that saying is becoming less and less true.
Many Lagosians, including the descendants of those fisherpeople who arrived generations before my grandfather, are now being pushed out to make room for an emergent city that has been described as "the new Dubai." You see, Lagos inspires big dreams, even in its leaders, and successive governments have declared aspirations towards a megacity where poverty does not exist.
Unfortunately, instead of focusing on the eradication of poverty as you would expect, the strategy of choice focuses on eliminating the poor.
Last October, the Governor announced plans to demolish every single waterfront settlement in Lagos.
There are more than 40 of these indigenous communities all over the city, with over 300,000 people living in them.
Otodo Gbame, a hundred-year-old fishing village with a population about three-quarters that of Monaco and similar potential for beachfront luxury --
(Laughter)
was one of the first to be targeted.
I first heard of Otodo Gbame after the demolition started.
When I visited in November 2016, I met Magdalene Aiyefoju.
She is a now-homeless woman whose surname means, "the world is blind." Magdalene's son Basil was one of over 20 people who were shot, drowned or presumed dead in that land grab.
Standing outside her shelter, I saw the two white-sand football fields where Basil used to play.
Spread all around us were the ruins of schools, churches, a primary health center, shops, thousands of homes.
Young children enthusiastically helped to put up shelters, and about 5,000 of the residents, with nowhere else to go, simply stayed put.
And then in April, state security personnel came back.
This time, they cleared the community out completely, with beatings, bullets and fire.
As I speak, there are construction crews preparing Otodo Gbame's beaches for anyone who can afford a multi-million-dollar view.
The new development is called "Periwinkle Estate."
Forced evictions are incredibly violent and, of course, unconstitutional.
And yet, they happen so often in so many of our cities, because the first thing we are taught to forget about poor people is that they are people.
We believe that a home is a thing a person absolutely has a right to, unless the person is poor and the home is built a certain way in a certain neighborhood.
But there is no single definition of the word "home." After all, what is a slum besides an organic response to acute housing deficits and income inequality?
And what is a shanty if not a person making a home for themselves against all odds?
Slums are an imperfect housing solution, but they are also prime examples of the innovation, adaptability and resilience at the foundation -- and the heart -- of every functional city.
You don't need to be the new Dubai when you're already Lagos.
(Applause)
We have our own identity, our own rhythm, and as anyone who knows Lagos can tell you, poor Lagosians are very often the source of the city's character.
Without its poor, Lagos would not be known for its music or its endless energy or even the fact that you can buy an ice cold drink or a puppy through your car window.
(Laughter)
The conditions that cause us to define certain neighborhoods as slums can be effectively improved, but not without recognizing the humanity and the agency of the people living in them.
In Lagos, where public goods are rarely publicly available, slum dwellers are often at the forefront of innovating solutions.
After being disconnected from the grid for months because the power company couldn't figure out how to collect bills, one settlement designed a system that collectivized remittances and got everyone cheaper rates into the bargain.
Another settlement created a reform program that hires local bad boys as security.
They know every trick and every hideout, so now troublemakers are more likely to get caught and reported to police and fewer of the youth end up engaging in criminal activity.
Yet another settlement recently completed a flood-safe, eco-friendly communal toilet system.
Models like these are being adopted across Lagos.
Informal settlements are incorrectly named as the problem.
In fact, the real problems are the factors that create them, like the entrenchment of poverty, social exclusion and state failures.
When our governments frame slums as threats in order to justify violent land grabs or forced evictions, they're counting on those of us who live in formal housing to tacitly and ignorantly agree with them.
Rather, we must remind them that governments exist to serve not only those who build and live in luxury homes, but also those who clean and guard them. Our --
(Applause)
our realities may differ, but our rights don't.
The Lagos state government, like far too many on our continent, pays lip service to ideas of inclusion, while acting as though progress can only be achieved by the erasure, exploitation and even elimination of groups it considers expendable.
People living with disabilities who hawk or beg on Lagos streets are rounded up, extorted and detained.
Women in low-income neighborhoods are picked up and charged with prostitution, regardless of what they actually do for a living.
Gay citizens are scapegoated to distract from real political problems.
But people, like cities, are resilient, and no amount of legislation or intimidation or violence can fully eliminate any of us.
Prostitutes, women and women who work as prostitutes still haven't gone extinct, despite centuries of active suppression.
Queer Africans continue to exist, even though queerness is now criminalized in most parts of the continent.
And I'm fairly certain that poor people don't generally tend to just disappear because they've been stripped of everything they have.
We are all already here, and that answers the question of whether or not we belong.
When those fisherpeople started to sail down the lagoon in search of new homes, it could not have occurred to them that the city that would rise up around them would one day insist that they do not belong in it.
I like to believe that my grandfather, in mapping new frontiers for Lagos, was trying to open it up to make room for other people to be welcomed by the city in the same way that he was.
On my way here, my grandma called me to remind me how proud she was, how proud [my grandfather] and my mother would have been.
I am their dreams come true.
But there is no reason why their dreams -- or mine, for that matter -- are allowed to come true while those of others are turned to nightmares.
And lest we forget: the minimum requirement for a dream is a safe place to lay your head.
It is too late now for Basil, but not for Magdalene, not for the hundreds of thousands, the millions still under threat in Lagos or any of our cities.
The world does not have to remain blind to the suffering that is created when we deny people's humanity, or even to the incredible potential for growth that exists when we recognize and value all contributions.
We must hold our governments and ourselves accountable for keeping our shared cities safe for everyone in them, because the only cities worth building -- indeed, the only futures worth dreaming of -- are those that include all of us, no matter who we are or how we make homes for ourselves.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, I teach college students about inequality and race in education, and I like to leave my office open to any of my students who might just want to see me to chat.
And a few semesters ago, one of my more cheerful students, Mahari, actually came to see me and mentioned that he was feeling a bit like an outcast because he's black.
He had just transferred to NYU from a community college on a merit scholarship, and turns out, only about five percent of students at NYU are black.
And so I started to remember that I know that feeling of being an outsider in your own community.
It's partially what drew me to my work.
At my university, I'm one of the few faculty members of color, and growing up, I experienced my family's social mobility, moving out of apartments into a nice house, but in an overwhelmingly white neighborhood.
I was 12, and kids would say that were surprised that I didn't smell like curry.
(Laughter)
That's because school is in the morning, and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.
(Laughter)
Curry is for dinner.
(Laughter)
So when Mahari was leaving, I asked him how he was coping with feeling isolated.
And he said that despite feeling lonely, he just threw himself at his work, that he built strategies around his grit and his desire to be successful.
A mentor of mine is actually Dr. Angela Duckworth, the psychologist at UPenn who has defined this stick-to-itiveness of grit as being "the perseverance and passion for long-term goals." Angela's book has become a bestseller, and schools across the country, particularly charter schools, have become interested in citing "grit" as a core value.
But sometimes grit isn't enough, especially in education.
So when Mahari was leaving my office, I worried that he might need something more specific to combat the challenges that he mentioned to me.
As a sociologist, I also study achievement, but from a slightly different perspective.
I research students who have overcome immense obstacles related to their background.
Students from low-income, often single-parent households, students who have been homeless, incarcerated or perhaps undocumented, or some who have struggled with substance abuse or lived through violent or sexual trauma.
So let me tell you about two of the grittiest people I've met.
Tyrique was raised by a single mother, and then after high school, he fell in with the wrong crowd.
He got arrested for armed robbery.
But in prison, he started to work hard.
He took college credit courses, so when he got out, he was able to get a master's, and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.
Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid, from the Lower East Side to Staten Island to the Bronx.
She was raised primarily by her extended family, because her own mother had a heroin addiction.
Yet at 15, Vanessa had to drop out of school, and she had a son of her own.
But eventually, she was able to go to community college, get her associate's, then go to an elite college to finish her bachelor's.
So some people might hear these stories and say, "Yes, those two definitely have grit.
They basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps." But that's an incomplete picture, because what's more important is that they had factors in their lives that helped to influence their agency, or their specific capacity to actually overcome the obstacles that they were facing and navigate the system given their circumstances.
So, allow me to elaborate. In prison, Tyrique was actually aimless at first, as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.
This is until an older detainee took him aside and asked him to help with the youth program.
And in mentoring youth, he started to see his own mistakes and possibilities in the teens.
This is what got him interested in taking college-credit courses.
And when he got out, he got a job with Fortune Society, where many executives are people who have been formerly incarcerated.
So then he was able to get a master's in social work, and today, he even lectures at Columbia about prison reform.
And Vanessa... well, after the birth of her son, she happened to find a program called Vocational Foundation that gave her 20 dollars biweekly, a MetroCard and her first experiences with a computer.
These simple resources are what helped her get her GED, but then she suffered from a very serious kidney failure, which was particularly problematic because she was only born with one kidney.
She spent 10 years on dialysis waiting for a successful transplant.
After that, her mentors at community college had kept in touch with her, and so she was able to go, and they put her in an honors program.
And that's the pathway that allowed her to become accepted to one of the most elite colleges for women in the country, and she received her bachelor's at 36, setting an incredible example for her young son.
What these stories primarily indicate is that teaching is social and benefits from social scaffolding.
There were factors pushing these two in one direction, but through tailored mentorship and opportunities, they were able to reflect on their circumstances and resist negative influences.
They also learned simple skills like developing a network, or asking for help -- things many of us in this room can forget that we have needed from time to time, or can take for granted.
And when we think of people like this, we should only think of them as exceptional, but not as exceptions.
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us of the collective responsibility to help students in similar situations.
When Presidents Bush, Obama and now even Trump, have called education "the civil rights issue of our time," perhaps we should treat it that way.
If schools were able to think about the agency that their students have and bring to the table when they push them, what students learn can become more relevant to their lives, and then they can tap into those internal reservoirs of grit and character.
So this here -- My student Mahari got accepted to law school with scholarships, and not to brag, but I did write one of his letters of recommendation.
(Laughter)
And even though I know hard work is what got him this achievement, I've seen him find his voice along the way, which as someone who's grown up a little bit shy and awkward, I know it takes time and support.
So even though he will rely a lot on his grit to get him through that first-year law school grind, I'll be there as a mentor for him, check in with him from time to time, maybe take him out to get some curry ...
(Laughter)
so that he can keep growing his agency to succeed even more.
Thank you.
Caitlin Quattromani: The election of 2016 felt different.
Political conversations with our family and friends uncovered a level of polarization that many of us had not previously experienced.
People who we always thought were reasonable and intelligent seemed like strangers.
We said to ourselves, "How could you think that?
I thought you were smart."
Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met in the summer of 2011, and we bonded around being working moms and trying to keep our very energetic boys busy.
And we soon found out we had almost everything in common.
From our love of Colorado to our love of sushi, there wasn't much we didn't agree on.
We also discovered that we share a deep love of this country and feel a responsibility to be politically active.
But no one's perfect --
(Laughter) and I soon found out two disappointing things about Caitlin.
First, she hates camping.
CQ: I think camping is the worst.
LA: So there would not be any joint camping trips in our future.
The second thing is that she's politically active all right -- as a conservative.
CQ: I may hate camping, but I love politics.
I listen to conservative talk radio just about every day, and I've volunteered for a few different conservative political campaigns.
LA: And I'd say I'm a little to the left, like all the way to the left.
(Laughter)
I've always been interested in politics.
I was a political science major, and I worked as a community organizer and on a congressional campaign.
CQ: So as Lauran and I were getting to know each other, it was right in the middle of that 2012 presidential campaign, and most of our early political conversations were really just based in jokes and pranks.
So as an example, I would change Lauran's computer screen saver to a picture of Mitt Romney, or she would put an Obama campaign magnet on the back of my car.
LA: Car, not minivan.
CQ: But over time, those conversations grew more serious and really became a core of our friendship.
And somewhere along the line, we decided we didn't want to have any topic be off limits for discussion, even if those topics pushed us way outside of our friendship comfort zone.
LA: And so to most of us, political conversations are a zero-sum game.
There's a winner and there's a loser.
We go for the attack and we spot a weakness in someone's argument.
And here's the important part: we tend to take every comment or opinion that's expressed as a personal affront to our own values and beliefs.
But what if changed the way we think about these conversations?
What if, in these heated moments, we chose dialogue over debate?
When we engage in dialogue, we flip the script.
We replace our ego and our desire to win with curiosity, empathy and a desire to learn.
Instead of coming from a place of judgment, we are genuinely interested in the other person's experiences, their values and their concerns.
CQ: You make it sound so simple, Lauran.
But getting to that place of true dialogue is hard, especially when we're talking about politics.
It is so easy to get emotionally fired up about issues that we're passionate about, and we can let our ego get in the way of truly hearing the other person's perspective.
And in this crazy political climate we're in right now, unfortunately, we're seeing an extreme result of those heated political conversations, to the point where people are willing to walk away from their relationships.
In fact, Rasmussen released a poll earlier this year that said 40 percent of people reported that the 2016 election negatively impacted a personal relationship, and the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience tells us that people tend to feel their way to their beliefs rather than using reasoning, and that when reason and emotion collide, it's emotion that invariably wins.
So no wonder it's hard to talk about these issues.
LA: And look, we're just two regular friends who happen to think very differently about politics and the role that government should play in our lives.
And I know we were all taught not to talk about politics because it's not polite, but we need to be able to talk about it, because it's important to us and it's a part of who we are.
CQ: We have chosen to avoid political debate and instead engage in dialogue in order to maintain what we fondly call our bipartisan friendship.
(Laughter)
LA: And this election and all of the craziness that has followed has given us several opportunities to practice this skill.
(Laughter)
Let's start with January and the Women's March.
At this point, you can probably guess which one of us participated.
CQ: Oh, the Women's March.
I was annoyed and irritated that entire day, really because of two things.
Number one, the name "Women's March." As a conservative woman, the march's platform of issues didn't represent me, and that's OK, but hearing it talked about as this demonstration of sisterhood and solidarity for all women didn't ring true for me.
The other piece was the timing of the event, the fact that it was the day after the presidential inauguration.
It felt like we weren't even giving the new administration to actually do anything, good or bad, before people felt the need to demonstrate against it.
LA: And under normal circumstances, I would agree with Caitlin.
I think an administration does deserve the benefit of the doubt.
But in this case, I was marching to show my concern that a man with such a poor track record with women and other groups had been elected as president.
I had to be part of the collective voice that wanted to send a clear message to the new president that we did not accept or condone his behavior or rhetoric during the election.
CQ: So I'm already feeling kind of aggravated, and then I see this Facebook from Lauran pop up in my social media feed.
(Laughter)
Seeing Lauran's sons at the march and holding signs took it to a new level for me, and not in a good way, because I know these boys, I love these boys, and I didn't feel they were old enough to understand what the march stood for.
I didn't understand why Lauran would choose to have them participate in that way, and I assumed it wasn't a choice that the boys made for themselves.
But I also know Lauran.
You're an incredible mom who would never exploit your boys in any way, so I had to stop and check myself.
I had a decision to make.
I could take the easy way out and just choose not to say anything to her, and instead just kind of simmer in my frustration, or I could ask her to learn more about her motivations.
LA: And I shared with Caitlin that we actually started talking about the March weeks before we participated.
And my boys were curious as to why the event was being organized, and this led to some very interesting family conversations.
We talked about how in this country, we have the right and the privilege to demonstrate against something we don't agree with, and my husband shared with them why he thought it was so important that men joined the Women's March.
But the most significant reason we marched as a family is that it was a way for us to honor my parents' legacy.
They spent their careers working to defend the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens, and they passed these values down to me and my brother, and we want to do the same with our sons.
CQ: After talking to Lauran, I really understood not only why she felt it was so important to march, but why she had her boys with her.
And frankly, my assumptions were wrong.
It was the boys who wanted to march after they talked about the issues as a family.
But what's most important about this example is to think about the alternative.
Had Lauran and I not talked about it, I would have been annoyed with her, and it could have resulted in an undercurrent of disrespect in our friendship.
But by asking Lauran questions, it allowed us to use dialogue to get to a place of true understanding.
Now, to be clear, our conversation didn't really change my mind about how I felt about the March, but it absolutely changed my thinking around why she brought her boys with her.
And for both of us, that dialogue allowed us to understand each other's perspective about the Women's March even though we disagreed.
LA: The second topic that challenged our ability to engage in dialogue was around my need to understand how Caitlin could vote for Trump.
(Laughter)
Caitlin is a successful professional woman who is deeply caring and compassionate, and the Caitlin I know would never excuse any man from talking about women the way that Trump did during the campaign.
It was hard for me to reconcile these two things in my mind.
How could you overlook the things that were said?
CQ: So I'm guessing I may not be the only one here that thought we didn't have the best choices for the presidential election last year.
(Laughter)
The Republican candidate who I did support didn't make it out of the primary, so when it came time to vote, I had a decision to make.
And you're right, there were some terrible things that came out during the Trump campaign, so much so that I almost decided to just abstain rather than voting for president, something I had never even considered doing before.
But ultimately, I did vote for Donald Trump, and for me it was really a vote for party over person, especially recognizing how important that presidential pick is on influencing our judicial branch.
But I shared with Lauran it was a decision I really wrestled with, and not one that I made lightly.
LA: And so after our conversation, I was struck by a few things.
First, I had fallen victim to my own confirmation bias.
Because of my strong feelings about Trump, I had given all Trump voters the same attributes, and none of them forgiving.
(Laughter) But knowing Caitlin, I started to ask questions.
What were Trump voters really concerned about?
Under all the divisive language, what was really going on?
What could we learn about ourselves and our country from this unlikely event?
I also learned that we shared a deep disappointment in this election, and that we have growing concerns about our two-party political system.
But the most important thing about this conversation is that it happened at all.
Without an open and honest dialogue between the two of us, this election would have been the elephant in the room for the next four years, pun intended.
CQ: So, look --
So, look -- we know it takes work to get past the difficult, frustrating and sometimes emotional parts of having discussions about issues like the Women's March or why your friend may have voted for a candidate that you can't stand.
But we need to have these conversations.
Our ability to move past political debate into true dialogue is a critical skill we should all be focused on right now, especially with the people that we care about the most.
LA: And it's not just as adults that we need to bottle this behavior.
It's critical that we do it for our children as well.
My sons were inundated with this election.
We were listening to the news in the morning, and they were having conversations with their friends at school.
I was concerned that they were picking up so much polarizing misinformation, and they were growing really fearful of a Trump presidency.
Then one day, after the election, I was taking my sons to school, and my younger son, completely out of the blue, said, "Mom, we don't know anybody who voted for Trump, right?"
(Laughter)
And I paused and I took a deep breath. "Yes, we do."
(Laughter)
"The Quattromanis." And his response was so great.
He kind of got this confused look on his face, and he said ... "But we love them."
(Laughter)
And I answered, "Yes, we do."
(Laughter)
And then he said, "Why would they vote for him?" And I remember stopping and thinking that it was really important how I answered this question.
Somehow, I had to honor our own family values and show respect for our friends.
So I finally said, "They think that's the right direction for this country." And before I had even gotten the whole sentence out, he had moved on to the soccer game he was going to play at recess.
CQ: So life with boys.
(Laughter)
So what Lauran and I have discovered through our bipartisan friendship is the possibility that lives in dialogue.
We have chosen to be genuinely curious about each other's ideas and perspectives and to be willing to listen to one another even when we disagree.
And by putting aside our ego and our preconceived ideas, we've opened ourselves up to limitless learning.
And perhaps most importantly for our relationship, we have made the commitment to each other that our friendship is way more important than either of us being right or winning a conversation about politics.
So today, we're asking you to have a conversation.
Talk to someone outside of your political party who might challenge your thinking.
Make an effort to engage with someone with whom you might typically avoid a political conversation.
But remember, the goal isn't to win, the goal is to listen and to understand and to be open to learning something new.
LA: So let's go back to election night.
As the polls were closing and it became clear that Trump was going to be our new president, I was devastated.
I was sad, I was confused, and I'll be honest -- I was angry.
And then just before midnight, I received this text message from Caitlin.
And where there so easy could have been weeks or months of awkwardness and unspoken hostility, there was this -- an offering of empathy rooted in friendship.
And I knew, in that moment, that we would make it through this.
CQ: So we must find a way to engage in meaningful conversations that are going to move us forward as a nation, and we can no longer wait for our elected officials to elevate our national discourse.
LA: The challenges ahead are going to require all of us to participate in a deeper and more meaningful way ... and it starts with each one of us building connection through dialogue -- in our relationships, our communities and as a country.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was there on a field trip with my architecture students from Zurich. And when we reached a high valley, I surprised them with the news that there was no hut or hotel booked for the night.
It was not a mistake.
It was totally on purpose.
The challenge was to build our own shelter with whatever we could find.
And we all survived.
It was cold, it was really tough ... and it was a great learning experience to discover that there are a lot of resources given by nature for free, and all that we need is our sensitivity to see them ... and our creativity to use them.
I found myself in a similar situation. When I was an architecture student about 13 years ago, I went to Bangladesh to a remote village called Rudrapur with the aim to design and build a school as my thesis project.
I had lived in that village before when I was 19 and a volunteer at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO for rural development.
And what I had learned from them was that the most sustainable strategy for sustainable development is to cherish and to use your very own resources and potential, and not get dependent on external factors.
And this is what I tried to do with my architecture as well.
In terms of suitable building materials for my school, I didn't have to look far.
They were right under my feet: mud, earth, dirt, clay, however you call it ... and bamboo that was growing all around.
Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare, but we didn't need it.
We had human energy and the people were happy to have the work.
Tools were an issue, too, but we had these guys, water buffalos.
We had also tried a bit cows, but interestingly, they were too intelligent.
They were always stepping in the holes of the previous round.
They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw -- (Laughter)
the sand, which are the ingredients in the walls.
And except a small team of consultants like my partner for realization, Eike Roswag, and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel, it was all built by craftsmen from the village.
And this is the METI school after six months of construction.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Load-bearing earth walls that really ground the school, and large bamboo structures that bring the lightness in.
That's the classroom on the ground floor.
Attached to it are the caves.
They're for reading, for snuggling, for solo work, for meditation, for playing ... and the classroom on the top.
The children all signed with their names in Bengali the doors, and they did not only sign, they also helped building the school.
And I'm sure you all had your hands in mud or clay before.
It's wonderful to touch. I love it. The children loved it.
And can you imagine the feeling of a small boy or a girl or an illiterate day laborer standing in front of that school building and knowing that you built this out of the ordinary bamboo and just the dirt underneath your feet, using nothing but your hands?
That gives such an enormous boost of trust and confidence in yourself and the community.
And in the material. Especially mud has a very poor image.
When we think of mud, we think of dirt -- it's ugly, it's nondurable -- and this is the image I want to change.
In fact, it's the 11th rainy season for this school now, really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains, and the walls are standing strong.
(Applause)
So how does it work?
First rule, a good foundation that keeps the wall dry from the ground, and second rule, a good roof that protects from the top, and third rule, erosion control.
Mud walls need speed breakers so that the rainwater cannot run down the wall fast, and these speed breakers could be lines of bamboo or stones or straw mixed into the mud, just like a hill needs trees or rocks in order to prevent erosion.
It works just the same way.
And people always ask me if I have to add cement to the mud, and the answer is no.
There is no stabilizer, no coating on these walls, only in the foundation.
So this is the close-up of the wall after 10 rainy seasons, and as much as I grew a bit older, the wall got some wrinkles as well.
The edges my not be as sharp as before, but it still looks pretty good, and if it needs repairing, it is really easy to do.
You just take the broken part, make it wet, and put it back on the wall, and it will look the same as before.
Wish that would work on me, too.
(Laughter)
Yeah, and the great thing is, if an earth wall is not needed anymore, it can go back to the ground it came from, turn into a garden, or get fully recycled without any loss of quality.
There's no other material that can do this, and this is why mud is so excellent in terms of environmental performance.
What about the economic sustainability?
When we built the school, I practically lived on the construction site, and in the evening, I used to go with the workers to the market, and I could see how they spent their money.
And they would buy the vegetables from their neighbors, they would get a new haircut or a new blouse from the tailor.
And because the main part of the building budget was spent on craftsmanship, the school wasn't just a building, it became a real catalyst for local development, and that made me happy.
If I had designed the school in cement and steel, this money would have been exported and lost for those families.
(Applause)
The building budget at that time was 35,000 euros -- it's probably doubled by now -- and this is a lot of money for that region, and especially because this money is working within the community and rotating fast, and not on the stock market.
So when it comes to the economic sustainability of my project, my main question is, who gets the profit?
How many of you in here have some experience living in a mud house?
Chris Anderson, where is your hand?
(Laughter)
You? OK.
Yeah. It seems totally out of our focus, but approximately three billion people all around the planet are living in earth houses, and it is a traditional building material in Europe just as much as in Africa.
Strangely enough, mud is not considered worthy of being studied at universities ... so I brought the dirt to Harvard,
(Laughter)
precisely 60 tons of dirt right in front of the main facade of the Graduate School of Design.
Students and faculty rolled up their sleeves, got their hands dirty and transformed the front into a warm place for people to gather.
Children would climb the structures, skaters would ride the ramp, students having lunch breaks, and it was particularly fascinating to see how many people were touching the wall, and we usually don't go around cities caressing our facades, right?
(Laughter)
Of course, this was a small-scale project, but in terms of awareness-building and in terms of education, it was like an acupuncture trigger point.
And in fact, in more and more countries, load-bearing earthen structures are not allowed to be built anymore although they're traditional and have lasted for hundreds of years, and not because the material is weak, but because there are no architects and engineers who know how to deal with that material.
So education on all levels, for craftsmen, engineers and architects, is really strongly needed.
Equally important is technological development, like prefabrication developed by my colleague Martin Rauch, who is an Austrian artist and expert in earthen structures.
And he has created technologies for rammed earth elements, for prefabrication of rammed earth elements that include insulation, wall heatings and coolings and all sorts of electrical fittings that can be layered to multistoried buildings, and this is important in order to scale up and in order to [speed] up the processes, like in the Ricola Herb Center in Switzerland.
And finally, we need good built projects that prove you can build with an ancient material in a very modern way.
It is not a matter of how old a material is; it's a matter of our creative ability to use it today.
These, for example, are three hostels that I did in China in the village Baoxi, about six hours by bus from Shanghai.
The outside shape is woven bamboo, and the inside core is stones and rammed earth. And it is a traditional building material.
Even large parts of the Great Wall of China have been built with rammed earth, but it's getting replaced by concrete.
And this trend is happening very fast.
Within only a couple of years, China has consumed more cement than the United States in the entire 20th century.
And this trend of replacing natural building materials with materials that require a lot of energy, that are energy-intensive, and that emit CO2 is really clearly contributing to climate change.
And we have alternatives, such as mud, stones, timber, bamboo, earth, that are totally effective options for all sorts of purposes.
This, for example, is an office building that we did for Omicron Electronics in Austria.
Mud is healthy for the planet, but also for the human bodies, and the material is low-tech, but the performance is high-tech.
The earth walls keep the highly sophisticated tools in the building safe by naturally regulating moisture.
And this wall in my own home is our humidfier.
We love our six tons of dirt at home not only because it's healthy and sustainable.
Its archaic warmth is touching deep within.
My personal dream is to build a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan.
(Laughter)
Yeah.
And this dream isn't so crazy if you think of the mud city of Shibam in Yemen that was built in the 16th century and has lasted now for 500 years.
What was possible that long ago is possible today as well, and we can apply all our technical know-how to these ancient materials so that it meets our needs and our dreams.
All around us, and just below our feet ... are wonderful natural building materials. Let's use them. And I deeply believe our homes, our work spaces, our cities would become more healthy and sustainable and more humane and beautiful.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, Ma was trying to explain something to me about Grandma and when they grew up, but I couldn't pay attention to her because I was five years old, and I was petrified.
I had just seen The Green Lady.
Now, about a week earlier, I'd watched that movie "Godzilla," the one about that huge lizard-like beast storming a major city, and the thought of a green monster coming for me was stuck in my mind.
And yet there I was, at the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom, just staring at her: her horns, her muscles -- all of it just frightened me.
And I didn't know whether she was a monster or a hero.
So I decided to consult the Google of the day -- "Ma! Ma!"
(Laughter)
My mother explained that The Green Lady is actually the Statue of Liberty and that she was waving immigrants in.
Now, the part of her explanation that really messed with my young head was the fact that, according to Ma, long before us, The Green Lady was actually brown, brown like me, and that she changed colors over the years, much like America.
Now, the part that really is intriguing about this is that when she changed colors, she made me think about myself.
It all made sense to me, because as a first-generation American, I was surrounded by immigrants.
In fact, within my immediate social circle of the people who support me, who enrich my life, at least two are foreign-born.
My life as a US citizen is in many ways shaped by newcomers, and chances are, so is yours.
There are more than 40 million immigrants in the USA.
According to census data, a quarter of the nation's children have at least one foreign-born parent.
I know all these statistics because I study global migration patterns.
I'm a journalist, and for the last few years, I've been documenting the lives of US citizens who've lost people to deportation.
And the numbers are enormous.
From 2008 to 2016, more than three million people were "ordered removed" -- that's the technical term for being deported.
There is an economic, a political, a psychological and an emotional cost to those deportations -- the moments when these circles are broken.
I once asked a US soldier, "Why did you volunteer to fight this war?"
And she told me, "Because I'm proud to defend my country."
But I pressed to know — "Really, when you're on base, and you hear bombs exploding in the distance, and you see soldiers coming back who are gravely injured, in that moment, when you know you could be next, what does' my country 'mean?"
She looked at me. "My country is my wife, my family, my friends, my soldiers." What she was telling me is that "my country" is a collection of these strong relationships; these social circles.
When the social circles are weakened, a country itself is weaker.
We're missing a crucial aspect in the debate about immigration policy.
Rather than focusing on individuals, we should focus on the circles around them, because these are the people who are left behind: the voters, the taxpayers, the ones who are suffering that loss.
And it's not just the children of the deported who are impacted.
You have brothers and sisters who are separated by borders.
You have classmates, teachers, law enforcement officers, technologists, scientists, doctors, who are all scrambling to make sense of new realities when their social circles are broken.
These are the real lives behind all these statistics that dominate discussions about immigration policy.
But we don't often think about them.
And I'm trying to change that.
Here's just one of the real-life stories that I've collected.
And it still haunts me.
I met Ramon and his son in 2016, the same year both of them were being ordered out of the country.
Ramon was being deported to Latin America, while his son, who was a sergeant in the US military, was being deployed. Deported... deployed. If you just look at Ramon's case, it wouldn't be clear how deeply connected to the country he is.
But consider his son: a US citizen defending a country that's banished his father.
The social circle is what's key here.
Here's another example that illustrates those critical bonds.
A group of citizens in Philadelphia were concerned about their jobs, because the legal owner of the restaurant where they worked was an undocumented immigrant, and immigration officials had picked him up.
They rallied behind him.
An immigration lawyer argued he was too important to the local community to be deported.
At the hearing, they even submitted restaurant reviews -- restaurant reviews!
In the end, a judge exercised what's called "judicial discretion" and allowed him to stay in the country, but only because they considered the social circle.
There are 23 million noncitizens in the USA, according to verifiable federal data.
And that doesn't include the undocumented, because numbers for that population are at best complex estimates.
Let's just work with what we have.
That's 23 million social circles -- about 100 million individuals whose lives could be impacted by deportation.
And the stress of it all is trickling down through the population.
A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents found that 30 percent of citizens in LA County are stressed about deportation, not because they themselves could be removed, but rather, because members of their social circle were at risk.
I am not suggesting that no one should ever be deported; don't confuse me with that.
But what I am saying is that we need to look at the bigger picture.
If you are within the sound of my voice, I want you to close your eyes for a moment and examine your own social circle.
Who are your foreign-born?
What would it feel like if the circle were broken?
Share your story. I'm building a global archive of first-person accounts and linking them with mapping technology, so that we can see exactly where these circles break, because this is not just an American issue.
There are a quarter-billion migrants around the world; people living, loving and learning in countries where they were not born.
And in my career, in my life, I've been one of them: in China, in Africa, in Europe.
And each time I become one of these foreigners -- one of these strange-looking guys in a new land -- I can't help but think back to that day when I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom all those decades ago, when I was scared, and I had just spotted that green lady.
And I guess the question that I keep on thinking about when I see her and all the younger replicas of her that are so obviously brown, and even the paintings that showcase her in the beginning as not quite green -- when I look at all of that, the question that my research seeks to answer becomes, to me, the same one that confounded me all those years ago: Is she a monster or a hero?
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'd like for you to take a moment to imagine this with me.
You're a little girl of five years old.
Sitting in front of a mirror, you ask yourself, "Do I exist?" In this space, there is very little context, and so you move into a different one, one filled with people.
Surely, now you know you're not a figment of your own imagination.
You breathe their air.
You see them, so they must see you.
And yet, you still can't help but wonder: Do I only exist when people speak to me?
Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?
But through various artworks that reflect upon our society, I came to understand how a young black girl can grow up feeling as if she's not seen, and perhaps she doesn't exist.
You see, if young people don't have positive images of themselves and all that remains are negative stereotypes, this affects their self-image.
But it also affects the way that the rest of society treats them.
I discovered this having lived in Cape Town for about five years at the time.
I felt a deep sense of dislocation and invisibility.
I couldn't see myself represented.
I couldn't see the women who've raised me, the ones who've influenced me, and the ones that have made South Africa what it is today.
I decided to do something about it.
What do you think when you see this?
If you were a black girl, how would it make you feel?
Walking down the street, what does the city you live in say to you?
What symbols are present? Which histories are celebrated? And on the other hand, which ones are omitted?
You see, public spaces are hardly ever as neutral as they may seem.
I discovered this when I made this performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.
Cape Town is teeming with masculine architecture, monuments and statues, such as Louis Botha in that photograph.
This overt presence of white colonial and Afrikaner nationalist men not only echoes a social, gender and racial divide, but it also continues to affect the way that women -- and the way, particularly, black women -- see themselves in relation to dominant male figures in public spaces.
For this reason, among others, I don't believe that we need statues.
The preservation of history and the act of remembering can be achieved in more memorable and effective ways.
As part of a year-long public holiday series, I use performance art as a form of social commentary to draw people's attention to certain issues, as well as addressing the absence of the black female body in memorialized public spaces, especially on public holidays.
Women's Day was coming up.
I looked at what the day means -- the Women's March to the union buildings in 1956, petitioning against the pass laws.
Juxtaposed with the hypocrisy of how women are treated, especially in public spaces today, I decided to do something about it.
Headline:
[Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank]
How do I comment on such polar opposites?
In the guise of my great-grandmother, I performed bare-breasted, close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.
This space is also called Freedom Square, where women were a part of demonstrations against apartheid laws.
I was not comfortable with women being seen as only victims in society.
You might wonder how people reacted to this.
(Video) Woman: (Cheering)
Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh?
(Applause)
So I realized that through my performances, I've been able to make regular people reflect upon their society, looking at the past as well as the current democracy.
(Video) Man (offscreen): She's been there since three o'clock.
Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three.
About an hour still?
Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day.
Man 1: It's very interesting.
It's very powerful.
I think it's cool.
I think a lot of people are quick to join a group that's a movement towards something, but not many people are ready to do something as an individual.
Man 2: So it's the individual versus the collective.
Man 1: Yeah. So I think her pushing her own individual message in performance ... it's powerful.
Yeah, I think it's quite powerful that she's doing it on her own.
I'd be interested to know why she's using hair extensions as wings, or whatever those things are meant to be.
They are wings, yes?
Woman 3: With her standing there right now, I think it's just my interpretation that we are bringing the statue down and bringing up something that's supposed to represent African pride, I think.
Or something like that.
Something should stand while Rhodes falls, I think that's what it's saying. Yeah. Yes. Thank you.
Man 3: What is behind me represents the African culture.
We can't have the colonialist law, so we need to remove all these colonial statues.
We have have our own statues now, our African leaders -- Bhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah -- all those who paid their lives for our liberation.
We can't continue in the 21st century, and after 21 years of democracy, have the colonizers in our own country. They belong somewhere. Maybe in a museum; not here.
I mean learning institutions, places where young people, young minds are being shaped.
So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha, Rhodes, all these people, because they're representing the colonialism.
Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015, the Cecil John Rhodes statue was scheduled to be removed after a month of debates for and against its removal by various stakeholders.
This caused a widespread interest in statues in South Africa.
Opinions varied, but the media focused on problematizing the removal of statues.
On that -- well, that year, I had just begun my master's at the University of Cape Town.
During the time of the debate of the statue, I had been having reoccurring dreams about a bird.
And so I started conjuring her mentally, spiritually and through dress.
On that day, I happened to be having a meeting with my supervisors, and they told me that the statue was going to fall on that day.
I told them that I'd explain later, but we had to postpone the meeting because I was going to perform her as the statue came down.
Her name was Chapungu. She was a soapstone bird that was looted from Great Zimbabwe in the late 1800s, and is still currently housed in Cecil John Rhodes's estate in Cape Town.
On that day, I embodied her existence using my body, while standing in the blazing sun for nearly four hours.
As the time came, the crane came alive.
The people did, too -- shouting, screaming, clenching their fists and taking pictures of the moment on their phones and cameras.
Chapungu's wings, along with the crane, rose to declare the fall of Cecil John Rhodes.
(Applause)
Euphoria filled the air as he became absent from his base, while she remained still, very present, half an hour after his removal.
Twenty-three years after apartheid, a new generation of radicals has arisen in South Africa.
The story of Chapungu and Rhodes in the same space and time asks important questions related to gender, power, self-representation, history making and repatriation.
From then on, I realized that my spiritual beliefs and dreams texture my material reality.
But for me, Chapungu's story felt incomplete.
This soapstone bird, a spiritual medium and messenger of God and the ancestors, needed me to continue her story.
And so I dabbled in the dream space a little bit more, and this is how "Falling" was born.
[A film by Sethembile Msezane]
(Video) (A capella singing)
[FALLING]
In the film, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germany share a common story about the soapstone birds that were looted from Great Zimbabwe.
After Zimbabwe gained its independence, all the birds except for one were returned to the monument. "Falling" explores the mythological belief that there will be unrest until the final bird is returned.
Through my work, I have realized a lot about the world around me: how we move through spaces, who we choose to celebrate and who we remember.
Now I look in the mirror and not only see an image of myself, but of the women who have made me who I am today.
I stand tall in my work, celebrating women's histories, in the hope that perhaps one day, no little black girl has to ever feel like she doesn't exist.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What stands between Africa's current prostrate condition and a future of prosperity and abundance for its long-suffering populations?
One word: knowledge.
If Africa is to become a continent that offers the best life for humans, it must become a knowledge society immediately.
This is what I have called "Africa's knowledge imperative."
Our universities must reduce emphasis on producing manpower for running our civil society, our economy and our political institutions.
They should be dedicated mainly to knowledge production.
What sense is there in producing civil engineers who are not supported by soil scientists and geologists, who make it their business to create knowledge about our soil and our rocks?
What use is there in producing lawyers without juries who produce knowledge of the underlying philosophical foundations of the legal system?
We must seek knowledge.
We must approach the matter of knowledge with a maniacal commitment, without let or hindrance.
Though we must seek knowledge to solve problems we know of, we must also seek knowledge when there is no problem in view -- especially when there is no problem in view.
We must seek to know as much of what there is to know of all things, limited only by the insufficiency of our human nature, and not only when the need arises.
Those who do not seek knowledge when it is not needed will not have it when they must have it.
The biggest crisis in Africa today is the crisis of knowledge: how to produce it, how to manage it, and how to deploy it effectively.
For instance, Africa does not have a water crisis.
It has a knowledge crisis regarding its water, where and what types it is, how it can be tapped and made available where and when needed to all and sundry.
How does a continent that is home to some of the largest bodies of water in the world -- the Nile, the Niger, the Congo, the Zambezi and the Orange Rivers -- be said to have a water crisis, including in countries where those rivers are?
And that is only surface water.
While we wrongly dissipate our energies fighting the wrong crises, all those who invest in knowledge about us are busy figuring out how to pipe water from Libya's aquifers to quench Europe's thirst.
Such is our knowledge of our water resources that many of our countries have given up on making potable water a routine presence in the lives of Africans, rich or poor, high and low, rural and urban.
We eagerly accept what the merchants of misery and the global African Studies safari professoriat and their aid-addled, autonomy-fearing African minions in government, universities and civil society tell us regarding how nature has been to stinting towards Africa when it comes to the distribution of water resources in the world.
We are content to run our cities and rural dwellings alike on boreholes.
How does one run metropolises on boreholes and wells?
Does Africa have a food crisis?
Again, the answer is no.
It is yet another knowledge crisis regarding Africa's agricultural resources, what and where they are, and how they can be best managed to make Africans live more lives that are worth living.
Otherwise, how does one explain the fact that geography puts the source of the River Nile in Ethiopia, and its people cannot have water for their lives?
And the same geography puts California in the desert, but it is a breadbasket.
The difference, obviously, is not geography. It is knowledge. Colorado's aquifers grow California's pistachios.
Why can't Libya's aquifers grow sorghum in northern Nigeria?
Why does Nigeria not aspire to feed the world, not just itself?
If Africa's land is so poor, as we are often told, why are outsiders, from the United Arab Emirates all the way to South Korea, buying up vast acreages of our land, to grow food, no less, to feed their people in lands that are truly more geographically stinting?
The new landowners are not planning to import new topsoil to make their African acquisitions more arable.
Again, a singular instance of knowledge deficiency.
In the 19th century, our predecessors, just years removed from the ravages of slavery and the slave trade, were exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers with a view to turning Africa's resources to the advantage of its people and to the rest of humanity, and their 20th-century successors were dreaming of harnessing the powers of the River Congo to light up the whole continent.
Now only buccaneer capitalists from Europe are scheming of doing the same, but for exports to Europe and South Africa.
And they are even suggesting that Congolese may not benefit from this scheme, because, according to them, Congolese communities are too small to make providing them with electricity a viable concern. The solution? Africa must become a knowledge society, a defining characteristic of the modern age.
We neither are, nor are we on the path to becoming, a knowledge society.
Things have not always been this way when it comes to knowledge production and Africa.
In antiquity, the world went to Africa for intellectual enrichment.
There were celebrated centers of learning, attracting questers from all parts of the then-known world, seeking knowledge about that world.
What happened then has implications for our present.
For example, how Roman Africa managed the relationship between settlers and natives between the second and fourth centuries of our era might have something to teach us when it comes to confronting not-too-dissimilar problems at the present time.
But how many classics departments do we have in our universities?
Because we do not invest in knowledge, people come to Africa now not as a place of intellectual enrichment, but as a place where they sate their thirst for exotica.
Yet for the last half-millennium, Africa has been hemorrhaging and exporting knowledge to the rest of the world.
Regardless of the popular description of it as a trade in bodies, the European trans-Atlantic slave trade and slavery was one of the most radical and longest programs of African brains export in history.
American slave owners may have pretended that Africans were mere brutes, beasts of burden, almost as inert and dumb as other farm implements they classified them with in their ledgers.
And that's what they did.
The enslaved Africans, on the other hand, knew their were embodiments of knowledge.
They were smiths, they were poets, they were political counselors, they were princes and princesses, they were mythologists, they were herbologists, they were chefs.
The list is endless.
They, to take a single example, brought the knowledge of rice cultivation to the American South.
They created some of the most original civilizational elements for which the United States is now celebrated.
They deployed their knowledge, for the most part, without compensation.
For the last half-millennium, beginning with the slave trade, Africa has been exporting brains while simultaneously breaking the chains of knowledge transmission on the continent itself, with dire consequences for the systems of knowledge production in Africa.
Successive generations are cut off from the intellectual production of their predecessors.
We keep producing for external markets while beggaring our own internal needs.
At present, much of the best knowledge about Africa is neither produced nor housed there, even when it is produced by Africans.
Because we are dominated by immediate needs and relevant solutions when it comes to what we should know, we are happy to hand over to others the responsibility to produce knowledge, including knowledge about, of and for us, and to do so far away from us.
We are ever eager to consume knowledge and have but a mere portion of it without any anxiety about ownership and location.
African universities are now all too content to have e-connections with libraries elsewhere, having given up ambitions on building libraries to which the world would come for intellectual edification.
Control over who decides what should be stocked on our shelves and how access to collections should be determined are made to rest on our trust in our partners' good faith that they will not abandon us down the road. This must change. Africa must become a place of knowledge again.
Knowledge production actually expands the economy.
Take archaeological digs, for instance, and their impact on tourism.
Our desires to unearth our antiquity, especially those remote times of which we have no written records, requires investment in archaeology and related disciplines, e.g., paleoanthropology.
Yet, although it is our past we seek to know, by sheer serendipity, archaeology may shed light on the global human experience and yield economic payoffs that were no part of the original reasons for digging.
We must find a way to make knowledge and its production sexy and rewarding; rewarding, not in the crass sense of moneymaking but in terms of making it worthwhile to indulge in the pursuit of knowledge, support the existence of knowledge-producing groups and intellectuals, ensuring that the continent becomes the immediate locus of knowledge production, distribution and consumption, and that instead of having its depositories beyond Africa's boundaries, people once more come from the rest of the world, even if in virtual space, to learn from us.
All this we do as custodians on behalf of common humanity.
Creating a knowledge society in Africa, for me, would be one way to celebrate and simultaneously enhance diversity by infinitely enriching it with material and additional artifacts — artifacts that we furnish by our strivings in the knowledge field.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
We humans are becoming an urban species, so cities, they are our natural habitat.
That is where we live.
In 2014, over 54 percent of the world population was living in cities, and I can bet you that so many of these people have thought of how they would do things differently, like if I only had the tools to change things in my city, what would I do? What would my dream city be like? And these tools, this is just what we gave them.
Two years ago, my team and I, we released a game, "Cities: Skylines." It is a game about building cities.
So I have always been interested in cities as systems.
It's something that I find immensely interesting.
But what I didn't understand was that I am not alone in this. People love cities. They are interested. They have ideas. The game was an instant hit.
So far, over three and a half million people have played it.
And it's not just about playing.
We also have really awesome sharing systems.
So people play, they create cities and then they are sharing these creations, showing off what they have made.
And what I will show you is some of these cities created by the players.
So the game is about self-expression, creativity, not just overcoming the challenges posed by the simulation.
It is about showing what your cities look like.
So I have a couple of videos. These are from YouTube.
And these are some of the most interesting city designs I have seen.
So they are all different, and I hope you like all of these.
This one is called The Netherlands. It's by Silvarret. And when you start the game, you have an empty piece of land.
This land, it can be based on the real world, it can be hand-crafted in the map editor, or you can, of course, download a city made by someone else and play in that.
But what Silvarret has done here is that what he wanted to make was not a real city.
This is a fantasy city, even though it looks real.
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city that could be in the Netherlands.
So he kind of investigated what are the characteristics of cities in the Netherlands and combined a couple of those, and this is what he created.
So it is a city, but it is not a real city, but it could be.
It looks just like the Netherlands.
So the places are really densely populated.
So what you need is highways, trains, anything connecting these small town centers together.
Lots of people, lots of moving, so transportation is the key here.
But then let's go even more on the fantasy side.
Let's go into the future.
This is one of my personal favorites.
These city designs are what I love the most.
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd, and the basic idea is that you have concentric circle routes.
So the city is a big circle with tinier circles inside.
And the thing is that you put all of the services in the center, and then people actually live on the outer ring, because there is less traffic, less noise, less pollution, so that is where you want to live.
But the services are still really close by.
They are in the center.
And this is the soul of the game.
The player has to understand what are the wishes, what are the needs of the tiny people living in the cities.
So you need to know where you should put the things.
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.
It needs to be accessible.
Citizens need to reach the hospital.
And this is one way to do it.
So maybe this is something that we might be seeing someday.
And then even more into the future. Astergea by Yuttho. So Yuttho does YouTube videos and plays the game.
What he did here was actually a 12-point series of creating this city.
So what he does is he plays the game, he records it and he explains as he's going what he's doing and why.
And as a part of this series, he actually did an interview with an actual urban planner called Jeff Speck.
And Speck is an expert on the concept of walkability.
The basic idea is that if you want your citizens to walk, which is kind of beneficial, you actually need to have walking as a reasonable means of transportation.
It should be a good way to reach places.
So what Yuttho did was that he explained this concept, he had Speck explain it, too, and then he applied it to the city that he was building.
So what we are seeing is Yuttho's vision of the future: lots of public transportation, walkways, plazas, connecting high-rise buildings.
Maybe this is what the future might look like.
And the game system works really well for this.
We are seeing some real-world uses to this game.
So we know that some urban planners are using it as a sketching tool, so while the simulation is not completely realistic, it is realistic enough that if something works in the game, it is highly likely that it will also work in the real world, so that you can actually try out things, see if this intersection might fit this kind of a situation.
If we build a new road, would it help?
And this is what you can do with this game.
There was one really interesting contest held by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.
So what they did was that they had a new area that they wanted to develop in the city.
They made a map with the existing city, they left empty the area that they would want to develop and shared this map.
So anyone could download the map, play the game, build the area and submit their creations to the city council.
So they have not yet built anything, but it might just be that they use one of these plans made with the game to actually build the real city.
And these videos that I have shown you, these are the people who are coming up with new kinds of solutions.
We know that cities are growing.
They're getting bigger as we go, and the percentage of population living in cities is projected to rise.
So we need the solutions and these people, playing the game, they are trying out different kinds of solutions.
They might have something that is really important.
So what we are seeing here is dream cities that might be real one day.
So it might be that this is not just a game.
It might be a way to decide our own fate.
Thank you. (Applause)
Today I want to confess something to you, but first of all I'm going to ask you a couple of questions.
How many people here have children?
And how many of you are confident that you know how to bring up your children in exactly the right way?
(Laughter)
OK, I don't see too many hands going up on that second one, and that's my confession, too.
I've got three boys; they're three, nine and 12.
And like you, and like most parents, the honest truth is I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing.
I want them to be happy and healthy in their lives, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do to make sure they are happy and healthy.
There's so many books offering all kinds of conflicting advice, it can be really overwhelming.
So I've spent most of their lives just making it up as I go along.
However, something changed me a few years ago, when I came across a little secret that we have in Britain.
It's helped me become more confident about how I bring up my own children, and it's revealed a lot about how we as a society can help all children.
I want to share that secret with you today.
For the last 70 years, scientists in Britain have been following thousands of children through their lives as part of an incredible scientific study.
There's nothing quite like it anywhere else in the world.
Collecting information on thousands of children is a really powerful thing to do, because it means we can compare the ones who say, do well at school or end up healthy or happy or wealthy as adults, and the ones who struggle much more, and then we can sift through all the information we've collected and try to work out why their lives turned out different.
This British study -- it's actually a kind of crazy story.
So it all starts back in 1946, just a few months after the end of the war, when scientists wanted to know what it was like for a woman to have a baby at the time.
They carried out this huge survey of mothers and ended up recording the birth of nearly every baby born in England, Scotland and Wales in one week.
That was nearly 14,000 babies.
The questions they asked these women are very different than the ones we might ask today.
They sound really old-fashioned now.
They asked them things like, "During pregnancy, did you get your full extra ration of a pint of milk a day?" "How much did you spend on smocks, corsets, nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?" And this is my favorite one: "Who looked after your husband while you were in bed with this baby?"
(Laughter)
Now, this wartime study actually ended up being so successful that scientists did it again.
They recorded the births of thousands of babies born in 1958 and thousands more in 1970.
They did it again in the early 1990s, and again at the turn of the millennium.
Altogether, more than 70,000 children have been involved in these studies across those five generations.
They're called the British birth cohorts, and scientists have gone back and recorded more information on all of these people every few years ever since.
The amount of information that's now been collected on these people is just completely mind-boggling.
It includes thousands of paper questionnaires and terabytes' worth of computer data.
Scientists have also built up a huge bank of tissue samples, which includes locks of hair, nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.
They've even collected 9,000 placentas from some of the births, which are now pickled in plastic buckets in a secure storage warehouse.
This whole project has become unique -- so, no other country in the world is tracking generations of children in quite this detail.
These are some of the best-studied people on the planet, and the data has become incredibly valuable for scientists, generating well over 6,000 academic papers and books.
But today I want to focus on just one finding -- perhaps the most important discovery to come from this remarkable study.
And it's also the one that spoke to me personally, because it's about how to use science to do the best for our children.
So, let's get the bad news out of the way first.
Perhaps the biggest message from this remarkable study is this: don't be born into poverty or into disadvantage, because if you are, you're far more likely to walk a difficult path in life.
Many children in this study were born into poor families or into working-class families that had cramped homes or other problems, and it's clear now that those disadvantaged children have been more likely to struggle on almost every score.
They've been more likely to do worse at school, to end up with worse jobs and to earn less money.
Now, maybe that sounds really obvious, but some of the results have been really surprising, so children who had a tough start in life are also more likely to end up unhealthy as adults.
They're more likely to be overweight, to have high blood pressure, and then decades down the line, more likely to have a failing memory, poor health and even to die earlier.
Now, I talked about what happens later, but some of these differences emerge at a really shockingly early age.
In one study, children who were growing up in poverty were almost a year behind the richer children on educational tests, and that was by the age of just three.
These types of differences have been found again and again across the generations.
It means that our early circumstances have a profound influence on the way that the rest of our lives play out.
And working out why that is is one of the most difficult questions that we face today. So there we have it.
The first lesson for successful life, everyone, is this: choose your parents very carefully.
(Laughter)
Don't be born into a poor family or into a struggling family.
Now, I'm sure you can see the small problem here.
We can't choose our parents or how much they earn, but this British study has also struck a real note of optimism by showing that not everyone who has a disadvantaged start ends up in difficult circumstances.
As you know, many people have a tough start in life, but they end up doing very well on some measure nevertheless, and this study starts to explain how.
So the second lesson is this: parents really matter.
In this study, children who had engaged, interested parents, ones who had ambition for their future, were more likely to escape from a difficult start.
It seems that parents and what they do are really, really important, especially in the first few years of life.
Let me give you an example of that.
In one study, scientists looked at about 17,000 children who were born in 1970.
They sifted all the mountains of data that they had collected to try to work out what allowed the children who'd had a difficult start in life to go on and do well at school nevertheless.
In other words, which ones beat the odds.
The data showed that what mattered more than anything else was parents.
Having engaged, interested parents in those first few years of life was strongly linked to children going on to do well at school later on.
In fact, quite small things that parents do are associated with good outcomes for children.
Talking and listening to a child, responding to them warmly, teaching them their letters and numbers, taking them on trips and visits.
Reading to children every day seems to be really important, too.
So in one study, children whose parents were reading to them daily when they were five and then showing an interest in their education at the age of 10, were significantly less likely to be in poverty at the age of 30 than those whose parents weren't doing those things.
Now, there are huge challenges with interpreting this type of science.
These studies show that certain things that parents do are correlated with good outcomes for children, but we don't necessarily know those behaviors caused the good outcomes, or whether some other factor is getting in the way.
For example, we have to take genes into account, and that's a whole other talk in itself.
But scientists working with this British study are working really hard to get at causes, and this is one study I particularly love.
In this one, they looked at the bedtime routines of about 10,000 children born at the turn of the millennium.
Were the children going to bed at regular times, or did they go to bed at different times during the week?
The data showed that those children who were going to bed at different times were more likely to have behavioral problems, and then those that switched to having regular bedtimes often showed an improvement in behavior, and that was really crucial, because it suggested it was the bedtime routines that were really helping things get better for those kids.
Here's another one to think about.
In this one, scientists looked at children who were reading for pleasure.
That means that they picked up a magazine, a picture book, a story book.
The data showed that children who were reading for pleasure at the ages of five and 10 were more likely to go on in school better, on average, on school tests later in their lives.
And not just tests of reading, but tests of spelling and maths as well.
This study tried to control for all the confounding factors, so it looked at children who were equally intelligent and from the same social-class background, so it seemed as if it was the reading which really helped those children go on and score better on those school tests later in their lives.
Now at the start, I said the first lesson from this study was not to be born into poverty or into disadvantage, because those children tend to follow more difficult paths in their lives.
But then I said that parenting matters, and that good parenting, if you can call it that, helps children beat the odds and overcome some of those early disadvantages.
So wait, does that actually mean, then, that poverty doesn't matter after all?
You could argue it doesn't matter if a child is born poor -- as long as their parents are good parents, they're going to do just fine.
I don't believe that's true.
This study shows that poverty and parenting matter.
And one study actually put figures on that, so it looked at children growing up in persistent poverty and how well they were doing at school.
The data showed that even when their parents were doing everything right -- putting them to bed on time and reading to them every day and everything else -- that only got those children so far.
Good parenting only reduced the educational gap between the rich and poor children by about 50 percent.
Now that means that poverty leaves a really lasting scar, and it means that if we really want to ensure the success and well-being of the next generation, then tackling child poverty is an incredibly important thing to do.
Now, what does all this mean for you and me?
Are there lessons here we can all take home and use?
As a scientist and a journalist, I like to have some science to inform my parenting ... and I can tell you that when you're shouting at your kids to go to bed on time, it really helps to have the scientific literature on your side.
(Laughter)
And wouldn't it be great to think that all we had to do to have happy, successful children was to talk to them, be interested in their future, put them to bed on time, and give them a book to read?
Our job would be done.
Now, as you can imagine, the answers aren't quite as simple as that.
For one thing, this study looks at what happens to thousands and thousands of children on average, but that doesn't necessarily say what will help my child or your child or any individual child.
In the end, each of our children is going to walk their own path, and that's partly defined by the genes they inherit and of course all the experiences they have through their lives, including their interactions with us, their parents.
I will tell you what I did after I learned all this.
It's a bit embarrassing.
I realized I was so busy working, and ironically, learning and writing about this incredible study of British children, that there were days when I hardly even spoke to my own British children.
So at home, we introduced talking time, which is just 15 minutes at the end of the day when we talk and listen to the boys.
I try better now to ask them what they did today, and to show that I value what they do at school.
Of course, I make sure they always have a book to read.
I tell them I'm ambitious for their future, and I think they can be happy and do great things.
I don't know that any of that will make a difference, but I'm pretty confident it won't do them any harm, and it might even do them some good.
Ultimately, if we want happy children, all we can do is listen to the science, and of course, listen to our children themselves.
Thank you.
We live in a time of fear, and our response to fear can either be to contract and attempt to guard ourselves or to extend ourselves, hold on to each other, and face our fears together.
What is your instinct?
What do you see more of in the world?
The problem with the first approach is that in our mounting isolation, we divide ourselves from others.
Our sense of isolation grows, because our imagination goes into overdrive about the people and the spaces that we no longer engage with.
Our sense of otherness grows, and we lose empathy.
Today I'm going to tell you about a group of people that took the global challenge of terrorism and began creating spaces where strangers connect in solidarity.
My own obsession with what I see as irrational divisions began as a child.
As a fourth-generation Kenyan Muslim of Indian origin, it bothered me that in four generations, there wasn't a single marriage in my family outside of my small religious community.
And I wondered what that was about. Was it fear? Was it racism? Was it cultural preservation?
Did it have something to do with colonialism?
Certainly, we didn't share a lot of the same public spaces with others.
These divisions bothered me deeply, and they drove my career choices.
When I was 20, the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.
A year later, I was on my way to the Middle East to study conflict resolution.
And then from that point on, it wasn't very hard for me to find insecure environments to work in, because the world was quickly shifting in what we now know as the time of terrorism.
I was in Washington, DC when 9 / 11 happened, and then I moved back home to Kenya to work with refugees and then later worked in Pakistan and in Afghanistan.
In all of these places, what I noticed was how important physical spaces are to making us feel safe and well and like we belong.
In 2013, I came back home to Nairobi from Afghanistan. Al-Shabaab operatives had besieged Westgate shopping center, killing 67 people in a day of utter horror.
Soon after that, I could see how Nairobi was beginning to change, and it was beginning to feel more like the fear and terror-weary and war-torn cities that I had worked in.
And Nairobi continues to grow in fear-driven ways.
We see more walls, more barriers, more security.
And like other parts of the world, we are experiencing an erosion of human connection.
Divisions along religious lines are deepening, and we're doubting more and more how much we have in common.
We are at a pivotal time when we need to restore our confidence in humanity and stand boldly and visibly together.
So in 2014, I brought together a group of people in Nairobi to figure out what to do: public intellectuals, diplomats, artists, development workers.
And the group articulated our challenge as threefold: one, to reclaim the city from the narrative of terrorism and back into the hands of the people that live there; two, introduce a language beyond race, tribe or religion that would help us transcend our differences; and three, provide a gesture that would help restore empathy and conversation and trust.
One of the people in this group was an artist and architect, Yazmany Arboleda.
He and I have collaborated in other parts of the world over many years.
He has a history of disrupting urban environments and making strangers connect in incredible, beautiful and spectacular ways.
He had an idea.
The idea was to unite people of different faiths by getting them to paint each other's houses of worship, mosques, temples, synagogues, churches, paint them yellow in the name of love.
By focusing on icons of faith, we would get people to reexamine the true essence of their faith, the common belief that we share in kindness, generosity and friendship.
By creating pathways between houses of worship within one neighborhood, we would create islands of stability and networks of people that could withstand threats.
And neighbors, by picking up a paintbrush with other neighbors, would engage not just with their heads but with their hands and with their hearts.
And the painted buildings would become sculptures in the landscape that speak of people from very different backgrounds that stand together.
We'd call the project "Colour in Faith." We loved the idea and we immediately began approaching houses of worship: churches, temples, mosques, synagogues.
Door to door, we went to more than 60 rabbis, imams, pastors and priests.
As you can imagine, bringing these communities together when prejudices are reinforced by a global pandemic of fear is not easy. It was complicated. We were confronted with the hierarchy of decision-making within religious establishments.
For example, with Catholic churches, we were told that the archbishop would have to make the decision.
And so we wrote a letter to the archbishop.
We wrote a letter to the Vatican.
We're still waiting to hear back.
(Laughter)
And with other houses of worship, we were told that the patrons, the people that pay for the building and the construction and the painting of the buildings would have to make a decision.
And then we came head-to-head with the long legacy of missionary and donor dependence that so impedes unconditional civic action, and we learned this the hard way.
There was one community that in our repeated conversations would keep asking us to appreciate them.
And so we would keep going back and telling them that we appreciate them, and of course, if we didn't appreciate them, we wouldn't be here.
And then we learned painfully late in the game that the word "appreciation" is code for getting paid to participate.
And so we challenged them and we asked the question, "So what will it cost?
How much could we pay you?
And if we pay for your faith, is it really faith?" We started the project asking the question, "Where does your faith live?" And here we found ourselves asking the question, "How much does your faith cost?"
But the most difficult issue was the perceived risk of standing apart.
We had one synagogue that flat-out refused to participate because it feared drawing attention to itself and becoming a target.
Similarly, we had a mosque that also feared becoming a target.
And these fears are justified.
And yet, there were 25 houses of worship that pledged to participate.
(Applause)
These bold leaders took the gesture and reinforced it with their own meaning.
For some, it was to tell the world that they're not terrorists.
For others, it was to welcome people through their doors to ask questions.
And for some, it was to bridge the gap between the older and the younger generation, which by the way is something that many faiths are grappling with right now.
And for some it was simply to build neighborhood solidarity in advance of feared election violence.
When asked why yellow, one imam beautifully said, "Yellow is the color of the sun.
The sun shines on us all equally.
It does not discriminate." He and others spread the word through their congregations and over the radio.
Municipal government officials stepped forward and helped with permits and with convening civil society organizations.
A paint company donated a thousand liters of yellow paint mixed especially for us in what they now call "optimistic yellow."
(Laughter)
And a poetry collective joined forces with a university and hosted a series of tweet chats that challenged the nation on issues of faith, our faith not just in the context of religion, but our faith in politicians and tribe and nation, our faith in the older generation and in the younger generation.
And then Colour in Faith was launched at a gallery event that invited an incredible mix of gallerygoers and religious leaders and artists and businesspeople.
Already, even before picking up a paintbrush, we had accomplished so much of the conversation and connection that we had hoped for.
And then we began to paint.
Muslims stood by Christians and atheists and agnostics and Hindus and painted a mosque yellow.
And then they all came together again and painted a church yellow, and then another mosque, and then another church.
Poets and musicians performed while we painted.
We painted in Nairobi, and then we painted in Mombasa.
The local and international press did features on Colour in Faith in English and French and Swahili and Spanish and Somali.
CNN highlighted Colour in Faith as a way of bringing communities together.
And our social media platforms lit up, connecting more and more people.
And these neighbors continued to stay in touch.
There are some that are pursuing politics with a platform of peace, and we have communities as far as Argentina and the US and as close as Mali and Rwanda that are asking for our help.
And we would love to help.
It's our dream that this project, this idea, spreads across the world, with or without our support.
Colour in Faith is literally highlighting those who mean well in yellow. Colour in Faith is binding neighborhoods together, and it's our hope that when threats come knocking, they will collectively sift fact from rumor and stand in solidarity.
We've proven that the human family can come together and send a message far brighter and more powerful than the voices of those that wish to do us harm.
Though fear is infectious, we are showing that so is hope.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, I had been a photographer for 18 years before I began the Microsculpture Project.
And in that time, I had shot global ad campaigns, I had the opportunity to photograph some of my generation's icons, and I was traveling the world.
I got to a point in my career that I dreamed of getting to, and yet, for some reason, I still felt a little bit unfulfilled.
Despite the extraordinary things I was shooting and experiencing, they'd started to feel a little bit ordinary to me.
I was also getting concerned about how disposable photography had started to feel in the digital world, and I really wanted to produce images that had a sense of worth again.
And I needed a subject that felt extraordinary.
Sometimes I wish I had the eyes of a child.
And by that I mean, I wish I could look at the world in the same as I did when I was a small boy.
I think there is a danger, as we get older, that our curiosity becomes slightly muted or dulled by familiarity.
And as a visual creator, one of the challenges for me is to present the familiar in a new and engaging way.
Fortunately for me, though, I've got two great kids who are still curious about the world.
Sebastian -- he's still curious about the world, and in 2014, in spring, he brought in a ground beetle from the garden.
There was nothing particularly special about this insect -- you know, it was a common species.
But he was still curious, and he brought it up to my office, and we decided to look at it under his microscope.
He had a little science kit for Christmas.
And this is what we saw.
Now, when I first saw this, it blew me away.
Up here -- this is the back of the ground beetle.
When I first saw it, it reminded me of a galaxy.
And all the time, this had just been outside our window.
You know, I was looking for this extraordinary subject, and it took Seb's eyes and curiosity to bring it in to me.
So I decided to photograph it for him, and this is what I produced.
I basically asked myself two simple questions.
The first one: Could I take all my knowledge and skill of photographic lighting and take that onto a subject that's five millimeters long?
But also: Could I keep creative control over that lighting on a subject that size?
So I practiced on some other found specimens, and I approached the Oxford University Museum of Natural History to see if I could have access to their collection, to progress the project.
And I went up there for a meeting, and I showed them some of the images that I'd been shooting, and they could see the kind of detail I was able to get.
I don't think they'd ever really seen anything quite like it before, and from that point forward, they gave me open access to their entire collection and the assistance of Dr. James Hogan, their entomologist.
Now, over the next two-and-a-half years, I shot 37 insects from their collection.
And the way I work is that I essentially split the insect up into multiple sections, and I treat each one of those sections like a small still life.
So for example, if I was photographing the eye of the insect, which is normally quite smooth and dome-shaped, then I'd use a light source that is large and soft and diffuse, so I don't get any harsh hot spots on that surface.
But once my attention turns over to a hairy leg, that lighting setup will change completely.
And so I make that one tiny section look as beautiful as I possibly can, and I work my way across the insect until I have about 20 or 25 different sections.
The issue with photography at high magnification is that there is inherently a very shallow depth of field.
So to get around that, what I do is, I put my camera on a rail that I can automate to move 10 microns in between each shot.
That's about one-seventh the width of a human hair.
And then that provides me with a deep stack of images.
Each has a tiny sliver of focus all the way through.
And I can squash that down to produce one image that is fully focused from front to back.
So essentially, that gives me 25 sections that are fully focused and beautifully lit.
Now, each one of my images is made up of anywhere between 8- and 10,000 separate shots.
They take about three-and-a-half weeks to create, and the file sizes on average are about four gigabytes.
So I've got plenty of information to play with when I'm printing.
And the prints at the exhibition are around the three-meter mark.
In fact, I had a show in Milan two weeks ago, and we had some prints there that were nine meters long.
But, you know, I realize that these images still have to work in the digital world.
There's no point in me putting all my blood, sweat and tears into these pictures if they're only going to be showing 500 pixels on a screen.
So with the help of Rob Chandler and Will Cookson, we developed a website that enables the viewer to immerse themselves into the full four-gigabyte files, and they can explore all that microscopic detail.
So if you have the time, and I encourage you, please visit microsculpture.net and go and have a play.
It's good fun.
I first showed the work at Oxford, and since then, it's moved on to the Middle East.
It's now back in Europe and goes to Copenhagen this month.
And the feedback has been great.
You know, I get emails, actually, from all over the world -- from teachers, at the moment, who are using the website in school.
The kids are using them on the tablet.
They're zooming into the pictures and using it for art class, biology class.
And that's not something I planned.
That's just a beautiful offshoot of the project.
In fact, one of the things I like to do at the exhibitions is actually look at the kiddies' reactions.
And, you know, standing in front of a three-meter insect, they could have been horrified.
But they're not. They look in wonder.
This little chap here, he stood there for five minutes, motionless.
(Laughter)
And at the end of the day, actually, at the end of the day at the exhibitions, we have to wipe down the lower third of the big prints — (Laughter) just to remove all those sticky handprints, because all they want to do is touch those big bugs.
I do want to leave you with one final image, if that's OK.
This has to do with Charles Darwin.
One of the recent images that I photographed was this one here.
I'm talking about the creature in the box, not my cat.
And this is a shield bug that Charles Darwin brought back from Australia on the HMS Beagle in 1836.
And when I got it home, I stood in my kitchen and stared at it for about 20 minutes.
I couldn't believe I was in possession of this beautiful creature.
And at that moment, I kind of realized that this validated the project for me.
The fact that the museum was willing to risk me playing with this kind of showed me that my images had worth -- you know, they weren't disposable.
That's the image that I produced.
I often wonder, still, when I look at this: What would Charles Darwin make of these images?
Do you think he'd like his picture of his shield bug? I hope so.
So --
(Applause)
You know, I think it's strange in a way.
I'm a visual person, I'm a creative person, but I still needed the eyes of a child to find my extraordinary subject.
That's the way it was.
So all I can say is, thank you very much, Sebastian; I am very, very grateful.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I took a cell phone and accidentally made myself famous.
(Laughter)
I was just talking about the things that I cared about, but with the click of a button and an incendiary viral video I propelled myself into overnight stardom.
When I say overnight, I mean I literally woke up the next morning with so many notifications on my phone, I thought I slept through a national tragedy.
(Laughter)
It was the craziest thing, guys, but when it came to my influence and my exposure, I literally took a quantum leap.
So I made more videos and the subject matter of my videos was often the most divisive subject in American life, but it was the way that I articulated race that made me somewhat of a digital lightning rod.
See, being a survivor myself of police brutality and having lost a childhood friend, Alonzo Ashley, at the hands of the police, I had a little something to say about the topic.
You see, this was at the height of the Black Lives Matter furor and people seemed to be turning to me to articulate their viewpoints, and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming.
You see, the internet has this interesting quality.
In one way, it totally brought the world together, and I remember being a kid and all of this utopian propaganda was being dumped on us about how the World Wide Web was going to span the reaches of people across the globe.
But as it turns out, people are people.
(Laughter)
And this magical superhighway also took the demons of our nature and gave them Ferraris.
(Laughter)
You see, technology, y'all, is a lot like money.
It just brings out what's already inside you and amplifies it.
And so I soon became familiar with the phenomenon of the internet troll.
These guys seem to live beneath the bridges of said superhighway --
(Laughter)
And they also missed the memo about the enlightenment of the internet age.
I remember being called highly colorful racial slurs by those who use the anonymity of the internet as a Klan hood.
And some of them were pretty creative, actually, but others were pretty wounding, especially navigating the post-traumatic world of a police brutality survivor in the height of Black Lives Matter, with all of these people being killed on my timeline.
To these trolls, I wasn't a human.
I was an idea, an object, a caricature.
Did I mention that this race stuff can be kind of divisive?
You see, I'm an innately curious person and as I drew my sword to engage in epic battles in the comment section --
(Laughter)
I also began to notice that a few of my trolls actually had brains, which made me even more curious and what to understand them even further.
And although these supposed morons engaged in what appeared to be original thought, I said to myself, "Um, these guys are highly misinformed, at least according to my knowledge." Where are these guys getting these arguments from?
Like, was there some kind of alternative universe with alternative facts?
(Laughter)
Was history and gravity optional over there?
I don't know.
But I needed to know. Like, I wanted to know. And as it turns out, I had no idea about digital echo chambers.
That same target marketing algorithm that feeds you more of the products you like to buy also feeds you more of the news that you like to hear.
I had been living in an online universe that just reflected my worldview back to me.
So my timeline was pretty liberal.
I had no Breitbart or Infowars or Fox News.
No, no, I was all MSNBC and The Daily Show, CNN and theGrio, right?
Well, these trolls were hopping the dimensional doorway and I needed to figure out how.
(Laughter)
So what I decided to do was trick the Facebook algorithm into feeding me more news that I didn't necessarily agree with, and this worked fine for a while, but it wasn't enough, because my online footprint already established the patterns that I like to hear.
So with the anonymity of the internet, I went undercover.
(Laughter)
I set up this ghost profile and went crazy.
Now, on a practical level, it was very simple, but on an emotional level, it was kind of daunting, especially with the racist vitriol that I had experienced.
But what I didn't realize is that my trolls were inoculating me, thickening my skin, making me immune to viewpoints that I didn't necessarily agree with, and so I didn't react to the same things as I would have several months prior. All right? So I pressed on.
Noticing that this stuff also worked on YouTube, I became Lucius25, white supremacist lurker --
(Laughter)
And digitally I began to infiltrate the infamous alt-right movement.
Now, my doppelgänger was Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter character --
(Laughter)
a sci-fi hero who was once a Confederate soldier.
And to think, like, years ago, I would have needed acting training and, like, makeup and a fake ID.
Now I could just lurk.
And so I started with a little Infowars, went on into some American Renaissance, National Vanguard Alliance, and, you know, I started commenting on videos, talking bad about Al Sharpton and Black Lives Matter.
I started bemoaning race baiters like Eric Holder and Barack Obama and just mirroring the antiblack sentiments that were thrown at me.
And to be honest, it was kind of exhilarating.
(Laughter)
Like, I would literally spend days clicking through my new racist profile --
(Laughter)
Goofing off at work in Aryan land.
It was something else.
And so I then started visiting some of the pages of my former trolls, and a lot of these guys were just regular Joes, a lot of outdoorsmen, hunters, computer nerds, some of them family guys with videos of their families.
I mean, for all I know, some of y'all could be in this room right now. Right?
(Laughter)
But when I went undercover, I found a lovely plethora of characters, luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos, Richard Spencer and David Duke.
All of these guys were thought leaders in their own right, but over time, the alt-right movement ended up using their information to fuel their momentum.
And I'm going to tell you what else led to the momentum of the alt-right: the left wing's wholesale demonization of everything white and male.
If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver, you're in league with Satan.
(Laughter)
Now, would you believe, would you believe that some people find that offensive? And —
(Laughter)
And so, I mean, listen, the fact is that millennials get a lifetime of diet brand history.
I mean, America seems to be hellbent on filling its textbooks with CliffsNotes versions of its dark past.
This severely, severely decontextualizes race and the anger associated with it, and that is fertile ground for alt-facts to grow.
Add in the wild landscape of the internet and it's easy to sell rebranded "Mein Kampf" ideas to a generation who has been failed by public schools.
A lot of these ideas, easily debunked.
Alt-facts have that quality.
However, one theme kept screaming at me through the subtext of those arguments, and that was, why should I be hated for who I cannot help but be?
Now, as a black man in America, that resonated with me.
I have spent so much time defending myself against attempts to demonize me and make me apologize for who I am, trying to portray me as something that I'm not, some kind of thug or gangster, a menace to society. Unexpected compassion. Wow. Now, listen, the historical source of the demonization of black males and white males is highly different, and where you fall on this argument, sadly, tends to be an accident of birth.
Now, you're probably surprised by this perspective, and so was I. Never in a billion years did I think that I could have some kind of compassion for people who hated my guts.
Now, mind you, not enough compassion like I want to be friends.
I don't have infinite olive branches to extend to people who, like, would not want to see me on this planet. Right? But just enough compassion to understand how they got to where they are.
And to be honest, there were a couple of fair points.
One of them was how liberals have this wide acceptance for everybody except for those with honestly held conservative viewpoints.
(Laughter)
Heaven forbid you love God, this country and mean it. Right?
And another thing that they talked about was this fear that they had of something that they labeled as "white genocide," that diversity would be a force that would wipe them out.
Now listen, I know what it is to fear for the fate of your people.
Between crack, AIDS, gang violence, mass incarceration, gentrification, police shootings, black people have more than enough reasons to stay up at night.
But if nature is into diversity and you are not, you're going to lose that fight, buddy.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You see, nature doesn't care about your race. That's man-made. Nature just cares about healthy organisms, and your precious ethnic features are expendable to that aim.
So the moment that you let go of that racist identity and relatch onto humanity, all your problems go away.
(Applause)
I'm going to tell you what race ain't about to die out: the human race. Join the party. The water's great.
(Laughter) Until the water gets too hot, but that's another TED Talk.
The point is that to get to this point of understanding, you have to let go of that fear and embrace your curiosity, and sadly, too many people will not take that journey to see the world from the other side.
And, I mean, let's be honest, that doesn't just go for progressives, but also to the right wing and conservatives.
You know, as fair as some of their points were, they were still trapped in their own echo chambers, recycling old, outdated points of view, never getting a diversity in perspective, not making them well-rounded in their worldview.
So they're not hearing certain anti-racist and political voices, voices like Tim Wise and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy, Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed.
All of these voices have the answers to the questions that they want, but unfortunately they will not hear them due to the power of these echo chambers.
We have got to break out of these digital divides, because as our technology advances, the consequences of our tribalism become more dangerous.
And this whole experience taught me something: our gadgets ain't going to save us.
All these technological devices are only mastery of the universe out there, not the one in here.
And so that's all IQ, not EQ.
That's a dangerous imbalance.
Where do you get the emotional intelligence, the character development, the virtues of patience, forbearance, compassion, you know, the things that make sure that these devices, however advanced, become a blessing and not a curse?
Seems to be me that humanity itself needs an upgrade.
Now --
(Applause)
That's a big task, understandably, but I don't believe in any kind of unbeatable monster.
There was no giant out there without perhaps a simple Achilles heel.
And what if I told you that one of the best ways to actually overcome this is to have courageous conversations with difficult people, people who do not see the world the same way that you see the world?
Oh yes, folks, conversations may be indeed the key to that upgrade, because remember, language was the first form of virtual reality.
It is literally a symbolic representation of the physical world, and through this device, we change the physical world.
Keep in mind, conversations stop violence, conversations start countries, they build bridges, and when the chips are down, conversations are the last tools that humans use before they pick up their guns.
And I ain't talking about online safe conversations from the security of your laptop. No. I'm talking about in-your-face conversations with real, breathing people.
And for me, this looks like running a community forum called Shop Talk Live.
Now, in Shop Talk Live -- somebody's been there, right?
In Shop Talk Live, we have the conversations that change lives.
We meet the community right where they are, and we've done everything from divert gang violence in real time to help find people jobs to mentoring homeless youth.
And the reason why we needed to do this is because there was a severe lack of trust in the black community due to the violence of the crack era.
And so we ended up taking agency into our own hands, solving our own problems, not waiting for anybody else.
And the truth is, from the mayor to the felon, you're going to find them in that barber shop.
And so what we did was just organize what was already going on.
And so what I started doing was mining these alternative viewpoints from these alternative digital universes, dissecting them, breaking them down into controversial talking points.
Then, with my cell phone, I flipped the internet against itself and began to broadcast these live conversations to my online followers.
This made them want to leave the safety of their laptops and meet us in person to have real conversations with real people in real life.
And we did this. Thank you.
(Applause)
Sometimes I sit back, and I reflect on the paradox of me just trying to solve the problems, us trying to solve the problems in our own communities -- we build bridges to so many other communities, from the LGBTQ community to the Arab immigrant community and even sat down with somebody with a Confederate flag on their hat and talked about the things that actually matter.
It is time that we stop trying to hack our way around the human experience.
There is no way out of each other. Stop trying to find one.
(Applause)
We have to understand something. Human beings all want the same things and we have to go through each other to get these things.
These courageous conversations are the way that these bridges are built.
It's time that we start seeing people as people and not simply the ideas that we project onto them or react to.
Human beings are not the barriers but the gateways to the very things that we want.
This is a collective and conscious evolution.
My journey began with a terribly popular cell phone video and a fallen friend.
Your journey begins right about now.
Join the renaissance in human connection.
It is going to happen with or without you.
My suggestion: pick a topic, and start a community dialogue in your neck of the woods.
Meet folks back in real life.
And I'm going to tell you, when you trick the algorithm of your existence, you will get some diversified experiences.
It is time to grow, people.
And when we do this, not if, it will be clear that the key to this upgrade was always our inner world, not some device that we create, and the doorways to this experience is now, and will forever be, each other.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What are you doing on this stage in front of all these people?
(Laughter)
Run!
(Laughter)
Run now.
That's the voice of my anxiety talking.
Even when there's absolutely nothing wrong, I sometimes get this overwhelming sense of doom, like danger is lurking just around the corner.
You see, a few years ago, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression -- two conditions that often go hand in hand.
Now, there was a time I wouldn't have told anybody, especially not in front of a big audience.
As a black woman, I've had to develop extraordinary resilience to succeed.
And like most people in my community, I had the misconception that depression was a sign of weakness, a character flaw.
But I wasn't weak; I was a high achiever.
I'd earned a Master's degree in Media Studies and had a string of high-profile jobs in the film and television industries.
I'd even won two Emmy Awards for my hard work.
Sure, I was totally spent, I lacked interest in things I used to enjoy, barely ate, struggled with insomnia and felt isolated and depleted. But depressed? No, not me.
It took weeks before I could admit it, but the doctor was right: I was depressed.
Still, I didn't tell anybody about my diagnosis.
I was too ashamed.
I didn't think I had the right to be depressed.
I had a privileged life with a loving family and a successful career.
And when I thought about the unspeakable horrors that my ancestors had been through in this country so that I could have it better, my shame grew even deeper.
I was standing on their shoulders.
How could I let them down?
I would hold my head up, put a smile on my face and never tell a soul.
On July 4, 2013, my world came crashing in on me.
That was the day I got a phone call from my mom telling me that my 22-year-old nephew, Paul, had ended his life, after years of battling depression and anxiety.
There are no words that can describe the devastation I felt.
Paul and I were very close, but I had no idea he was in so much pain.
Neither one of us had ever talked to the other about our struggles.
The shame and stigma kept us both silent.
Now, my way of dealing with adversity is to face it head on, so I spent the next two years researching depression and anxiety, and what I found was mind-blowing.
The World Health Organization reports that depression is the leading cause of sickness and disability in the world.
While the exact cause of depression isn't clear, research suggests that most mental disorders develop, at least in part, because of a chemical imbalance in the brain, and / or an underlying genetic predisposition.
So you can't just shake it off.
For black Americans, stressors like racism and socioeconomic disparities put them at a 20 percent greater risk of developing a mental disorder, yet they seek mental health services at about half the rate of white Americans.
One reason is the stigma, with 63 percent of black Americans mistaking depression for a weakness.
Sadly, the suicide rate among black children has doubled in the past 20 years.
Now, here's the good news: seventy percent of people struggling with depression will improve with therapy, treatment and medication.
Armed with this information, I made a decision: I wasn't going to be silent anymore.
With my family's blessing, I would share our story in hopes of sparking a national conversation.
A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said, "Being strong is killing us." She's right.
We have got to retire those tired, old narratives of the strong black woman and the super-masculine black man, who, no matter how many times they get knocked down, just shake it off and soldier on.
Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.
Feelings mean we're human.
And when we deny our humanity, it leaves us feeling empty inside, searching for ways to self-medicate in order to fill the void.
My drug was high achievement.
These days, I share my story openly, and I ask others to share theirs, too. I believe that's what it takes to help people who may be suffering in silence to know that they are not alone and to know that with help, they can heal.
Now, I still have my struggles, particularly with the anxiety, but I'm able to manage it through daily mediation, yoga and a relatively healthy diet.
(Laughter)
If I feel like things are starting to spiral, I make an appointment to see my therapist, a dynamic black woman named Dawn Armstrong, who has a great sense of humor and a familiarity that I find comforting.
I will always regret that I couldn't be there for my nephew.
But my sincerest hope is that I can inspire others with the lesson that I've learned.
Life is beautiful. Sometimes it's messy, and it's always unpredictable.
But it will all be OK when you have your support system to help you through it.
I hope that if your burden gets too heavy, you'll ask for a hand, too.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm going to begin today with a story and end with a revolution. (Laughter) Are you ready?
Audience: Yes! Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.
All my life I wanted to be an actress.
From the time I was very small, I could feel the magic of storytelling and I wanted to be a part of it.
So, at the ripe age of 21, I graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and ready to take my rightful place as the next Meryl Streep.
(Laughter) That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep. Now, it's important for this story that you understand that I was raised by a raging feminist.
I mean, just to give you some idea: when I was five or six years old and obsessed with "The Sound of Music," and running around, singing, "I am 16 going on 17," all day every day, my mother sat me down for a very serious conversation and she said, "OK, look.
I'm not going to say that you can't sing that song, but if you are going to sing that song, I do need you to understand the extremely problematic gender construct that it reinforces. "(Laughter) So that's where I come from.
So it just honestly never even occurred to me that I would be prevented from doing anything in my life because I'm a woman.
OK. So I graduate. And I start auditioning and I get work, slowly.
But I just start noticing that the parts available for women are terrible.
But, remember -- I came here to play smart, willful, complicated, interesting complex, confident female characters, right? Like Meryl. And all of the sudden, I am wrestling with 300 other gorgeous, talented women to play ... "[Female] No dialogue.
The character only needs to stand on a balcony, look forlorn, and walk back inside the house.
Only partial nudity."
(Laughter)
"[Sarah] Brian's love interest.
Attractive, cute, and flirty, she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize throughout the entire film. "" [Mom] A proper Southern belle who is making peace with the fact that her only purpose in life is to tend to her husband. "" [Abby] Must be OK with a tastefully shot gang rape, along with performing 19th-century dance. "(Laughter) Those are actual casting notices.
And so I just mentioned this to my agent one day, I say, "I feel like I'm not really going in for parts that I'm actually excited about playing. And he said," Yeah. I don't really know what to do with you.
You're too smart for the parts that are being written for women in their 20s, and you're not quite pretty enough to be the hot one, so I think you'll work when you're 35. "(Laughter)
And I said, "Oh. That's funny. I always thought that when you were 35, you were kind of, like, over the hill as an actress, that you were relegated to playing 20-year-olds' mothers." And he said, "Yeah — (Laughter) It's just the way it is." So, maybe a year or so after this, I'm having lunch with an actress friend of mine, and we're talking about how insane this is.
And we decide, you know what? No problem. We'll just make our own movie.
And I'll write and then I'll write it about two complex female characters. So we do. We set out to make this movie, and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring an all-female production team: the writer, directors, producers, and it's a film about two women.
And so pretty soon, we're sitting in the office of a successful male producer, and he goes, "OK, girls.
So, you do understand that at some point you are going to have to hire a male producer onboard, right?
Just so that people will trust you with their money." Over and over again, people tell us, "Yeah, but people don't really want to see films about women, so maybe you should think about making something else.
It's just the way it is." So we make the movie, anyway.
We scrape together 80,000 dollars, and we make it, and it does so well.
It gets into tons of festivals and we win a lot of awards and it's big and exciting.
But these experiences I've had just keep rubbing at me.
And so, I just start talking about them, first, at Q and A's after screenings of the film, and then I get invited to be on panels and talk at conferences.
And the really amazing thing is that, to begin with, when I'm just talking to audiences and other people, you know, coming up in the film industry, the universal reaction is, "Oh my god! This is terrible. What do we do about this?" But the bigger panels I get on, suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me, "Look, I totally agree with everything you're saying.
You just need to be really careful about where you say it. "An Oscar-winning producer tells me that she doesn't think it's a good idea to play the woman card.
It's just the way it is."
And I think this is how sexism continues on in 2016, right?
For the most part, it happens casually -- unconsciously, even.
It happens because people are just trying to get along within an existing system.
It happens, maybe, out of a genuine desire to teach a young woman the way that the world "just is." The problem is that unless we do something about it, that is the way the world will always be.
So why should you care about this? Right? I mean, we're facing some rather significant problems in the world just at present, what does it really matter if I can't get a job, or you're stuck watching "Transformer 17," right? (Laughter) Well, let me put it to you this way: the year "Jaws" came out, Americans suddenly started listing "sharks" among their top 10 major fears.
In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise three million dollars to have James Bond switch from driving an Aston Martin to a BMW Z3.
That one move caused so many people to go out and buy that car, that BMW made 240 million dollars in pre-sales alone.
The year that "Brave" and "Hunger Games" came out, female participation in archery went up 105 percent.
(Laughter)
In fact, studies show that the movies you watch don't just affect your hobbies, they affect your career choices, your emotions, your sense of identity, your relationships, your mental health -- even your marital status.
So now, consider this: if you have watched mostly American movies in your lifetime, 95 percent of all the films you have ever seen were directed by men.
Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of all of the leading characters that you have ever seen were men.
And even if we just talk about the last five years, 55 percent of the time that you have seen a woman in a movie, she was naked or scantily clad. That affects you. That affects all of us.
We actually can't even imagine how much it affects us, because this is all we've ever had.
Stories -- and movies are just modern stories -- are not frivolous.
They're actually the mechanism through which we process our experience of being alive.
They're the way that we understand the world and our place in it.
They're the way we develop empathy for people who have experiences different than our own.
And right now, all of that is being funneled at us through the prism of this one perspective.
It's not that it's a bad perspective, but don't we deserve to hear them all?
How would the world be different if all of the stories were told?
So what do we do about this?
This may be the first time a lot of you are hearing about this, but a lot of us within the film industry have spent years -- a lot of people, a lot longer than I have -- giving speeches and doing panels and writing articles and doing studies, and really just yelling at Hollywood to do a better job about this.
I mean, we have really yelled at them.
And yet, Paramount and Fox recently released their slates, and of the 47 films that they will release between now and 2018, not a single one will be directed by a woman.
So it is beginning to occur to me that waiting for Hollywood to grow a conscience may not actually be a winning strategy.
In fact, it seems to me that whenever there is a small, ruling class of people who have all of the money and power and resources, they're not actually that excited about giving it up.
And so you don't get change by asking them or even yelling at them.
You have to make that change happen through a revolution.
Now, please don't worry — I promise you, here, now, today, our body count will be very low. (Laughter) So, now before I get to my four-point plan for the revolution — yes, I have a four-point plan — I have two pieces of very good and important news for you.
Good news number one: there are female filmmakers. (Cheers and applause)
Yes! I know! (Applause)
We exist! We actually graduate from film schools at the same rate that men do -- 50 percent.
So here we have our 50 women.
The problem is that as soon as you get to the micro-budget film, so even the very smallest films, we're already only directing 18 percent.
Then you get to slightly bigger films, indies in the $1-5 million budget range, and we go down to 12 percent.
So by the time you get to the studio system, we're only directing five percent of movies.
Now, I know some of you out there will look at this and secretly think to yourselves, "Well, maybe women just aren't as good at directing movies." And that's not a totally insane question.
I mean, we like to believe the film industry is a meritocracy, right?
(Laughter) (Laughs)
But look at this trajectory.
Either you have to accept that women are actually five percent as talented as men, which I don't, or you have to accept that there are serious systemic issues preventing us from getting from here to there.
But the good news is, we exist, and there is a vast amount of untapped potential over here.
Good news number two, and this is really good news: films by and about women make more money. Yes! Yes! It's true! (Cheers and applause)
It's true. The Washington Post recently released a study showing that films that feature women make 23 cents more on every dollar than films that don't.
Furthermore, my colleagues and I commissioned a study comparing 1,700 films made over the last five years and, looking at the average returns on investment -- so, how much money does that movie make -- comparing if a man or a woman filled each of the following roles: director, producer, screenwriter and lead actor.
And in every single category, the return on investment is higher if it's a woman.
Fact: women buy 51 percent of all movie tickets.
Films by and about women make more money.
(Laughter) And of course, at least some portion of the male population does also like women -- so "women films" are not just for women.
And yet, Hollywood only targets 18 percent of all of their films as "women films." So what you're left with is a giant underserved audience and untapped profit potential.
So we exist, and we have stories to tell.
We have so many stories to tell.
And despite everything we've heard: you want to see them.
(Laughter) The problem is, we've got this thing -- let's call it "Hollywood" -- no, no, I'm just kidding; I've met some very nice people in Hollywood -- Hollywood, preventing us from getting to you.
So here is my four-point plan for the revolution, and everybody -- man or woman, in this room or anywhere in the world -- is going to get to help.
And this revolution is not just for women.
Anyone who has been disenfranchised, anyone whose story has not been told, the same principles apply, and I really hope we can do the revolution together.
My four-point plan. Number one: watch movies.
Isn't this a good revolution?
(Laughter)
OK, first I want to talk to anyone who watches movies.
Who watches movies in here? Great! Will you pledge to watch one film by a female filmmaker per month?
That's it, just start there. Great! If you need help finding them, you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com It's an easily searchable database of films by women.
And as you start watching all movies, I just want you to pay attention to the female characters.
How many of them are there?
What are they wearing? Or not? Do they get to do cool things, or are they just there to emotionally support the men?
I'm telling you, once you see this, you're not going to be able to unsee it.
And as you start noticing this, it's going to shift your viewing habits.
And this already sizable market is going to continue to grow.
Step two: make movies.
So now I'm talking to all the female filmmakers out there: we need you to be very brave.
It will be harder for you to make movies.
In fact, there will be an entire industry constantly telling you that your stories don't matter.
And we need you to make them, anyway.
That 18 percent in the micro-budget range -- that is on us to fix.
Don't wait for permission.
Don't wait for somebody to pick you, because 95 percent says they are not going to. Crowd fund. Write letters to eccentric relatives.
I know how hard it is, but you have to make your movies -- now, today, features, not shorts.
There is an audience for them, and they want and need to see them.
Three: invest in each other.
Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like we need to stop wasting so much energy on a system that does not want us.
We need to find our audience and invest in cultivating them.
If we can figure out how to make our movies and deliver them to the audiences that want them, that's it.
That's the whole game.
And whatever they're doing in the middle is going to cease to be quite so important.
Audiences, invest in us.
Help us make the movies that you want to see.
If you can give a female filmmaker 25 dollars in a crowdfunding campaign, great, do that.
If you can invest more seriously and help us over that critical million-dollar hurdle, do that.
But invest in seeing the other half of the story.
Four: disrupt through business.
So now I'm talking to all of the businesspeople and entrepreneurs.
This does not happen very often in the world, but right here we have a golden situation in which you can enact significant social change while also making money.
Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption.
The old models of financing and distribution are crumbling -- please come in and disrupt it.
I'll give you an example.
Right now, with some incredible women, I am launching the "The 51 Fund." It's a venture capital fund that will finance films written, directed and produced by women in that critical $1-5 million range.
We will give a significant number of female filmmakers the chance to make their movies and we will deliver them to the audiences who want them.
Good for equality, good for business.
But that's only one example, we need more.
There is room for so many more.
So I say to you: Hollywood is leaving money on the table.
(Applause) Come pick it up. Now, all of this may seem like a lot, but it is actually so doable.
Entrenched systems don't change because you ask the people in charge, they change because all of the people who don't have what they want rise up and make that change happen.
And don't you want to?
I want to see what the other 51 percent of the population has to say.
I want to watch movies that teach me about people who are different than I am.
I want to see women's bodies on film that aren't perfect.
I want to give our little boys the chance to empathize with female characters so that they can become more whole men.
And I definitely want to give a little girl who may not have a real-life role model the chance to watch movies and see women doing everything she dreams of achieving.
This is not about making one industry better.
This is about making a better world. Will you help? The time for waiting is over.
(Cheers and applause) The time for the revolution is now.
Some months back, I was visiting this East African city, and we were stuck in traffic.
And this vendor suddenly approaches my window with a half-opened alphabet sheet.
I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet, and I thought of my daughter, how it would be nice to spread it on the floor and just play all over it with her while getting her to learn the alphabet.
So the traffic moved a bit, and I quickly grabbed a copy, and we moved on.
When I had time to fully open the alphabet sheet and take a more detailed look at it, I knew I was not going to use that to teach my daughter.
I regretted my purchase. Why so? Looking at the alphabet sheet reminded me of the fact that not much has changed in the education curricula in Africa.
Some decades back, I was taught out of a similar alphabet sheet.
And because of that, I struggled for years.
I struggled to reconcile my reality with the formal education I received in school, in the schools I attended.
I had identity crises.
I looked down on my reality.
I looked at my ancestry, I looked at my lineage with disrespect.
I had very little patience for what my life had to offer around me.
Why? "A is for apple." "A is for apple." "A is for apple" is for that child in that part of the world where apples grow out; who has an apple in her lunch bag; who goes to the grocery store with her mom and sees red, green, yellow — apples of all shapes and colors and sizes.
And so, introducing education to this child with an alphabet sheet like this fulfills one of the major functions of education, which is to introduce the learner to an appreciation of the learner's environment and a curiosity to explore more in order to add value.
In my own case, when and where I grew up in Africa, apple was an exotic fruit.
Two or three times a year, I could get some yellowish apples with brown dots, you know, signifying thousands of miles traveled — warehouses storing — to get to me.
I grew up in the city to very financially comfortable parents, so it was my dignified reality, exactly the same way cassava fufu or ugali would not regularly feature in an American, Chinese or Indian diet, apples didn't count as part of my reality.
So what this did to me, introducing education to me with "A is for apple," made education an abstraction.
It made it something out of my reach -- a foreign concept, a phenomenon for which I would have to constantly and perpetually seek the validation of those it belonged to for me to make progress within it and with it.
That was tough for a child; it would be tough for anyone.
As I grew up and I advanced academically, my reality was further separated from my education.
In history, I was taught that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park discovered the Niger River.
And so it bothered me.
My great-great-grandparents grew up quite close to the edge of the Niger River.
(Laughter)
And it took someone to travel thousands of miles from Europe to discover a river right under their nose?
(Laughter)
No!
What did they do with their time?
(Laughter)
Playing board games, roasting fresh yams, fighting tribal wars?
I mean, I just knew my education was preparing me to go somewhere else and practice and give to another environment that it belonged to.
It was not for my environment, where and when I grew up.
And this continued. This philosophy undergirded my studies all through the time I studied in Africa.
It took a lot of experiences and some studies for me to begin to have a change of mindset.
I will share a couple of the remarkable ones with us.
I was in the United States in Washington, DC studying towards my doctorate, and I got this consultancy position with the World Bank Africa Region.
And so I remember one day, my boss -- we were having a conversation on some project, and he mentioned a particular World Bank project, a large-scale irrigation project that cost millions of dollars in Niger Republic that was faltering sustainably.
He said this project wasn't so sustainable, and it bothered those that instituted the whole package.
But then he mentioned a particular project, a particular traditional irrigation method that was hugely successful in the same Niger Republic where the World Bank project was failing.
And that got me thinking.
So I did further research, and I found out about Tassa.
Tassa is a traditional irrigation method where 20- to 30-centimeter-wide and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes are dug across a field to be cultivated.
Then, a small dam is constructed around the field, and then crops are planted across the surface area.
What happens is that when rain falls, the holes are able to store the water and appropriate it to the extent that the plant needs the water.
The plant can only assimilate as much water as needed until harvest time.
Niger is 75 percent scorched desert, so this is something that is a life-or-death situation, and it has been used for centuries.
In an experiment that was conducted, two similar plots of land were used in the experiment, and one plot of land did not have the Tassa technique on it. Similar plots. The other one had Tassa technique constructed on it.
Then similar grains of millet also were planted on both plots.
During harvest time, the plot of land without Tassa technique yielded 11 kilograms of millet per hectare.
The plot of land with Tassa technique yielded 553 kilograms of millet per hectare.
(Applause)
I looked at the research, and I looked at myself.
I said, "I studied agriculture for 12 years, from primary to Senior Six, as we say in East Africa, SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.
No one ever taught me of any form of traditional African knowledge of cultivation -- of harvesting, of anything -- that will work in modern times and actually succeed, where something imported from the West would struggle to succeed. That was when I knew the challenge, the challenge of Africa's curricula, And I thus began my quest to dedicate my life, concern my life work, to studying, conducting research on Africa's own knowledge system and being able to advocate for its mainstreaming in education, in research, policy across sectors and industries.
Another conversation and experience I had at the bank I guess made me take that final decision of where I was going to go, even though it wasn't the most lucrative research to go into, but it was just about what I believed in.
And so one day, my boss said that he likes to go to Africa to negotiate World Bank loans and to work on World Bank projects. And I was intrigued. I asked him why.
He said, "Oh, when I go to Africa, it's so easy.
I just write up my loan documents and my project proposal in Washington, DC, I go to Africa, and they all just get signed.
I get the best deal, and I'm back to base.
My bosses are happy with me."
But then he said, "I hate going to Asia or ..." and he mentioned a particular country, Asia and some of these countries. "They keep me for this, trying to get the best deal for their countries.
They get the best deal.
They tell me, 'Oh, that clause will not work for us in our environment.
It's not our reality.
It's just so Western. 'And they tell me,' Oh, we have enough experts to take care of this.
You don't have enough experts.
We know our aim.' And they just keep going through all these things.
By the time they finish, yes, they get the best deal, but I'm so exhausted and I don't get the best deal for the bank, and we're in business." "Really?" I thought in my head, "OK."
I was privileged to sit in on a loan negotiating session in an African country.
So I would do these consultancy positions during summer, you know, since I was a doctoral student.
And then I traveled with the team, with the World Bank team, as more like someone to help out with organizational matters.
But I sat in during the negotiating session.
I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know, with me from Washington, DC.
And I looked across the table at my African brothers and sisters.
I could see intimidation on their faces.
"A is for apple." They didn't believe they had anything to offer the great-great-grandchildren of Mungo Park -- the owners of "apple" in "A is for apple." They just sat and watched: "Oh, just give us, let us sign.
You know it all. Just, where do we sign?
Show us, let us sign. "They had no voice.
They didn't believe in themselves.
Excuse me.
And so, I have been doing this for a decade.
I have been conducting research on Africa's knowledge system, original, authentic, traditional knowledge.
In the few cases where this has been implemented in Africa, there has been remarkable successes recorded.
I think of Gacaca. Gacaca is Rwanda's traditional judicial system that was used after the genocide.
In 1994, when the genocide ended, Rwanda's national court system was in shambles: no judges, no lawyers to try hundreds of thousands of genocide cases.
So the government of Rwanda came up with this idea to resuscitate a traditional judicial system known as Gacaca.
Gacaca is a community-based judicial system, where community members come together to elect men and women of proven integrity to try cases of crimes committed within these communities.
So by the time Gacaca concluded its trial of genocide cases in 2012, 12,000 community-based courts had tried approximately 1.2 million cases.
That's a record.
(Applause)
Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized Rwanda's traditional philosophy of reconciliation and reintegration, as against the whole punitive and banishment idea that undergirds present-day Western style.
And not to compare, but just to say that it really emphasized Rwanda's traditional method of philosophy.
And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania —
(Applause)
who said that you cannot develop people.
People will have to develop themselves.
I agree with Mwalimu.
I am convinced that Africa's further transformation, Africa's advancement, rests simply in the acknowledgment, validation and mainstreaming of Africa's own traditional, authentic, original, indigenous knowledge in education, in research, in policy making and across sectors.
This is not going to be easy for Africa.
It is not going to be easy for a people used to being told how to think, what to do, how to go about it, a people long subjected to the intellectual guidance and direction of others, be they the colonial masters, aid industry or international news media.
But it is a task that we have to do to make progress.
I am strengthened by the words of Joseph Shabalala, founder of the South African choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
He said that the task ahead of us can never, ever be greater than the power within us.
We can do it.
We can unlearn looking down on ourselves.
We can learn to place value on our reality and our knowledge.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you.
"Robam kbach boran," or the art of Khmer classical dance, is more than 1,000 years old.
It was developed as a prayer in movement for rain and fertility, and a prosperity that this meant for an agricultural society.
Dancers who were both men and women were offered to temples where they served as living bridges between heaven and earth.
Their dancing bodies carried the prayers of the people up to the gods, and the will of the deities was delivered back through them to the people and the land.
There are a lot of curves in Khmer dance.
Our backs are arched, our knees are bent, our toes are curled, our elbows are hyperflexed and our fingers are curved backwards.
All of these curves create a serpentine impression, and this is important because before the introduction of major religions, Khmers, and people all over the world practiced animism.
Serpents were especially important in this belief system because in their fluid, curvilinear movement, they mimicked the flow of water.
So to invoke the serpent in your dancing body then was to conjure the image of rivers cutting across the earth: inspire the flow of life-giving waters.
As you can see then, Khmer classical dance is a transformation of nature, of both the physical world around us and of our own internal universe.
We have four primary hand gestures that we use.
Can we do them together? Yeah? OK.
This is a tree. That tree will grow, and then it will have leaves.
After it has leaves, it'll have flowers, and after it has flowers, it'll have fruit.
That fruit will drop and a new tree will grow.
And in those four gestures is the cycle of life.
These four gestures are then used to create a whole entire language with which dancers express themselves.
So for example, I can say, "I." "I." In dance that would be... "I." Or I can say... "Hey you, come here, come here." In dance... "Come here," or, "Go, go."
(Laughter)
"Go." And everything from... love... to sadness, to —
(Stomping)
anger can be expressed through the dance as well.
There's a certain magic in the way that things are filtered, transformed and put together to create limitless possibilities in art.
The Khmer word for art, silapak, in fact, at its root, means "magic." The artist -- the silapakar, or the silapakarani, then, is nothing short of a magician.
I am very proud to say that I belong to a long line of magicians, from my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro, to her teachers who were stars in the royal palace, to the ancient dancers of Angkor and to the primal villagers from which the art form originally took life.
That said, our cherished heritage was once almost completely destroyed.
If you are wearing glasses, please stand up.
please stand up. If you speak more than one language,
please stand up. If you have light skin,
Your glasses meant that you could afford health care.
That second or third language you spoke indicated your elite education.
Your light skin meant you didn't have to work beneath the sun.
Under the Khmer Rouge, who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, we would all be dead now, targeted because of our assumed privilege.
You see, the Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia, and they saw centuries of rigid inequality.
The king and the few elites around him had all the pleasures and comforts of the world while the mass majority suffered from backbreaking labor and harsh poverty.
You don't need a history book to see that this is true.
The Khmer word for "I," for "me," is khnhom.
This very same word can also mean "slave" and dancers were in fact known as knhom preah robam, or "slaves of the sacred dance." The Khmer Rouge sought to end slavery in Cambodia, yet somehow they turned everyone into slaves to do it.
They became the oppression that they sought to end.
They evacuated the capital and forced people into labor camps.
They tore families apart and brainwashed children against their own parents.
Everywhere, people were dying and being killed, losing their lives from disease, overwork, execution and starvation.
The result of this is that an entire third of Cambodia's population was lost in less than four years, and in that number were 90 percent of Khmer dance artists.
In other words, nine out of 10 visions for the tradition and future were lost.
Thankfully, however, it was my teacher's teachers, Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon, who would lead the revival of the art form from the ashes of war and genocide: one student, one gesture, one dance at a time.
They wrote the love, magic, beauty, history and philosophy of our lineage into the bodies of the next generation.
Nearly 40 years later, Khmer classical dance has been revived to new heights.
Yet somehow it still exists in a vulnerable environment.
The disastrous effects of war still haunt Khmer people today.
It is written in our bodies, manifested in a genetic passage of PTSD and in families facing cyclical poverty and immense cultural rifts and language barriers.
Yet beauty is a most resilient thing.
Beauty has this ability to grow anywhere and everywhere at any time.
Beauty is what connects people through time and place.
Beauty is a liberation from suffering.
As Khmer artists work to revive our culture and country, we find that there are many paths in which to move forward into the future.
And in a tradition where we often don't know the dancer's names, who they were, what their lives were like, what they felt, let me propose that we move forward honestly and openly from "khnhom." Khnhom not as in slave, but as in conscious service.
Khnhom: "I," "me," "flowering."
My name is Prumsodun Ok.
I am Khmer, and I am American.
I am the child of refugees, a creator, a healer, and a builder of bridges.
I am my teacher's first male student in a tradition understood by many as female, and I founded Cambodia's first gay dance company.
I am the incarnation of the beauty, dreams and power of those who came before me.
The convergence of past, present and future, and of individual and collective.
Let me then play that ancient and ageless role of the artist as messenger, by sharing the words of Chheng Phon "A garden with only one type of flower, or flowers of only one color, is no good." This is a reminder that our strength, growth, survival and very existence, lies in diversity.
It is, however, a message of courage as well.
For a flower does not ask for anyone's permission to bloom.
It was born to offer itself to the world.
Fearless love is its nature.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want us to start by thinking about this device, the phone that's very likely in your pockets right now.
Over 40 percent of Americans check their phones within five minutes of waking up every morning.
And then they look at it another 50 times during the day.
Grownups consider this device to be a necessity.
But now I want you to imagine it in the hands of a three-year-old, and as a society, we get anxious.
Parents are very worried that this device is going to stunt their children's social growth; that it's going to keep them from getting up and moving; that somehow, this is going to disrupt childhood.
So, I want to challenge this attitude.
I can envision a future where we would be excited to see a preschooler interacting with a screen.
These screens can get kids up and moving even more.
They have the power to tell us more about what a child is learning than a standardized test can.
And here's the really crazy thought: I believe that these screens have the power to prompt more real-life conversations between kids and their parents.
Now, I was perhaps an unlikely champion for this cause.
I studied children's literature because I was going to work with kids and books.
But about 20 years ago, I had an experience that shifted my focus. I was helping lead a research study about preschoolers and websites.
And I walked in and was assigned a three-year-old named Maria.
Maria had actually never seen a computer before.
So the first thing I had to do was teach her how to use the mouse, and when I opened up the screen, she moved it across the screen, and she stopped on a character named X the Owl.
And when she did that, the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.
Maria dropped the mouse, pushed back from the table, leaped up and started waving frantically back at him.
Her connection to that character was visceral.
This wasn't a passive screen experience.
This was a human experience.
And it was exactly appropriate for a three-year-old.
I've now worked at PBS Kids for more than 15 years, and my work there is focused on harnessing the power of technology as a positive in children's lives.
I believe that as a society, we're missing a big opportunity.
We're letting our fear and our skepticism about these devices hold us back from realizing their potential in our children's lives.
Fear about kids and technology is nothing new; we've been here before.
Over 50 years ago, the debate was raging about the newly dominant media: the television.
That box in the living room?
It might be separating kids from one another.
It might keep them away from the outside world.
But this is the moment when Fred Rogers, the long-running host of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," challenged society to look at television as a tool, a tool that could promote emotional growth.
Here's what he did: he looked out from the screen, and he held a conversation, as if he were speaking to each child individually about feelings.
And then he would pause and let them think about them.
You can see his influence across the media landscape today, but at the time, this was revolutionary.
He shifted the way we looked at television in the lives of children.
Today it's not just one box.
Kids are surrounded by devices.
And I'm also a parent -- I understand this feeling of anxiety.
But I want us to look at three common fears that parents have, and see if we can shift our focus to the opportunity that's in each of them.
So. Fear number one: "Screens are passive.
This is going to keep our kids from getting up and moving." Chris Kratt and Martin Kratt are zoologist brothers who host a show about animals called "Wild Kratts." And they approached the PBS team to say, "Can we do something with those cameras that are built into every device now?
Could those cameras capture a very natural kid play pattern -- pretending to be animals?"
So we started with bats.
And when kids came in to play this game, they loved seeing themselves on-screen with wings.
But my favorite part of this, when the game was over and we turned off the screens?
The kids kept being bats.
They kept flying around the room, they kept veering left and right to catch mosquitoes.
And they remembered things.
They remembered that bats fly at night. And they remembered that when bats sleep, they hang upside down and fold their wings in.
This game definitely got kids up and moving.
But also, now when kids go outside, do they look at a bird and think, "How does a bird fly differently than I flew when I was a bat?" The digital technology prompted embodied learning that kids can now take out into the world.
Fear number two: "Playing games on these screens is just a waste of time.
It's going to distract children from their education." Game developers know that you can learn a lot about a player's skill by looking at the back-end data: Where did a player pause?
Where did they make a few mistakes before they found the right answer?
My team wanted to take that tool set and apply it to academic learning.
Our producer in Boston, WGBH, created a series of Curious George games focused on math.
And researchers came in and had 80 preschoolers play these games.
They then gave all 80 of those preschoolers a standardized math test.
We could see early on that these games were actually helping kids understand some key skills.
But our partners at UCLA wanted us to dig deeper.
They focus on data analysis and student assessment.
And they wanted to take that back-end game-play data and see if they could use it to predict a child's math scores.
So they made a neural net -- they essentially trained the computer to use this data, and here are the results.
This is a subset of the children's standardized math scores.
And this is the computer's prediction of each child's score, based on playing some Curious George games.
The prediction is astonishingly accurate, especially considering the fact that these games weren't built for assessment.
than a standardized test can. The team that did this study believes that games like these can teach us more about a child's cognitive learning
What if games could reduce testing time in the classroom?
What if they could reduce testing anxiety?
How could they give teachers snapshots of insight to help them better focus their individualized learning?
So the third fear I want to address is the one that I think is often the biggest.
And that's this: "These screens are isolating me from my child." Let's play out a scenario.
Let's say that you are a parent, and you need 25 minutes of uninterrupted time to get dinner ready.
And in order to do that, you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.
Now, this is a moment where you probably feel very guilty about what you just did.
But now imagine this: Twenty minutes later, you receive a text message. on that cell phone that's always within arm's reach.
And it says: "Alex just matched five rhyming words.
Ask him to play this game with you.
Can you think of a word that rhymes with 'cat'?
Or how about 'ball'?" In our studies, when parents receive simple tips like these, they felt empowered.
They were so excited to play these games at the dinner table with their kids.
And the kids loved it, too.
Not only did it feel like magic that their parents knew what they had been playing, kids love to play games with their parents.
Just the act of talking to kids about their media can be incredibly powerful.
Last summer, Texas Tech University published a study that the show "Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood" could promote the development of empathy among children.
But there was a really important catch to this study: the greatest benefit was only when parents talked to kids about what they watched.
Neither just watching nor just talking about it was enough; it was the combination that was key.
So when I read this study, I started thinking about how rarely parents of preschoolers actually talk to kids about the content of what they're playing and what they're watching.
And so I decided to try it with my four-year-old.
I said, "Were you playing a car game earlier today?" And Benjamin perked up and said, "Yes!
And did you see that I made my car out of a pickle?
It was really hard to open the trunk."
(Laughter)
This hilarious conversation about what was fun in the game and what could have been better continued all the way to school that morning.
I'm not here to suggest to you that all digital media is great for kids.
There are legitimate reasons for us to be concerned about the current state of children's content on these screens.
And it's right for us to be thinking about balance: Where do screens fit against all the other things that a child needs to do to learn and to grow?
But when we fixate on our fears about it, we forget a really major point, and that is, that kids are living in the same world that we live in, the world where the grownups check their phones more than 50 times a day.
Screens are a part of children's lives.
And if we pretend that they aren't, or if we get overwhelmed by our fear, kids are never going to learn how and why to use them.
What if we start raising our expectations for this media?
What if we start talking to kids regularly about the content on these screens?
What if we start looking for the positive impacts that this technology can have in our children's lives?
That's when the potential of these tools can become a reality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So there's a lot of valid concern these days that our technology is getting so smart that we've put ourselves on the path to a jobless future.
And I think the example of a self-driving car is actually the easiest one to see.
So these are going to be fantastic for all kinds of different reasons.
But did you know that "driver" is actually the most common job in 29 of the 50 US states?
What's going to happen to these jobs when we're no longer driving our cars or cooking our food or even diagnosing our own diseases?
Well, a recent study from Forrester Research goes so far to predict that 25 million jobs might disappear over the next 10 years.
To put that in perspective, that's three times as many jobs lost in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
And it's not just blue-collar jobs that are at risk.
On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley, we are seeing tremendous gains in the quality of analysis and decision-making because of machine learning.
So even the smartest, highest-paid people will be affected by this change.
What's clear is that no matter what your job is, at least some, if not all of your work, is going to be done by a robot or software in the next few years.
And that's exactly why people like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates are talking about the need for government-funded minimum income levels.
But if our politicians can't agree on things like health care or even school lunches, I just don't see a path where they'll find consensus on something as big and as expensive as universal basic life income.
Instead, I think the response needs to be led by us in industry.
We have to recognize the change that's ahead of us and start to design the new kinds of jobs that will still be relevant in the age of robotics.
The good news is that we have faced down and recovered two mass extinctions of jobs before.
From 1870 to 1970, the percent of American workers based on farms fell by 90 percent, and then again from 1950 to 2010, the percent of Americans working in factories fell by 75 percent.
The challenge we face this time, however, is one of time.
We had a hundred years to move from farms to factories, and then 60 years to fully build out a service economy.
The rate of change today suggests that we may only have 10 or 15 years to adjust, and if we don't react fast enough, that means by the time today's elementary-school students are college-aged, we could be living in a world that's robotic, largely unemployed and stuck in kind of un-great depression.
But I don't think it has to be this way.
You see, I work in innovation, and part of my job is to shape how large companies apply new technologies.
Certainly some of these technologies are even specifically designed to replace human workers.
But I believe that if we start taking steps right now to change the nature of work, we can not only create environments where people love coming to work but also generate the innovation that we need to replace the millions of jobs that will be lost to technology.
I believe that the key to preventing our jobless future is to rediscover what makes us human, and to create a new generation of human-centered jobs that allow us to unlock the hidden talents and passions that we carry with us every day.
But first, I think it's important to recognize that we brought this problem on ourselves.
And it's not just because, you know, we are the one building the robots.
But even though most jobs left the factory decades ago, we still hold on to this factory mindset of standardization and de-skilling.
We still define jobs around procedural tasks and then pay people for the number of hours that they perform these tasks.
We've created narrow job definitions like cashier, loan processor or taxi driver and then asked people to form entire careers around these singular tasks.
These choices have left us with actually two dangerous side effects.
The first is that these narrowly defined jobs will be the first to be displaced by robots, because single-task robots are just the easiest kinds to build.
But second, we have accidentally made it so that millions of workers around the world have unbelievably boring working lives.
(Laughter)
Let's take the example of a call center agent.
Over the last few decades, we brag about lower operating costs because we've taken most of the need for brainpower out of the person and put it into the system.
For most of their day, they click on screens, they read scripts.
They act more like machines than humans.
And unfortunately, over the next few years, as our technology gets more advanced, they, along with people like clerks and bookkeepers, will see the vast majority of their work disappear.
To counteract this, we have to start creating new jobs that are less centered on the tasks that a person does and more focused on the skills that a person brings to work.
For example, robots are great at repetitive and constrained work, but human beings have an amazing ability to bring together capability with creativity when faced with problems that we've never seen before.
It's when every day brings a little bit of a surprise that we have designed work for humans and not for robots.
Our entrepreneurs and engineers already live in this world, but so do our nurses and our plumbers and our therapists.
You know, it's the nature of too many companies and organizations to just ask people to come to work and do your job.
But if you work is better done by a robot, or your decisions better made by an AI, what are you supposed to be doing?
Well, I think for the manager, we need to realistically think about the tasks that will be disappearing over the next few years and start planning for more meaningful, more valuable work that should replace it.
We need to create environments where both human beings and robots thrive.
I say, let's give more work to the robots, and let's start with the work that we absolutely hate doing.
Here, robot, process this painfully idiotic report.
(Laughter)
And move this box. Thank you.
(Laughter)
And for the human beings, we should follow the advice from Harry Davis at the University of Chicago.
He says we have to make it so that people don't leave too much of themselves in the trunk of their car.
I mean, human beings are amazing on weekends.
Think about the people that you know and what they do on Saturdays.
They're artists, carpenters, chefs and athletes.
But on Monday, they're back to being Junior HR Specialist and Systems Analyst 3.
(Laughter)
You know, these narrow job titles not only sound boring, but they're actually a subtle encouragement for people to make narrow and boring job contributions.
But I've seen firsthand that when you invite people to be more, they can amaze us with how much more they can be.
A few years ago, I was working at a large bank that was trying to bring more innovation into its company culture.
So my team and I designed a prototyping contest that invited anyone to build anything that they wanted.
We were actually trying to figure out whether or not the primary limiter to innovation was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent, and it turns out it was neither one.
It was an empowerment problem.
And the results of the program were amazing.
We started by inviting people to reenvision what it is they could bring to a team.
This contest was not only a chance to build anything that you wanted but also be anything that you wanted.
And when people were no longer limited by their day-to-day job titles, they felt free to bring all kinds of different skills and talents to the problems that they were trying to solve.
We saw technology people being designers, marketing people being architects, and even finance people showing off their ability to write jokes.
(Laughter)
We ran this program twice, and each time more than 400 people brought their unexpected talents to work and solved problems that they had been wanting to solve for years.
Collectively, they created millions of dollars of value, building things like a better touch-tone system for call centers, easier desktop tools for branches and even a thank you card system that has become a cornerstone of the employee working experience.
Over the course of the eight weeks, people flexed muscles that they never dreamed of using at work.
People learned new skills, they met new people, and at the end, somebody pulled me aside and said, "I have to tell you, the last few weeks has been one of the most intense, hardest working experiences of my entire life, but not one second of it felt like work."
And that's the key.
For those few weeks, people got to be creators and innovators.
They had been dreaming of solutions to problems that had been bugging them for years, and this was a chance to turn those dreams into a reality.
And that dreaming is an important part of what separates us from machines.
For now, our machines do not get frustrated, they do not get annoyed, and they certainly don't imagine.
But we, as human beings -- we feel pain, we get frustrated.
And it's when we're most annoyed and most curious that we're motivated to dig into a problem and create change.
Our imaginations are the birthplace of new products, new services, and even new industries.
I believe that the jobs of the future will come from the minds of people who today we call analysts and specialists, but only if we give them the freedom and protection that they need to grow into becoming explorers and inventors.
If we really want to robot-proof our jobs, we, as leaders, need to get out of the mindset of telling people what to do and instead start asking them what problems they're inspired to solve and what talents they want to bring to work.
Because when you can bring your Saturday self to work on Wednesdays, you'll look forward to Mondays more, and those feelings that we have about Mondays are part of what makes us human.
And as we redesign work for an era of intelligent machines, I invite you all to work alongside me to bring more humanity to our working lives.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I recently read about what the young generation of workers want in Harvard Business Review.
One thing that stuck out to me was: don't just talk about impact, but make an impact.
I'm a little bit older than you, maybe much older than you, but this is exactly the same goal that I had when I was in college.
I wanted to make my own impact for those who live under injustice; it's the reason that I became a documentary journalist, the reason I became a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days.
It was March 17, 2009.
It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you, but it was the day that turned my life upside down.
My team and I were making a documentary about North Korean refugees living below human life in China.
We were at the border.
It was our last day of filming.
There was no wire fence or bars or sign to show that it is the border, but this is a place that a lot of North Korean defectors use as an escape route.
It was still winter, and the river was frozen.
When we were in the middle of the frozen river, we were filming about the condition of the cold weather and the environment that North Koreans had to deal with when they seek their freedom.
And suddenly, one of my team members shouted, "Soldiers!" So I looked back, and there were two small soldiers in green uniforms with rifles, chasing after us.
We all ran as fast as we could.
I prayed that, please don't let them shoot my head.
And I was thinking that, if my feet are on Chinese soil, I'll be safe.
And I made it to Chinese soil.
Then I saw my colleague Laura Ling fall on her knees.
I didn't know what to do at that short moment, but I knew that I could not leave her alone there when she said, "Euna, I can't feel my legs."
In a flash, we were surrounded by these two Korean soldiers.
They were not much bigger than us, but they were determined to take us to their army base.
I begged and yelled for any kind of help, hoping that someone would show up from China.
Here I was, being stubborn towards a trained soldier with a gun.
I looked at his eyes.
He was just a boy.
At that moment, he raised his rifle to hit me, but I saw that he was hesitating.
His eyes were shaking, and his rifle was still up in the air.
So I shouted at him, "OK, OK, I'll walk with you." And I got up.
When we arrived at their army base, my head was spinning with these worst-case scenarios, and my colleague's statement wasn't helping.
She said, "We are the enemy." She was right: we were the enemy.
And I was supposed to be frightened, too.
But I kept having these odd experiences.
This time, an officer brought me his coat to keep me warm, because I lost my coat on the frozen river while battling with one of these soldiers.
I will tell you what I mean by these odd experiences.
I grew up in South Korea.
To us, North Korea was always the enemy, even before I was born.
South and North have been under armistice for 63 years, since the end of the Korean War.
And growing up in the South in the '80s and '90s, we were taught propaganda about North Korea.
And we heard so many graphic stories, such as, a little young boy being brutally killed by North Korean spies just because he said, "I don't like communists." Or, I watched this cartoon series about a young South Korean boy defeating these fat, big, red pig, which represented the North Koreans' first leader at the time.
And the effect of hearing these horrible stories over and over instilled one word in a young mind: "enemy." And I think at some point, I dehumanized them, and the people of North Korea became equated with the North Korean government.
Now, back to my detention.
It was the second day of being in a cell.
I had not slept since I was out at the border.
This young guard came to my cell and offered me this small boiled egg and said, "This will give you strength to keep going." Do you know what it is like, receiving a small kindness in the enemy's hand?
Whenever they were kind to me, I thought the worst case was waiting for me after the kindness.
One officer noticed my nervousness.
He said, "Did you think we were all these red pigs?" referring to the cartoon that I just showed you.
Every day was like a psychological battle.
The interrogator had me sit at a table six days a week and had me writing down about my journey, my work, over and over until I wrote down the confession that they wanted to hear.
After about three months of detention, the North Korean court sentenced me to 12 years in a labor camp.
So I was just sitting in my room to be transferred.
At that time, I really had nothing else to do, so I paid attention to these two female guards and listened to what they were talking about.
Guard A was older, and she studied English.
She seemed like she came from an affluent family.
She often showed up with these colorful dresses, and then loved to show off.
And Guard B was the younger one, and she was a really good singer.
She loved to sing Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On" -- sometimes too much.
She knew just how to torture me without knowing.
(Laughter)
And this girl spent a lot of time in the morning to put on makeup, like you can see in any young girl's life.
And they loved to watch this Chinese drama, a better quality production.
I remember Guard B said, "I can no longer watch our TV shows after watching this." She got scolded for degrading her own country's produced TV shows.
Guard B had more of a free mind than Guard A, and she often got scolded by Guard A whenever she expressed herself.
One day, they invited all these female colleagues -- I don't know where they came from -- to where I was held, and they invited me to their guard room and asked if one-night stands really happen in the US.
(Laughter)
This is the country where young couples are not even allowed to hold hands in public.
I had no idea where they had gotten this information, but they were shy and giggly even before I said anything.
I think we all forgot that I was their prisoner, and it was like going back to my high school classroom again.
And I learned that these girls also grew up watching a similar cartoon, but just propaganda towards South Korea and the US.
I started to understand where these people's anger was coming from.
If these girls grew up learning that we are enemies, it was just natural that they would hate us just as I feared them.
But at that moment, we were all just girls who shared the same interests, beyond our ideologies that separated us.
I shared these stories with my boss at Current TV at the time after I came home.
His first reaction was, "Euna, have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome?" Yes, and I clearly remember the feeling of fear and being threatened, and tension rising up between me and the interrogator when we talked about politics.
There definitely was a wall that we couldn't climb over.
But we were able to see each other as human beings when we talked about family, everyday life, the importance of the future for our children.
It was about a month before I came home. I got really sick.
Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye, because she was leaving the detention center.
She made sure that no one watched us, no one heard us, and quietly said, "I hope you get better and go back to your family soon." It is these people -- the officer who brought me his coat, the guard who offered me a boiled egg, these female guards who asked me about dating life in the US -- they are the ones that I remember of North Korea: humans just like us.
North Koreans and I were not ambassadors of our countries, but I believe that we were representing the human race.
Now I'm back home and back to my life.
The memory of these people has blurred as time has passed.
And I'm in this place where I read and hear about North Korea provoking the US.
I realized how easy it is to see them as an enemy again.
But I have to keep reminding myself that when I was over there, I was able to see humanity over hatred in my enemy's eyes.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Since 2009, the world has been stuck on a single narrative around a coming global food crisis and what we need to do to avoid it.
How do we feed nine billion people by 2050?
Every conference, podcast and dialogue around global food security starts with this question and goes on to answer it by saying we need to produce 70 percent more food.
The 2050 narrative started to evolve shortly after global food prices hit all-time highs in 2008.
People were suffering and struggling, governments and world leaders needed to show us that they were paying attention and were working to solve it.
The thing is, 2050 is so far into the future that we can't even relate to it, and more importantly, if we keep doing what we're doing, it's going to hit us a lot sooner than that.
I believe we need to ask a different question.
The answer to that question needs to be framed differently.
If we can reframe the old narrative and replace it with new numbers that tell us a more complete pictures, numbers that everyone can understand and relate to, we can avoid the crisis altogether.
I was a commodities trader in my past life and one of the things that I learned trading is that every market has a tipping point, the point at which change occurs so rapidly that it impacts the world and things change forever.
Think of the last financial crisis, or the dot-com crash.
So here's my concern.
We could have a tipping point in global food and agriculture if surging demand surpasses the agricultural system's structural capacity to produce food.
This means at this point supply can no longer keep up with demand despite exploding prices, unless we can commit to some type of structural change.
This time around, it won't be about stock markets and money.
It's about people.
People could starve and governments may fall.
This question of at what point does supply struggle to keep up with surging demand is one that started off as an interest for me while I was trading and became an absolute obsession.
It went from interest to obsession when I realized through my research how broken the system was and how very little data was being used to make such critical decisions.
That's the point I decided to walk away from a career on Wall Street and start an entrepreneurial journey to start Gro Intelligence.
At Gro, we focus on bringing this data and doing the work to make it actionable, to empower decision-makers at every level.
But doing this work, we also realized that the world, not just world leaders, but businesses and citizens like every single person in this room, lacked an actionable guide on how we can avoid a coming global food security crisis.
And so we built a model, leveraging the petabytes of data we sit on, and we solved for the tipping point.
Now, no one knows we've been working on this problem and this is the first time that I'm sharing what we discovered.
We discovered that the tipping point is actually a decade from now.
We discovered that the world will be short 214 trillion calories by 2027.
The world is not in a position to fill this gap.
Now, you'll notice that the way I'm framing this is different from how I started, and that's intentional, because until now this problem has been quantified using mass: think kilograms, tons, hectograms, whatever your unit of choice is in mass.
Why do we talk about food in terms of weight?
Because it's easy.
We can look at a photograph and determine tonnage on a ship by using a simple pocket calculator.
We can weigh trucks, airplanes and oxcarts.
But what we care about in food is nutritional value.
Not all foods are created equal, even if they weigh the same.
This I learned firsthand when I moved from Ethiopia to the US for university.
Upon my return back home, my father, who was so excited to see me, greeted me by asking why I was fat.
Now, turns out that eating approximately the same amount of food as I did in Ethiopia, but in America, had actually lent a certain fullness to my figure.
This is why we should care about calories, not about mass.
It is calories which sustain us.
So 214 trillion calories is a very large number, and not even the most dedicated of us think in the hundreds of trillions of calories.
So let me break this down differently.
An alternative way to think about this is to think about it in Big Macs. 214 trillion calories. A single Big Mac has 563 calories.
That means the world will be short 379 billion Big Macs in 2027.
That is more Big Macs than McDonald's has ever produced.
So how did we get to these numbers in the first place?
They're not made up.
This map shows you where the world was 40 years ago.
It shows you net calorie gaps in every country in the world.
Now, simply put, this is just calories consumed in that country minus calories produced in that same country.
This is not a statement on malnutrition or anything else.
It's simply saying how many calories are consumed in a single year minus how many are produced.
Blue countries are net calorie exporters, or self-sufficient.
They have some in storage for a rainy day.
Red countries are net calorie importers.
The deeper, the brighter the red, the more you're importing.
40 years ago, such few countries were net exporters of calories, I could count them with one hand.
Most of the African continent, Europe, most of Asia, South America excluding Argentina, were all net importers of calories.
And what's surprising is that China used to actually be food self-sufficient.
India was a big net importer of calories.
40 years later, this is today.
You can see the drastic transformation that's occurred in the world.
Brazil has emerged as an agricultural powerhouse.
Europe is dominant in global agriculture.
India has actually flipped from red to blue.
It's become food self-sufficient.
And China went from that light blue to the brightest red that you see on this map.
How did we get here? What happened? So this chart shows you India and Africa.
Blue line is India, red line is Africa.
How is it that two regions that started off so similarly in such similar trajectories take such different paths?
India had a green revolution.
Not a single African country had a green revolution. The net outcome? India is food self-sufficient and in the past decade has actually been exporting calories.
The African continent now imports over 300 trillion calories a year.
Then we add China, the green line.
Remember the switch from the blue to the bright red?
What happened and when did it happen?
China seemed to be on a very similar path to India until the start of the 21st century, where it suddenly flipped.
A young and growing population combined with significant economic growth made its mark with a big bang and no one in the markets saw it coming.
This flip was everything to global agricultural markets.
Luckily now, South America was starting to boom at the same time as China's rise, and so therefore, supply and demand were still somewhat balanced.
So the question becomes, where do we go from here? Oddly enough, it's not a new story, except this time it's not just a story of China.
It's a continuation of China, an amplification of Africa and a paradigm shift in India.
By 2023, Africa's population is forecasted to overtake that of India's and China's.
By 2023, these three regions combined will make up over half the world's population.
This crossover point starts to present really interesting challenges for global food security.
And a few years later, we're hit hard with that reality.
What does the world look like in 10 years?
So far, as I mentioned, India has been food self-sufficient.
Most forecasters predict that this will continue. We disagree. India will soon become a net importer of calories.
This will be driven both by the fact that demand is growing from a population growth standpoint plus economic growth.
It will be driven by both.
And even if you have optimistic assumptions around production growth, it will make that slight flip.
That slight flip can have huge implications.
Next, Africa will continue to be a net importer of calories, again driven by population growth and economic growth.
This is again assuming optimistic production growth assumptions.
Then China, where population is flattening out, calorie consumption will explode because the types of calories consumed are also starting to be higher-calorie-content foods.
And so therefore, these three regions combined start to present a really interesting challenge for the world.
Until now, countries with calorie deficits have been able to meet these deficits by importing from surplus regions.
By surplus regions, I'm talking about North America, South America and Europe.
This line chart over here shows you the growth and the projected growth over the next decade of production from North America, South America and Europe.
What it doesn't show you is that most of this growth is actually going to come from South America.
And most of this growth is going to come at the huge cost of deforestation.
North America, South America and Europe. And so when you look at the combined demand increase coming from India, China and the African continent, and look at it versus the combined increase in production coming from India, China, the African continent, you are left with a 214-trillion-calorie deficit, one we can't produce.
And this, by the way, is actually assuming we take all the extra calories produced in North America, South America and Europe and export them solely to India, China and Africa.
What I just presented to you is a vision of an impossible world.
We can do something to change that.
We can change consumption patterns, we can reduce food waste, or we can make a bold commitment to increasing yields exponentially.
Now, I'm not going to go into discussing changing consumption patterns or reducing food waste, because those conversations have been going on for some time now. Nothing has happened. Nothing has happened because those arguments ask the surplus regions to change their behavior on behalf of deficit regions.
Waiting for others to change their behavior on your behalf, for your survival, is a terrible idea. It's unproductive.
So I'd like to suggest an alternative that comes from the red regions.
China, India, Africa.
China is constrained in terms of how much more land it actually has available for agriculture, and it has massive water resource availability issues.
So the answer really lies in India and in Africa.
India has some upside in terms of potential yield increases.
Now this is the gap between its current yield and the theoretical maximum yield it can achieve.
It has some unfarmed arable land remaining, but not much, India is quite land-constrained.
Now, the African continent, on the other hand, has vast amounts of arable land remaining and significant upside potential in yields.
Somewhat simplified picture here, but if you look at sub-Saharan African yields in corn today, they are where North American yields were in 1940.
We don't have 70-plus years to figure this out, so it means we need to try something new and we need to try something different.
The solution starts with reforms.
We need to reform and commercialize the agricultural industries in Africa and in India.
Now, by commercialization -- commercialization is not about commercial farming alone.
Commercialization is about leveraging data to craft better policies, to improve infrastructure, to lower the transportation costs and to completely reform banking and insurance industries.
Commercialization is about taking agriculture from too risky an endeavor to one where fortunes can be made.
Commercialization is not about just farmers.
Commercialization is about the entire agricultural system.
But commercialization also means confronting the fact that we can no longer place the burden of growth on small-scale farmers alone, and accepting that commercial farms and the introduction of commercial farms could provide certain economies of scale that even small-scale farmers can leverage.
It is not about small-scale farming or commercial agriculture, or big agriculture.
We can create the first successful models of the coexistence and success of small-scale farming alongside commercial agriculture.
This is because, for the first time ever, the most critical tool for success in the industry -- data and knowledge -- is becoming cheaper by the day.
And very soon, it won't matter how much money you have or how big you are to make optimal decisions and maximize probability of success in reaching your intended goal.
Companies like Gro are working really hard to make this a reality.
So if we can commit to this new, bold initiative, to this new, bold change, not only can we solve the 214-trillion gap that I talked about, but we can actually set the world on a whole new path.
India can remain food self-sufficient and Africa can emerge as the world's next dark blue region.
The new question is, how do we produce 214 trillion calories to feed 8.3 billion people by 2027? We have the solution.
We just need to act on it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
A long time ago, I was a professional animator.
(Music)
[Eric Dyer]
And at night, I would make my own experimental films.
(Music)
And I was spending a lot of time, way too much time, in front of a screen for work that would be presented on a screen, and I had this great need to get my hands back on the work again.
Now, before "The Simpsons," before "Gumby," before "Betty Boop," before there was such a thing as cinema and television, animation was hugely popular in this form.
This is a zoetrope.
And you spin this drum, and you look through the slits into the inside of the drum, and you see the animation pop to life.
This is animation in physical form, and it's animation I could get my hands on again.
I took these ideas to Denmark.
I went there with my family on a Fulbright Fellowship.
That's my daughter, Mia.
I rode around the city on my bicycle and shot all the interesting moving elements of Copenhagen: the boaters in the canals, the colors that explode in spring, the free-use city bikes, love, textures, the healthy cuisine --
(Laughter)
And I brought all that video back into the physical world by printing it out on these long strips of ink-jet paper and cutting out the forms.
Now, I invented my own form of the zoetrope, which removes the drum and replaces the slits with a video camera.
And this was very exciting for me, because it meant that I could make these physical objects, and I could make films from those objects.
That's me riding on my bicycle.
(Laughter)
I made about 25 paper sculptures, each the size of a bicycle wheel.
I brought them into the studio, spun them and shot them to make the film "Copenhagen Cycles."
(Music)
This project not only allowed me to get my hands back on the work again but it helped me get my life back.
Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day with my face plastered to a screen, I was having these little adventures with our new family and shooting video along the way, and it was kind of a symbiosis of art and life.
And I think that it's no mistake that zoetrope translates into "wheel of life."
(Music)
But film and video does flatten sculpture, so I tried to imagine a way that animated sculpture could be experienced as such, and also a completely immersive kind of animated sculpture.
And that's where I came up with the idea for the zoetrope tunnel.
You walk through with a handheld strobe, and wherever you point the flashlight, the animation pops to life.
I plan to finish this project in the next 30 to 40 years.
(Laughter)
But I did build a half-scale prototype.
It's covered in Velcro, and I could lay inside on this bridge and stick animated sequences to the walls and test stuff out.
People would comment that it reminded them of an MRI.
And that medical connection spoke to me, because at the age of 14, I was diagnosed with a degenerative retinal condition that's slowly taking my vision away, and I'd never responded to that in my work.
So I responded to it in this piece called, "Implant." It is an imaginary, super-magnified medical device that fits around the optic nerve.
And the public is, in a sense, miniaturized to experience it.
With a handheld strobe, they can explore the sculpture, and discover thousands of cell-sized robots hard at work, leaping in and out of the optic nerve, being deployed to the retina to repair it.
It's my science fiction fantasy cure of my own incurable disorder.
Now, in the real-world gene therapy and gene therapy research, healthy genes are being administered to unhealthy cells using viruses.
There's a lot of colorful, fluffy hope in this, and there's also some creepy, threatening idea of viruses maybe becoming an invasive species in your body.
Vision loss has helped to take me away from the things that disconnect me from the world.
Instead of being sealed off in an automobile, I ride my bike, take buses and trains and walk a lot.
And instead of a visually intensive process in the studio, primarily, I'm also getting outdoors a lot more and using more of my senses.
This landscape is a couple hours east of San Diego, California.
My brother lives out that way.
He and I went camping there for four days.
And I grabbed my camera, and I walked through the canyons.
And I tried to imagine and figure out what kind of motion would be present in this place that was so still and so devoid of motion.
I think it's the stillest place I've ever been.
And I realized that it was the movement of my own body through the landscape that was creating the animation.
It was the motion of changing perspective.
So I created this piece called "Mud Caves" from those photographs.
It's a multilayered print piece, and you can think of it as a zoetrope laid flat.
It's kind of my western landscape panorama.
And next to the print piece there's a video monitor that shows the animation hidden within the artwork.
I think one of the best parts about this project for me was that I got to hang out with my brother a lot, who lives 2,500 miles away from me.
And we would just sit in this seemingly eternal landscape sculpted by water over millions of years and talk.
We'd talk about our kids growing up and the slowing pace of our parents, and our dad who's suffering from leukemia, memory loss and infection.
And it struck me that, as individuals, we're finite, but as a family, we are an ongoing cycle -- a kind of wheel of life.
Now, I want to leave you with a tribute to one of my mentors.
She reminds me that physical presence is important and that play is not a luxury, but a necessity.
She's Pixie, and she's our family dog. And she loves to jump.
(Dog barking and spring boinging)
And this is a new kind of zoetrope that I developed at the Imaging Research Center at UMBC in Baltimore.
And I call it a "real-time zoetrope."
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Christiane, great to have you here.
So you've had this amazing viewpoint, and perhaps it's fair to say that in the last few years, there have been some alarming developments that you're seeing.
What's alarmed you most?
Christiane Amanpour: Well, just listening to the earlier speakers, I can frame it in what they've been saying: climate change, for instance -- cities, the threat to our environment and our lives.
It basically also boils down to understanding the truth and to be able to get to the truth of what we're talking about in order to really be able to solve it.
So if 99.9 percent of the science on climate is empirical, scientific evidence, but it's competing almost equally with a handful of deniers, that is not the truth; that is the epitome of fake news.
And so for me, the last few years -- certainly this last year -- has crystallized the notion of fake news in a way that's truly alarming and not just some slogan to be thrown around.
Because when you can't distinguish between the truth and fake news, you have a very much more difficult time trying to solve some of the great issues that we face.
CA: Well, you've been involved in this question of, what is balance, what is truth, what is impartiality, for a long time.
You were on the front lines reporting the Balkan Wars 25 years ago.
And back then, you famously said, by calling out human right abuses, you said, "Look, there are some situations one simply cannot be neutral about, because when you're neutral, you are an accomplice." So, do you feel that today's journalists aren't heeding that advice about balance?
CA: Well, look, I think for journalists, objectivity is the golden rule.
But I think sometimes we don't understand what objectivity means.
And I actually learned this very, very young in my career, which was during the Balkan Wars.
I was young then.
It was about 25 years ago.
And what we faced was the wholesale violation, not just of human rights, but all the way to ethnic cleansing and genocide, and that has been adjudicated in the highest war crimes court in the world.
So, we know what we were seeing.
Trying to tell the world what we were seeing brought us accusations of bias, of siding with one side, of not seeing the whole side, and just, you know, trying to tell one story.
I particularly and personally was accused of siding with, for instance, the citizens of Sarajevo -- "siding with the Muslims," because they were the minority who were being attacked by Christians on the Serb side in this area. And it worried me. It worried me that I was being accused of this.
I thought maybe I was wrong, maybe I'd forgotten what objectivity was.
But then I started to understand that what people wanted was actually not to do anything -- not to step in, not to change the situation, not to find a solution.
And so, their fake news at that time, their lie at that time -- including our government's, our democratically elected government's, with values and principles of human rights -- their lie was to say that all sides are equally guilty, that this has been centuries of ethnic hatred, whereas we knew that wasn't true, that one side had decided to kill, slaughter and ethnically cleanse another side.
So that is where, for me, I understood that objectivity means giving all sides an equal hearing and talking to all sides, but not treating all sides equally, not creating a forced moral equivalence or a factual equivalence.
And when you come up against that crisis point in situations of grave violations of international and humanitarian law, if you don't understand what you're seeing, if you don't understand the truth and if you get trapped in the fake news paradigm, then you are an accomplice.
And I refuse to be an accomplice to genocide.
CH: So there have always been these propaganda battles, and you were courageous in taking the stand you took back then.
Today, there's a whole new way, though, in which news seems to be becoming fake. How would you characterize that?
CA: Well, look -- I am really alarmed.
And everywhere I look, you know, we're buffeted by it.
Obviously, when the leader of the free world, when the most powerful person in the entire world, which is the president of the United States -- this is the most important, most powerful country in the whole world, economically, militarily, politically in every which way -- and it seeks to, obviously, promote its values and power around the world.
So we journalists, who only seek the truth -- I mean, that is our mission -- we go around the world looking for the truth in order to be everybody's eyes and ears, people who can't go out in various parts of the world to figure out what's going on about things that are vitally important to everybody's health and security.
So when you have a major world leader accusing you of fake news, it has an exponential ripple effect.
And what it does is, it starts to chip away at not just our credibility, but at people's minds -- people who look at us, and maybe they're thinking, "Well, if the president of the United States says that, maybe somewhere there's a truth in there."
CH: Presidents have always been critical of the media --
CA: Not in this way.
CH: So, to what extent --
CH: I mean, someone a couple years ago looking at the avalanche of information pouring through Twitter and Facebook and so forth, might have said, "Look, our democracies are healthier than they've ever been.
There's more news than ever.
Of course presidents will say what they'll say, but everyone else can say what they will say.
What's not to like?
How is there an extra danger? "
CA: So, I wish that was true. I wish that the proliferation of platforms upon which we get our information meant that there was a proliferation of truth and transparency and depth and accuracy.
But I think the opposite has happened.
You know, I'm a little bit of a Luddite, I will confess.
Even when we started to talk about the information superhighway, which was a long time ago, before social media, Twitter and all the rest of it, I was actually really afraid that that would put people into certain lanes and tunnels and have them just focusing on areas of their own interest instead of seeing the broad picture.
And I'm afraid to say that with algorithms, with logarithms, with whatever the "-ithms" are that direct us into all these particular channels of information, that seems to be happening right now.
I mean, people have written about this phenomenon.
People have said that yes, the internet came, its promise was to exponentially explode our access to more democracy, more information, less bias, more varied information.
And, in fact, the opposite has happened.
And so that, for me, is incredibly dangerous.
And again, when you are the president of this country and you say things, it also gives leaders in other undemocratic countries the cover to affront us even worse, and to really whack us -- and their own journalists -- with this bludgeon of fake news.
CH: To what extent is what happened, though, in part, just an unintended consequence, that the traditional media that you worked in had this curation-mediation role, where certain norms were observed, certain stories would be rejected because they weren't credible, but now that the standard for publication and for amplification is just interest, attention, excitement, click, "Did it get clicked on?" "Send it out there!" and that's what's -- is that part of what's caused the problem?
CA: I think it's a big problem, and we saw this in the election of 2016, where the idea of "clickbait" was very sexy and very attractive, and so all these fake news sites and fake news items were not just haphazardly and by happenstance being put out there, there's been a whole industry in the creation of fake news in parts of Eastern Europe, wherever, and you know, it's planted in real space and in cyberspace.
So I think that, also, the ability of our technology to proliferate this stuff at the speed of sound or light, just about -- we've never faced that before.
And we've never faced such a massive amount of information which is not curated by those whose profession leads them to abide by the truth, to fact-check and to maintain a code of conduct and a code of professional ethics.
CH: Many people here may know people who work at Facebook or Twitter and Google and so on.
They all seem like great people with good intention -- let's assume that.
If you could speak with the leaders of those companies, what would you say to them?
CA: Well, you know what -- I'm sure they are incredibly well-intentioned, and they certainly developed an unbelievable, game-changing system, where everybody's connected on this thing called Facebook.
And they've created a massive economy for themselves and an amazing amount of income.
I would just say, "Guys, you know, it's time to wake up and smell the coffee and look at what's happening to us right now." Mark Zuckerberg wants to create a global community.
I want to know: What is that global community going to look like?
I want to know where the codes of conduct actually are.
Mark Zuckerberg said -- and I don't blame him, he probably believed this -- that it was crazy to think that the Russians or anybody else could be tinkering and messing around with this avenue.
And what have we just learned in the last few weeks?
That, actually, there has been a major problem in that regard, and now they're having to investigate it and figure it out.
Yes, they're trying to do what they can now to prevent the rise of fake news, but, you know, it went pretty unrestricted for a long, long time.
So I guess I would say, you know, you guys are brilliant at technology; let's figure out another algorithm. Can we not?
CH: An algorithm that includes journalistic investigation --
CA: I don't really know how they do it, but somehow, you know -- filter out the crap!
(Laughter)
And not just the unintentional --
(Applause)
but the deliberate lies that are planted by people who've been doing this as a matter of warfare for decades.
The Soviets, the Russians -- they are the masters of war by other means, of hybrid warfare.
And this is a -- this is what they've decided to do.
It worked in the United States, it didn't work in France, it hasn't worked in Germany.
During the elections there, where they've tried to interfere, the president of France right now, Emmanuel Macron, took a very tough stand and confronted it head on, as did Angela Merkel.
CH: There's some hope to be had from some of this, isn't there?
That the world learns.
We get fooled once, maybe we get fooled again, but maybe not the third time. Is that true?
CA: I mean, let's hope. But I think in this regard that so much of it is also about technology, that the technology has to also be given some kind of moral compass.
I know I'm talking nonsense, but you know what I mean.
CH: We need a filter-the-crap algorithm with a moral compass --
CA: There you go.
CH: I think that's good.
CA: No -- "moral technology." We all have moral compasses -- moral technology.
CH: I think that's a great challenge.
CA: You know what I mean.
CH: Talk just a minute about leadership.
You've had a chance to speak with so many people across the world.
I think for some of us -- I speak for myself, I don't know if others feel this -- there's kind of been a disappointment of: Where are the leaders?
So many of us have been disappointed -- Aung San Suu Kyi, what's happened recently, it's like, "No! Another one bites the dust." You know, it's heartbreaking.
(Laughter)
Who have you met who you have been impressed by, inspired by?
CA: Well, you talk about the world in crisis, which is absolutely true, and those of us who spend our whole lives immersed in this crisis -- I mean, we're all on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
So it's pretty stressful right now.
And you're right -- there is this perceived and actual vacuum of leadership, and it's not me saying it, I ask all these -- whoever I'm talking to, I ask about leadership.
I was speaking to the outgoing president of Liberia today, [Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,] who --
(Applause)
in three weeks' time, will be one of the very rare heads of an African country who actually abides by the constitution and gives up power after her prescribed term.
She has said she wants to do that as a lesson.
But when I asked her about leadership, and I gave a quick-fire round of certain names, I presented her with the name of the new French president, Emmanuel Macron.
And she said -- I said, "So what do you think when I say his name?" And she said, "Shaping up potentially to be a leader to fill our current leadership vacuum." I thought that was really interesting.
Yesterday, I happened to have an interview with him.
I'm very proud to say, I got his first international interview. It was great. It was yesterday. And I was really impressed.
I don't know whether I should be saying that in an open forum, but I was really impressed.
(Laughter)
And it could be just because it was his first interview, but -- I asked questions, and you know what? He answered them!
(Laughter)
There was no spin, there was no wiggle and waggle, there was no spend-five-minutes- to-come-back-to-the-point.
I didn't have to keep interrupting, which I've become rather renowned for doing, because I want people to answer the question.
And he answered me, and it was pretty interesting. And he said —
CH: Tell me what he said.
CA: No, no, you go ahead.
CA: No, no, go ahead.
CH: What'd he say?
CA: OK. You've talked about nationalism and tribalism here today.
I asked him, "How did you have the guts to confront the prevailing winds of anti-globalization, nationalism, populism when you can see what happened in Brexit, when you could see what happened in the United States and what might have happened in many European elections at the beginning of 2017?" And he said, "For me, nationalism means war.
We have seen it before, we have lived through it before on my continent, and I am very clear about that." So he was not going to, just for political expediency, embrace the, kind of, lowest common denominator that had been embraced in other political elections.
And he stood against Marine Le Pen, who is a very dangerous woman.
CH: Last question for you, Christiane.
Tell us about ideas worth spreading.
If you could plant one idea into the minds of everyone here, what would that be?
CA: I would say really be careful where you get your information from; really take responsibility for what you read, listen to and watch; make sure that you go to the trusted brands to get your main information, no matter whether you have a wide, eclectic intake, really stick with the brand names that you know, because in this world right now, at this moment right now, our crises, our challenges, our problems are so severe, that unless we are all engaged as global citizens who appreciate the truth, who understand science, empirical evidence and facts, then we are just simply going to be wandering along to a potential catastrophe.
So I would say, the truth, and then I would come back to Emmanuel Macron and talk about love.
I would say that there's not enough love going around.
And I asked him to tell me about love.
I said, "You know, your marriage is the subject of global obsession."
(Laughter)
"Can you tell me about love? What does it mean to you?" I've never asked a president or an elected leader about love. I thought I'd try it.
And he said — you know, he actually answered it.
And he said, "I love my wife, she is part of me, we've been together for decades." But here's where it really counted, what really stuck with me.
He said, "It is so important for me to have somebody at home who tells me the truth."
So you see, I brought it home.
It's all about the truth.
CH: So there you go. Truth and love. Ideas worth spreading.
Christiane Amanpour, thank you so much. That was great.
I'm a neuroscientist, and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains, and our mission is to train the next generation of neuroscientists by taking graduate-level neuroscience research equipment and making it available for kids in middle schools and high schools.
And so when we go into the classroom, one way to get them thinking about the brain, which is very complex, is to ask them a very simple question about neuroscience, and that is, "What has a brain?" When we ask that, students will instantly tell you that their cat or dog has a brain, and most will say that a mouse or even a small insect has a brain, but almost nobody says that a plant or a tree or a shrub has a brain.
And so when you push -- because this could actually help describe a little bit how the brain actually functions -- so you push and say, "Well, what is it that makes living things have brains versus not?" And often they'll come back with the classification that things that move tend to have brains.
And that's absolutely correct.
Our nervous system evolved because it is electrical.
It's fast, so we can quickly respond to stimuli in the world and move if we need to.
But you can go back and push back on a student, and say, "Well, you know, you say that plants don't have brains, but plants do move." Anyone who has grown a plant has noticed that the plant will move and face the sun.
But they'll say, "But that's a slow movement.
You know, that doesn't count.
That could be a chemical process. "But what about fast-moving plants?
Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs, the Royal Governor of North Carolina, made a pretty fascinating discovery.
In the swamps behind his house, he found a plant that would spring shut every time a bug would fall in between it.
He called this plant the flytrap, and within a decade, it made its way over to Europe, where eventually the great Charles Darwin got to study this plant, and this plant absolutely blew him away.
He called it the most wonderful plant in the world.
This is a plant that was an evolutionary wonder.
This is a plant that moves quickly, which is rare, and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.
And this is in the same plant.
But I'm here today to tell you that's not even the coolest thing about this plant. The coolest thing is that the plant can count.
So in order to show that, we have to get some vocabulary out of the way.
So I'm going to do what we do in the classroom with students.
We're going to do an experiment on electrophysiology, which is the recording of the body's electrical signal, either coming from neurons or from muscles.
And I'm putting some electrodes here on my wrists.
As I hook them up, we're going to be able to see a signal on the screen here.
And this signal may be familiar to you.
It's called the EKG, or the electrocardiogram.
And this is coming from neurons in my heart that are firing what's called action potentials, potential meaning voltage and action meaning it moves quickly up and down, which causes my heart to fire, which then causes the signal that you see here.
And so I want you to remember the shape of what we'll be looking at right here, because this is going to be important.
This is a way that the brain encodes information in the form of an action potential.
So now let's turn to some plants. So I'm going to first introduce you to the mimosa, not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica, and this is a plant that's found in Central America and South America, and it has behaviors.
And the first behavior I'm going to show you is if I touch the leaves here, you get to see that the leaves tend to curl up.
And then the second behavior is, if I tap the leaf, the entire branch seems to fall down. So why does it do that? It's not really known to science.
One of the reasons why could be that it scares away insects or it looks less appealing to herbivores. But how does it do that? Now, that's interesting.
We can do an experiment to find out.
So what we're going to do now, just like I recorded the electrical potential from my body, we're going to record the electrical potential from this plant, this mimosa.
And so what we're going to do is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem, and I've got the ground electrode where? In the ground. It's an electrical engineering joke. Alright.
Alright. So I'm going to go ahead and tap the leaf here, and I want you to look at the electrical recording that we're going to see inside the plant. Whoa. It is so big, I've got to scale it down. Alright. So what is that?
That is an action potential that is happening inside the plant.
Why was it happening?
Because it wanted to move. Right? And so when I hit the touch receptors, it sent a voltage all the way down to the end of the stem, which caused it to move.
And now, in our arms, we would move our muscles, but the plant doesn't have muscles.
What it has is water inside the cells and when the voltage hits it, it opens up, releases the water, changes the shape of the cells, and the leaf falls.
OK. So here we see an action potential encoding information to move. Alright? But can it do more? So let's go to find out. We're going to go to our good friend, the Venus flytrap here, and we're going to take a look at what happens inside the leaf when a fly lands on here.
So I'm going to pretend to be a fly right now.
And now here's my Venus flytrap, and inside the leaf, you're going to notice that there are three little hairs here, and those are trigger hairs.
And so when a fly lands -- I'm going to touch one of the hairs right now. Ready? One, two, three. What do we get? We get a beautiful action potential.
However, the flytrap doesn't close.
And to understand why that is, we need to know a little bit more about the behavior of the flytrap.
Number one is that it takes a long time to open the traps back up -- you know, about 24 to 48 hours if there's no fly inside of it.
And so it takes a lot of energy.
And two, it doesn't need to eat that many flies throughout the year. Only a handful. It gets most of its energy from the sun.
It's just trying to replace some nutrients in the ground with flies.
And the third thing is, it only opens then closes the traps a handful of times until that trap dies.
So therefore, it wants to make really darn sure that there's a meal inside of it before the flytrap snaps shut. So how does it do that? It counts the number of seconds between successive touching of those hairs.
And so the idea is that there's a high probability, if there's a fly inside of there, they're going to be quick together, and so when it gets the first action potential, it starts counting, one, two, and if it gets to 20 and it doesn't fire again, then it's not going to close, but if it does it within there, then the flytrap will close.
So we're going to go back now.
I'm going to touch the Venus flytrap again. I've been talking for more than 20 seconds.
So we can see what happens when I touch the hair a second time. So what do we get? We get a second action potential, but again, the leaf doesn't close.
So now if I go back in there and if I'm a fly moving around, I'm going to be touching the leaf a few times.
I'm going to go and brush it a few times.
And immediately, the flytrap closes.
So here we are seeing the flytrap actually doing a computation.
It's determining if there's a fly inside the trap, and then it closes.
So let's go back to our original question. Do plants have brains?
Well, the answer is no.
There's no brains in here. There's no axons, no neurons. It doesn't get depressed.
It doesn't want to know what the Tigers' score is. It doesn't have self-actualization problems.
But what it does have is something that's very similar to us, which is the ability to communicate using electricity.
It just uses slightly different ions than we do, but it's actually doing the same thing.
So just to show you the ubiquitous nature of these action potentials, we saw it in the Venus flytrap, we've seen an action potential in the mimosa.
We've even seen an action potential in a human.
Now, this is the euro of the brain.
It's the way that all information is passed.
And so what we can do is we can use those action potentials to pass information between species of plants.
And so this is our interspecies plant-to-plant communicator, and what we've done is we've created a brand new experiment where we're going to record the action potential from a Venus flytrap, and we're going to send it into the sensitive mimosa.
So I want you to recall what happens when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.
It has touch receptors that are sending that information back down in the form of an action potential.
And so what would happen if we took the action potential from the Venus flytrap and sent it into all the stems of the mimosa?
We should be able to create the behavior of the mimosas without actually touching it ourselves.
And so if you'll allow me, I'm going to go ahead and trigger this mimosa right now by touching on the hairs of the Venus flytrap.
So we're going to send information about touch from one plant to another.
So there you see it. So --
(Applause)
So I hope you learned a little bit, something about plants today, and not only that. You learned that plants could be used to help teach neuroscience and bring along the neurorevolution.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'd like to take you back about seven years in my life.
Friday afternoon, a few days before Christmas 2009. I was the director of operations at a consumer products company in San Francisco, and I was called into a meeting that was already in progress.
That meeting turned out to be my exit interview.
I was fired, along with several others.
I was 64 years old at the time.
It wasn't completely unexpected.
I signed a stack of papers, gathered my personal effects, and left to join my wife who was waiting for me at a nearby restaurant, completely unaware.
Fast-forward several hours, we both got really silly drunk.
(Laughter)
So, 40 plus years of continuous employment for a variety of companies, large and small, was over.
I had a good a network, a good reputation -- I thought I'd be just fine.
I was an engineer in manufacturing and packaging. I had a good background.
Retirement was, like for so many people, simply not an option for me, so I turned to consulting for the next couple of years without any passion whatsoever.
And then an idea began to take root, born from my concern for our environment.
I wanted to build my own business, designing and manufacturing biodegradable packaging from waste -- paper, agricultural, even textile waste -- replacing the toxic, disposable plastic packaging to which we've all become addicted.
This is called clean technology, and it felt really meaningful to me.
A venture that could help to reduce the billions of pounds of single-use plastic packaging dumped each year and polluting our land, our rivers and our oceans, and left for future generations to resolve -- our grandchildren, my grandchildren.
And so now at the age of 66, with 40 years of experience, I became an entrepreneur for the very first time.
(Cheers)
(Applause)
Thank you. But there's more.
Lots of issues to deal with: manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation, patents, partnerships, funding -- these are all typical issues for a start-up, but hardly typical for me.
And a word about funding.
I live and work in San Francisco, and if you're looking for funding, you are typically going to compete with some very young people from the high-tech industry, and it can be very discouraging and intimidating.
I have shoes older than most of these people.
(Laughter)
I do.
(Laughter)
But five years later, I'm thrilled and proud to share with you that our revenues have doubled every year, we have no debt, we have several marquee clients, our patent was issued, I have a wonderful partner who's been with me right from the beginning, and we've won more than 20 awards for the work that we've done.
But best of all, we've made a small dent -- a very small dent -- in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis.
(Applause)
And I am doing the most rewarding and meaningful work of my life right now.
I can tell you there's lots of resources available to entrepreneurs of all ages, but what I really yearned for five years ago was to find other first-time entrepreneurs who were my age.
I wanted to connect with them.
I had no role models, absolutely none.
That 20-something app developer from Silicon Valley was not my role model.
(Laughter)
I'm sure he was very clever --
(Laughter) I want to do something about that, and I want all of us to do something about that.
I want us to start talking more about people who don't become entrepreneurs until they are seniors.
Talking about these bold men and women who are checking in when their peers, in essence, are checking out.
And then connecting all these people across industries, across regions, across countries -- building a community.
You know, the Small Business Administration tells us that 64 percent of new jobs created in the private sector in the USA are thanks to small businesses like mine.
And who's to say that we'll stay forever small?
We have an interesting culture that really expects when you reach a certain age, you're going to be golfing, or playing checkers, or babysitting the grandkids all of the time.
And I adore my grandchildren —
(Laughter)
and I'm also passionate about doing something meaningful in the global marketplace.
And I'm going to have lots of company.
The Census Bureau says that by 2050, there will be 84 million seniors in this country.
That's an amazing number.
That's almost twice as many as we have today.
Can you imagine how many first-time entrepreneurs there will be among 84 million people?
And they'll all have four decades of experience.
(Laughter) So when I say, "Let's start talking more about these wonderful entrepreneurs," I mean, let's talk about their ventures, just as we do the ventures of their much younger counterparts.
The older entrepreneurs in this country have a 70 percent success rate starting new ventures.
70 percent success rate.
We're like the Golden State Warriors of entrepreneurs --
(Laughter)
(Applause) And that number plummets to 28 percent for younger entrepreneurs.
This is according to a UK-based group called CMI.
Aren't the accomplishments of a 70-year-old entrepreneur every bit as meaningful, every bit as newsworthy, as the accomplishments of a 30-year-old entrepreneur?
Of course they are.
That's why I'd like to make the phrase "70 over 70" just as --
(Laughter)
just as commonplace as the phrase "30 under 30."
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Cheers) (Applause)
When was I was 21 years old, I had all this physics homework.
Physics homework requires taking breaks, and Wikipedia was relatively new, so I took a lot of breaks there.
I kept going back to the same articles, reading them again and again, on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland.
How cool would it be to visit these places and what would it take to do so?
Well, here we are on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane operated by NASA flying over the Greenland ice sheet.
There's a lot to see here, but there's more that is hidden, waiting to be uncovered.
What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me is that there's liquid water hidden inside the ice sheet, because we didn't know that yet.
I did learn on Wikipedia that the Greenland ice sheet is huge, the size of Mexico, and its ice from top to bottom is two miles thick.
But it's not just static.
The ice flows like a river downhill towards the ocean.
As it flows around bends, it deforms and cracks.
I get to study these amazing ice dynamics, which are located in one of the most remote physical environments remaining on earth.
To work in glaciology right now is like getting in on the ground floor at Facebook in the 2000s.
(Laughter)
Our capability to fly airplanes and satellites over the ice sheets is revolutionizing glaciology. It's just starting to do for science what the smartphone has done for social media.
The satellites are reporting a wealth of observations that are revealing new hidden facts about the ice sheets continuously.
For instance, we have observations of the size of the Greenland ice sheet every month going back to 2002.
You can look towards the bottom of the screen here to see the month and the year go forward.
You can see that some areas of the ice sheet melt or lose ice in the summer.
Other areas experience snowfall or gain ice back in the winter.
This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsed by an overall rate of mass loss that would have stunned a glaciologist 50 years ago.
We never thought that an ice sheet could lose mass into the ocean this quickly.
Since these measurements began in 2002, the ice sheet has lost so much ice that if that water were piled up on our smallest continent, it would drown Australia knee-deep. How is this possible? Well, under the ice lies the bedrock.
We used radar to image the hills, valleys, mountains and depressions that the ice flows over.
Hidden under the ice sheet are channels the size of the Grand Canyon that funnel ice and water off of Greenland and into the ocean.
The reason that radar can reveal the bedrock is that ice is entirely transparent to radar.
You can do an experiment. Go home and put an ice cube in the microwave.
It won't melt, because microwaves, or radar, pass straight through the ice without interacting.
If you want to melt your ice cube, you have to get it wet, because water heats up easily in the microwave.
That's the whole principle the microw ave oven is designed around.
Radar can see water.
And radar has revealed a vast pool of liquid water hidden under my colleague Olivia, seven stories beneath her feet.
Here, she's used a pump to bring some of that water back to the ice sheet's surface.
Just six years ago, we had no idea this glacier aquifer existed.
The aquifer formed when snow melts in the summer sun and trickles downward.
It puddles up in huge pools.
From there, the snow acts as an igloo, insulating this water from the cold and the wind above.
So the water can stay hidden in the ice sheet in liquid form year after year.
The question is, what happens next?
Does the water stay there forever? It could. Or does it find a way out to reach the global ocean?
One possible way for the water to reach the bedrock and from there the ocean is a crevasse, or a crack in the ice.
When cracks fill with water, the weight of the water forces them deeper and deeper.
This is how fracking works to extract natural gas from deep within the earth. Pressurized fluids fracture rocks.
All it takes is a crack to get started.
Well, we recently discovered that there are cracks available in the Greenland ice sheet near this glacier aquifer.
You can fly over most of the Greenland ice sheet and see nothing, no cracks, no features on the surface, but as this helicopter flies towards the coast, the path that water would take on its quest to flow downhill, one crack appears, then another and another.
Are these cracks filled with liquid water?
And if so, how deep do they take that water?
Can they take it to the bedrock and the ocean?
To answer these questions, we need something beyond remote sensing data.
We need numeric models.
I write numeric models that run on supercomputers.
A numeric model is simply a set of equations that works together to describe something.
It can be as simple as the next number in a sequence -- one, three, five, seven -- or it can be a more complex set of equations that predict the future based on known conditions in the present.
In our case, what are the equations for how ice cracks?
Well, engineers already have a very good understanding of how aluminum, steel and plastics fracture under stress.
It's an important problem in our society.
And it turns out that the engineering equations for how materials fracture are not that different from my physics homework.
So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice, and then I had a numeric model for how a crevasse can fracture when filled with water from the aquifer.
This is the power of math.
It can help us understand real processes in our world.
I'll show you now the results of my numeric model, but first I should point out that the crevasse is about a thousand times narrower than it is deep, so in the main panel here, we've zoomed in to better see the details.
You can look to the smaller panel on the right to see the true scale for how tall and skinny the crevasse is.
As the aquifer water flows into the crevasse, some of it refreezes in the negative 15 degree Celsius ice. That's about as cold as your kitchen freezer.
But this loss can be overcome if the flow rate in from the glacier aquifer is high enough.
In our case, it is, and the aquifer water drives the crevasse all the way to the base of the ice sheet a thousand meters below.
From there, it has a clear path to reach the ocean.
So the aquifer water is a part of the three millimeters per year of sea level rise that we experience as a global society.
But there's more: the aquifer water might be punching above its weight.
The ice flows in complex ways.
In some places, the ice flows very fast.
There tends to be water at the base of the ice sheet here.
In other places, not so fast. Usually, there's not water present at the base there.
Now that we know the aquifer water is getting to the base of the ice sheet, the next question is: Is it making the ice itself flow faster into the ocean?
We're trying to uncover these mysteries hidden inside the Greenland ice sheet so that we can better plan for the sea level rise it holds.
The amount of ice that Greenland has lost since 2002 is just a small fraction of what that ice sheet holds.
Ice sheets are immense, powerful machines that operate on long timescales.
In the next 80 years, global sea levels will rise at least 20 centimeters, perhaps as much as one meter, and maybe more.
Our understanding of future sea level rise is good, but our projections have a wide range.
It's our role as glaciologists and scientists to narrow these uncertainties.
How much sea level rise is coming, and how fast will it get here?
We need to know how much and how fast, so the world and its communities can plan for the sea level rise that's coming.
Thank you.
(Applause)
After decades of research and billions of dollars spent in clinical trials, we still have a problem with cancer drug delivery.
We still give patients chemotherapy, which is so non-specific that even though it kills the cancer cells, it kind of kills the rest of your body, too.
And yes, we have developed more selective drugs, but it's still a challenge to get them into the tumor, and they end up accumulating in the other organs as well or passing through your urine, which is a total waste.
And fields like mine have emerged where we try to encapsulate these drugs to protect them as they travel through the body.
But these modifications cause problems that we make more modifications to fix.
So what I'm really trying to say is we need a better drug delivery system.
And I propose, rather than using solely human design, why not use nature's?
Immune cells are these versatile vehicles that travel throughout our body, patrolling for signs of disease and arriving at a wound mere minutes after injury.
So I ask you guys: If immune cells are already traveling to places of injury or disease in our bodies, why not add an extra passenger?
Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs to cure some of our biggest problems in disease?
I am a biomedical engineer, and I want to tell you guys a story about how I use immune cells to target one of the largest problems in cancer.
Did you know that over 90 percent of cancer deaths can be attributed to its spread?
So if we can stop these cancer cells from going from the primary tumor to a distant site, we can stop cancer right in its tracks and give people more of their lives back.
To do this special mission, we decided to deliver a nanoparticle made of lipids, which are the same materials that compose your cell membrane.
And we've added two special molecules. One is called e-selectin, which acts as a glue that binds the nanoparticle to the immune cell. And the second one is called trail.
Trail is a therapeutic drug that kills cancer cells but not normal cells.
Now, when you put both of these together, you have a mean killing machine on wheels.
To test this, we ran an experiment in a mouse.
So what we did was we injected the nanoparticles, and they bound almost immediately to the immune cells in the bloodstream.
And then we injected the cancer cells to mimic a process through which cancer cells spread throughout our bodies.
And we found something very exciting.
We found that in our treated group, over 75 percent of the cancer cells we initially injected were dead or dying, in comparison to only around 25 percent. So just imagine: these fewer amount of cells were available to actually be able to spread to a different part of the body.
And this is only after two hours of treatment.
Our results were amazing, and we had some pretty interesting press.
My favorite title was actually, "Sticky balls may stop the spread of cancer."
(Laughter)
I can't tell you just how smug my male colleagues were, knowing that their sticky balls might one day cure cancer.
(Laughter)
But I can tell you they made some pretty, pretty, exciting, pretty ballsy t-shirts.
This was also my first experience talking to patients where they asked how soon our therapy would be available.
And I keep these stories with me to remind me of the importance of the science, the scientists and the patients.
Now, our fast-acting results were pretty interesting, but we still had one lingering question: Can our sticky balls, our particles actually attached to the immune cells, actually stop the spread of cancer?
So we went to our animal model, and we found three important parts.
Our primary tumors were smaller in our treated animals, there were fewer cells in circulation, and there was little to no tumor burden in the distant organs.
Now, this wasn't just a victory for us and our sticky balls.
This was also a victory to me in drug delivery, and it represents a paradigm shift, a revolution -- to go from just using drugs, just injecting them and hoping they go to the right places in the body, to using immune cells as special delivery drivers in your body.
For this example, we used two molecules, e-selectin and trail, but really, the possibility of drugs you can use are endless.
And I talked about cancer, but where disease goes, so do immune cells.
So this could be used for any disease.
Imagine using immune cells to deliver crucial wound-healing agents after a spinal cord injury, or using immune cells to deliver drugs past the blood-brain barrier to treat Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.
These are the ideas that excite me about science the most.
And from where I stand, I see so much promise and opportunity.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm often asked why I do art, what do I want to say with my art photography, and what is the use of it?
Once in a while I start to worry how to actually measure the impact from the art like we do with medicine or technology, where we can see the results and calculate it.
Then I would finally be able to explain to my mother my art with real numbers.
But my art is so far from metrics, and moreover, my photography is widely exposing the theme of escapism.
My theory is that all of us struggle sometimes to escape in order to analyze our reality, appreciate it or change.
I don't work with daily life as it is, and I'm not a documentary photographer in the common sense.
But I am a documentary photographer in a different sense. I document dreams. I work with daily life as it could be, as I imagine it.
I am a daydreamer, but at the same time I love things that are authentic and deal with our innermost nature, which I would never want to escape from.
I adore complicated personalities, and real life inspires me to create my images.
Real life inspires our escape, and sometimes that escape is very needed.
I believe heroes are not created easily, and I choose to work with individuals who are survivors and facing everyday routines that are not always full of color, people who are on their way to a better life, fighting against life circumstances.
Why do I choose people like that for my models?
Because I've been in that position myself, when I had to learn how to survive in real life.
I was a student living abroad in London.
I was working at two places at the same time as a waitress.
Obviously that wasn't my dream job, but I decided to play a game where I imagined that I am taking a role in a film, and in the film I am a waitress, and I need to act great.
I used to dye my hair and brows to gingerette, I changed my hair to curly perm, I lost weight and made myself believe I am just a character acting in a film.
That isn't forever, that is all just temporary.
That helped me a lot.
It motivated me to change my life and take a hard time as a game.
Now, as an artist, I am creating different lives for my models in order to give them the experience of being someone else in reality.
Through the photographic process, all of my models become like silent movie actors.
They are captured at the moment when they believe in being someone else entirely.
In order to create a new reality in its entirety, I physically create every single thing in my work, sometimes from outfits to the stage.
Because I work with analogues, and I don't make any digital manipulations to my photographs, I need everything to take place in reality, in spite of the fact that nowadays, digitally, you can create pretty much everything.
I don't like this path.
Even if that reaches perfection, I see the beauty in authenticity of making, and that's impossible without flaws.
A digitally manipulated photograph is not true for me.
It doesn't capture anything real.
It's not experienced, not motivating.
It's like, instead of going traveling, you look at someone else's travel photographs.
What I find so exciting is the ability to make people's dreams of being someone else a reality.
That's like a drug which pushes me to keep working, even without metrics.
One of my models had always dreamed of being seen as a warrior, but she wasn't able to do sports because of her health problems.
Half a year ago, she passed away from heart disease at the age of 22.
But two days before her death, the images we spent months working on together of her as a warrior she dreamed of becoming were published at a large exhibition in Milan by Vogue Magazine.
All her life was about overcoming.
Before she died, she had known that thousands of people saw her image from the land of escapism and believed in her as a brave and fearless warrior.
For my work, I invite people to play a game like we all used to as children when we pretend to be someone else and that process made us really happy.
To my mind it is important for grown-ups.
We need these transformations to enact this in the name of art.
It gives us the very real feeling of being important and powerful in order to influence our reality.
I know this from my own personal experience.
I have had so many versions of myself through my self-portraits that I've been many different characters.
Being someone else in the land of escapism doesn't exactly give us numbers that we can gauge, but it's like a real lost form of magic which exists but can't be measured.
There is a unique power in art to transform and lift our limits.
Art creates what I call a conjured life, which helps our existence and pushes, motivates and inspires us to dwell and express ourselves without metrics or calculations.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"Can you taste words?"
It was a question that caught me by surprise.
This summer, I was giving a talk at a literary festival, and afterwards, as I was signing books, a teenage girl came with her friend, and this is what she asked me.
I told her that some people experience an overlap in their senses so that they could hear colors or see sounds, and many writers were fascinated by this subject, myself included.
But she cut me off, a bit impatiently, and said, "Yeah, I know all of that.
It's called synesthesia.
We learned it at school.
But my mom is reading your book, and she says there's lots of food and ingredients and a long dinner scene in it.
She gets hungry at every page.
So I was thinking, how come you don't get hungry when you write?
And I thought maybe, maybe you could taste words.
Does it make sense?"
And, actually, it did make sense, because ever since my childhood, each letter in the alphabet has a different color, and colors bring me flavors.
So for instance, the color purple is quite pungent, almost perfumed, and any words that I associate with purple taste the same way, such as "sunset" -- a very spicy word.
But I was worried that if I tell all of this to the teenager, it might sound either too abstract or perhaps too weird, and there wasn't enough time anyhow, because people were waiting in the queue, so it suddenly felt like what I was trying to convey was more complicated and detailed than what the circumstances allowed me to say.
And I did what I usually do in similar situations: I stammered, I shut down, and I stopped talking.
I stopped talking because the truth was complicated, even though I knew, deep within, that one should never, ever remain silent for fear of complexity.
So I want to start my talk today with the answer that I was not able to give on that day.
Yes, I can taste words -- sometimes, that is, not always, and happy words have a different flavor than sad words.
I like to explore: What does the word "creativity" taste like, or "equality," "love," "revolution?"
And what about "motherland?" These days, it's particularly this last word that troubles me.
It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue, like cinnamon, a bit of rose water and golden apples.
But underneath, there's a sharp tang, like nettles and dandelion.
The taste of my motherland, Turkey, is a mixture of sweet and bitter.
And the reason why I'm telling you this is because I think there's more and more people all around the world today who have similarly mixed emotions about the lands they come from.
We love our native countries, yeah? How can we not? We feel attached to the people, the culture, the land, the food.
And yet at the same time, we feel increasingly frustrated by its politics and politicians, sometimes to the point of despair or hurt or anger.
I want to talk about emotions and the need to boost our emotional intelligence.
I think it's a pity that mainstream political theory pays very little attention to emotions.
Oftentimes, analysts and experts are so busy with data and metrics that they seem to forget those things in life that are difficult to measure and perhaps impossible to cluster under statistical models.
But I think this is a mistake, for two main reasons.
Firstly, because we are emotional beings.
As human beings, I think we all are like that.
But secondly, and this is new, we have entered a new stage in world history in which collective sentiments guide and misguide politics more than ever before.
And through social media and social networking, these sentiments are further amplified, polarized, and they travel around the world quite fast.
Ours is the age of anxiety, anger, distrust, resentment and, I think, lots of fear.
But here's the thing: even though there's plenty of research about economic factors, there's relatively few studies about emotional factors.
Why is it that we underestimate feelings and perceptions?
I think it's going to be one of our biggest intellectual challenges, because our political systems are replete with emotions.
In country after country, we have seen illiberal politicians exploiting these emotions.
And yet within the academia and among the intelligentsia, we are yet to take emotions seriously.
I think we should.
And just like we should focus on economic inequality worldwide, we need to pay more attention to emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide and how to bridge these gaps, because they do matter.
Years ago, when I was still living in Istanbul, an American scholar working on women writers in the Middle East came to see me.
And at some point in our exchange, she said, "I understand why you're a feminist, because, you know, you live in Turkey." And I said to her, "I don't understand why you're not a feminist, because, you know, you live in America."
(Laughter)
(Applause) And she laughed.
She took it as a joke, and the moment passed.
(Laughter)
But the way she had divided the world into two imaginary camps, into two opposite camps -- it bothered me and it stayed with me.
According to this imaginary map, some parts of the world were liquid countries. They were like choppy waters not yet settled.
Some other parts of the world, namely the West, were solid, safe and stable.
So it was the liquid lands that needed feminism and activism and human rights, and those of us who were unfortunate enough to come from such places had to keep struggling for these most essential values.
But there was hope.
Since history moved forward, even the most unsteady lands would someday catch up.
And meanwhile, the citizens of solid lands could take comfort in the progress of history and in the triumph of the liberal order.
They could support the struggles of other people elsewhere, but they themselves did not have to struggle for the basics of democracy anymore, because they were beyond that stage.
I think in the year 2016, this hierarchical geography was shattered to pieces.
Our world no longer follows this dualistic pattern in the scholar's mind, if it ever did.
Now we know that history does not necessarily move forward.
Sometimes it draws circles, even slides backwards, and that generations can make the same mistakes that their great-grandfathers had made.
And now we know that there's no such thing as solid countries versus liquid countries.
In fact, we are all living in liquid times, just like the late Zygmunt Bauman told us.
And Bauman had another definition for our age.
He used to say we are all going to be walking on moving sands.
And if that's the case, I think, it should concern us women more than men, because when societies slide backwards into authoritarianism, nationalism or religious fanaticism, women have much more to lose.
That is why this needs to be a vital moment, not only for global activism, but in my opinion, for global sisterhood as well.
(Applause)
But I want to make a little confession before I go any further.
Until recently, whenever I took part in an international conference or festival, I would be usually one of the more depressed speakers.
(Laughter)
Having seen how our dreams of democracy and how our dreams of coexistence were crushed in Turkey, both gradually but also with a bewildering speed, over the years I've felt quite demoralized.
And at these festivals there would be some other gloomy writers, and they would come from places such as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Philippines, China, Venezuela, Russia.
And we would smile at each other in sympathy, this camaraderie of the doomed.
(Laughter)
And you could call us WADWIC: Worried and Depressed Writers International Club.
(Laughter)
But then things began to change, and suddenly our club became more popular, and we started to have new members. I remember --
(Laughter)
I remember Greek writers and poets joined first, came on board.
And then writers from Hungary and Poland, and then, interestingly, writers from Austria, the Netherlands, France, and then writers from the UK, where I live and where I call my home, and then writers from the USA.
Suddenly, there were more of us feeling worried about the fate of our nations and the future of the world.
And maybe there were more of us now feeling like strangers in our own motherlands.
And then this bizarre thing happened.
Those of us who used to be very depressed for a long time, we started to feel less depressed, whereas the newcomers, they were so not used to feeling this way that they were now even more depressed.
(Laughter)
So you could see writers from Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt trying to console their colleagues from Brexit Britain or from post-election USA.
(Laughter)
But joking aside, I think our world is full of unprecedented challenges, and this comes with an emotional backlash, because in the face of high-speed change, many people wish to slow down, and when there's too much unfamiliarity, people long for the familiar.
And when things get too confusing, many people crave simplicity.
This is a very dangerous crossroads, because it's exactly where the demag ogue enters into the picture.
The demagogue understands how collective sentiments work and how he -- it's usually a he -- can benefit from them.
He tells us that we all belong in our tribes, and he tells us that we will be safer if we are surrounded by sameness.
Demagogues come in all sizes and in all shapes.
This could be the eccentric leader of a marginal political party somewhere in Europe, or an Islamist extremist imam preaching dogma and hatred, or it could be a white supremacist Nazi-admiring orator somewhere else.
All these figures, at first glance -- they seem disconnected.
But I think they feed each other, and they need each other.
And all around the world, when we look at how demagogues talk and how they inspire movements, I think they have one unmistakable quality in common: they strongly, strongly dislike plurality.
They cannot deal with multiplicity.
Adorno used to say, "Intolerance of ambiguity is the sign of an authoritarian personality." But I ask myself: What if that same sign, that same intolerance of ambiguity -- what if it's the mark of our times, of the age we're living in?
Because wherever I look, I see nuances withering away.
On TV shows, we have one anti-something speaker situated against a pro-something speaker. Yeah? It's good ratings.
It's even better if they shout at each other.
Even in academia, where our intellect is supposed to be nourished, you see one atheist scholar competing with a firmly theist scholar, but it's not a real intellectual exchange, because it's a clash between two certainties.
I think binary oppositions are everywhere.
So slowly and systematically, we are being denied the right to be complex.
Istanbul, Berlin, Nice, Paris, Brussels, Dhaka, Baghdad, Barcelona: we have seen one horrible terror attack after another.
And when you express your sorrow, and when you react against the cruelty, you get all kinds of reactions, messages on social media.
But one of them is quite disturbing, only because it's so widespread. They say, "Why do you feel sorry for them?
Why do you feel sorry for them?
Why don't you feel sorry for civilians in Yemen or civilians in Syria?"
And I think the people who write such messages do not understand that we can feel sorry for and stand in solidarity with victims of terrorism and violence in the Middle East, in Europe, in Asia, in America, wherever, everywhere, equally and simultaneously.
They don't seem to understand that we don't have to pick one pain and one place over all others.
But I think this is what tribalism does to us.
It shrinks our minds, for sure, but it also shrinks our hearts, to such an extent that we become numb to the suffering of other people.
And the sad truth is, we weren't always like this.
I had a children's book out in Turkey, and when the book was published, I did lots of events.
I went to many primary schools, which gave me a chance to observe younger kids in Turkey.
And it was always amazing to see how much empathy, imagination and chutzpah they have.
These children are much more inclined to become global citizens than nationalists at that age.
And it's wonderful to see, when you ask them, so many of them want to be poets and writers, and girls are just as confident as boys, if not even more.
But then I would go to high schools, and everything has changed.
Now nobody wants to be a writer anymore, now nobody wants to be a novelist anymore, and girls have become timid, they are cautious, guarded, reluctant to speak up in the public space, because we have taught them -- the family, the school, the society -- we have taught them to erase their individuality.
I think East and West, we are losing multiplicity, both within our societies and within ourselves.
And coming from Turkey, I do know that the loss of diversity is a major, major loss.
Today, my motherland became the world's biggest jailer for journalists, surpassing even China's sad record.
And I also believe that what happened over there in Turkey can happen anywhere. It can even happen here.
So just like solid countries was an illusion, singular identities is also an illusion, because we all have a multiplicity of voices inside.
The Iranian, the Persian poet, Hafiz, used to say, "You carry in your soul every ingredient necessary to turn your existence into joy.
All you have to do is to mix those ingredients."
And I think mix we can.
I am an Istanbulite, but I'm also attached to the Balkans, the Aegean, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Levant.
I am a European by birth, by choice, the values that I uphold.
I have become a Londoner over the years.
I would like to think of myself as a global soul, as a world citizen, a nomad and an itinerant storyteller.
I have multiple attachments, just like all of us do.
And multiple attachments mean multiple stories.
As writers, we always chase stories, of course, but I think we are also interested in silences, the things we cannot talk about, political taboos, cultural taboos.
We're also interested in our own silences.
I have always been very vocal about and written extensively about minority rights, women's rights, LGBT rights.
But as I was thinking about this TED Talk, I realized one thing: I have never had the courage to say in a public space that I was bisexual myself, because I so feared the slander and the stigma and the ridicule and the hatred that was sure to follow.
But of course, one should never, ever, remain silent for fear of complexity.
(Applause)
And although I am no stranger to anxieties, and although I am talking here about the power of emotions -- I do know the power of emotions -- I have discovered over time that emotions are not limitless. You know? They have a limit.
There comes a moment -- it's like a tipping point or a threshold -- when you get tired of feeling afraid, when you get tired of feeling anxious.
And I think not only individuals, but perhaps nations, too, have their own tipping points.
So even stronger than my emotions is my awareness that not only gender, not only identity, but life itself is fluid.
They want to divide us into tribes, but we are connected across borders.
They preach certainty, but we know that life has plenty of magic and plenty of ambiguity.
And they like to incite dualities, but we are far more nuanced than that.
So what can we do? I think we need to go back to the basics, back to the colors of the alphabet.
The Lebanese poet Khalil Gibran used to say, "I learned silence from the talkative and tolerance from the intolerant and kindness from the unkind." I think it's a great motto for our times.
So from populist demagogues, we will learn the indispensability of democracy. And from isolationists, we will learn the need for global solidarity. And from tribalists, we will learn the beauty of cosmopolitanism and the beauty of diversity.
As I finish, I want to leave you with one word, or one taste.
The word "yurt" in Turkish means "motherland." It means "homeland." But interestingly, the word also means "a tent used by nomadic tribes." And I like that combination, because it makes me think homelands do not need to be rooted in one place.
They can be portable. We can take them with us everywhere.
And I think for writers, for storytellers, at the end of the day, there is one main homeland, and it's called "Storyland." And the taste of that word is the taste of freedom.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Now, Hegel -- he very famously said that Africa was a place without history, without past, without narrative.
Yet, I'd argue that no other continent has nurtured, has fought for, has celebrated its history more concertedly.
The struggle to keep African narrative alive has been one of the most consistent and hard-fought endeavors of African peoples, and it continues to be so.
The struggles endured and the sacrifices made to hold onto narrative in the face of enslavement, colonialism, racism, wars and so much else has been the underpinning narrative of our history.
And our narrative has not just survived the assaults that history has thrown at it.
We've left a body of material culture, artistic magistery and intellectual output.
We've mapped and we've charted and we've captured our histories in ways that are the measure of anywhere else on earth.
Long before the meaningful arrival of Europeans -- indeed, whilst Europe was still mired in its Dark Age -- Africans were pioneering techniques in recording, in nurturing history, forging revolutionary methods for keeping their story alive.
And living history, dynamic heritage -- it remains important to us.
We see that manifest in so many ways.
I'm reminded of how, just last year -- you might remember it -- the first members of the al Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine were indicted for war crimes and sent to the Hague. And one of the most notorious was Ahmad al-Faqi, who was a young Malian, and he was charged, not with genocide, not with ethnic cleansing, but with being one of the instigators of a campaign to destroy some of Mali's most important cultural heritage.
This wasn't vandalism; these weren't thoughtless acts.
One of the things that al-Faqi said when he was asked to identify himself in court was that he was a graduate, that he was a teacher.
Over the course of 2012, they engaged in a systematic campaign to destroy Mali's cultural heritage.
This was a deeply considered waging of war in the most powerful way that could be envisaged: in destroying narrative, in destroying stories.
The attempted destruction of nine shrines, the central mosque and perhaps as many as 4,000 manuscripts was a considered act.
They understood the power of narrative to hold communities together, and they conversely understood that in destroying stories, they hoped they would destroy a people.
But just as Ansar Dine and their insurgency were driven by powerful narratives, so was the local population's defense of Timbuktu and its libraries.
These were communities who've grown up with stories of the Mali Empire; lived in the shadow of Timbuktu's great libraries.
They'd listened to songs of its origin from their childhood, and they weren't about to give up on that without a fight.
Over difficult months of 2012, during the Ansar Dine invasion, Malians, ordinary people, risked their lives to secrete and smuggle documents to safety, doing what they could to protect historic buildings and defend their ancient libraries.
And although they weren't always successful, many of the most important manuscripts were thankfully saved, and today each one of the shrines that was damaged during that uprising have been rebuilt, including the 14th-century mosque that is the symbolic heart of the city.
It's been fully restored.
But even in the bleakest periods of the occupation, enough of the population of Timbuktu simply would not bow to men like al-Faqi.
They wouldn't allow their history to be wiped away, and anyone who has visited that part of the world, they will understand why, why stories, why narrative, why histories are of such importance. History matters. History really matters. And for peoples of African descent, who have seen their narrative systematically assaulted over centuries, this is critically important.
This is part of a recurrent echo across our history of ordinary people making a stand for their story, for their history.
Just as in the 19th century, enslaved peoples of African descent in the Caribbean fought under threat of punishment, fought to practice their religions, to celebrate Carnival, to keep their history alive.
Ordinary people were prepared to make great sacrifices, some even the ultimate sacrifice, for their history.
And it was through control of narrative that some of the most devastating colonial campaigns were crystallized.
It was through the dominance of one narrative over another that the worst manifestations of colonialism became palpable.
When, in 1874, the British attacked the Ashanti, they overran Kumasi and captured the Asantehene.
They knew that controlling territory and subjugating the head of state -- it wasn't enough.
They recognized that the emotional authority of state lay in its narrative and the symbols that represented it, like the Golden Stool.
They understood that control of story was absolutely critical to truly controlling a people.
And the Ashanti understood, too, and they never were to relinquish the precious Golden Stool, never to completely capitulate to the British. Narrative matters.
In 1871, Karl Mauch, a German geologist working in Southern Africa, he stumbled across an extraordinary complex, a complex of abandoned stone buildings.
And he never quite recovered from what he saw: a granite, drystone city, stranded on an outcrop above an empty savannah: Great Zimbabwe.
And Mauch had no idea who was responsible for what was obviously an astonishing feat of architecture, but he felt sure of one single thing: this narrative needed to be claimed.
He later wrote that the wrought architecture of Great Zimbabwe was simply too sophisticated, too special to have been built by Africans.
Mauch, like dozens of Europeans that followed in his footsteps, speculated on who might have built the city.
And one went as far as to posit, "I do not think that I am far wrong if I suppose that that ruin on the hill is a copy of King Solomon's Temple." And as I'm sure you know, Mauch, he hadn't stumbled upon King Solomon's Temple, but upon a purely African complex of buildings constructed by a purely African civilization from the 11th century onward.
But like Leo Frobenius, a fellow German anthropologist who speculated some years later, upon seeing the Nigerian Ife Heads for the very first time, that they must have been artifacts from the long-lost kingdom of Atlantis. He felt, just like Hegel, an almost instinctive need to rob Africa of its history.
These ideas are so irrational, so deeply held, that even when faced with the physical archaeology, they couldn't think rationally.
They could no longer see.
And like so much of Africa's relationship with Enlightenment Europe, it involved appropriation, denigration and control of the continent.
It involved an attempt to bend narrative to Europe's ends.
And if Mauch had really wanted to find an answer to his question, "Where did Great Zimbabwe or that great stone building come from?" he would have needed to begin his quest a thousand miles away from Great Zimbabwe, at the eastern edge of the continent, where Africa meets the Indian Ocean.
He would have needed to trace the gold and the goods from some of the great trading emporia of the Swahili coast to Great Zimbabwe, to gain a sense of the scale and influence of that mysterious culture, to get a picture of Great Zimbabwe as a political, cultural entity through the kingdoms and the civilizations that were drawn under its control.
For centuries, traders have been drawn to that bit of the coast from as far away as India and China and the Middle East.
And it might be tempting to interpret, because it's exquisitely beautiful, that building, it might be tempting to interpret it as just an exquisite, symbolic jewel, a vast ceremonial sculpture in stone.
But the site must have been a complex at the center of a significant nexus of economies that defined this region for a millennium.
This matters. These narratives matter. Even today, the fight to tell our story is not just against time.
It's not just against organizations like Ansar Dine.
It's also in establishing a truly African voice after centuries of imposed histories.
We don't just have to recolonize our history, but we have to find ways to build back the intellectual underpinning that Hegel denied was there at all.
We have to rediscover African philosophy, African perspectives, African history.
The flowering of Great Zimbabwe — it wasn't a freak moment.
It was part of a burgeoning change across the whole of the continent.
Perhaps the great exemplification of that was Sundiata Keita, the founder of the Mali Empire, probably the greatest empire that West Africa has ever seen.
Sundiata Keita was born about 1235, growing up in a time of profound flux.
He was seeing the transition between the Berber dynasties to the north, he may have heard about the rise of the Ife to the south and perhaps even the dominance of the Solomaic Dynasty in Ethiopia to the east.
And he must have been aware that he was living through a moment of quickening change, of growing confidence in our continent.
He must have been aware of new states that were building their influence from as far afield as Great Zimbabwe and the Swahili sultanates, each engaged directly or indirectly beyond the continent itself, each driven also to invest in securing their intellectual and cultural legacy.
He probably would have engaged in trade with these peer nations as part of a massive continental nexus of great medieval African economies.
And like all of those great empires, Sundiata Keita invested in securing his legacy through history by using story -- not just formalizing the idea of storytelling, but in building a whole convention of telling and retelling his story as a key to founding a narrative for his empire.
And these stories, in musical form, are still sung today.
Now, several decades after the death of Sundiata, a new king ascended the throne, Mansa Musa, its most famous emperor.
Now, Mansa Musa is famed for his vast gold reserves and for sending envoys to the courts of Europe and the Middle East.
He was every bit as ambitious as his predecessors, but saw a different kind of route of securing his place in history.
In 1324, Mansa Musa went on pilgrimage to Mecca, and he traveled with a retinue of thousands.
It's been said that 100 camels each carried 100 pounds of gold.
It's been recorded that he built a fully functioning mosque every Friday of his trip, and performed so many acts of kindness, that the great Berber chronicler, Ibn Battuta, wrote, "He flooded Cairo with kindness, spending so much in the markets of North Africa and the Middle East that it affected the price of gold into the next decade."
And on his return, Mansa Musa memorialized his journey by building a mosque at the heart of his empire.
And the legacy of what he left behind, Timbuktu, it represents one of the great bodies of written historical material produced by African scholars: about 700,000 medieval documents, ranging from scholarly works to letters, which have been preserved often by private households.
And at its peak, in the 15th and 16th centuries, the university there was as influential as any educational establishment in Europe, attracting about 25,000 students.
This was in a city of around 100,000 people.
It cemented Timbuktu as a world center of learning.
But this was a very particular kind of learning that was focused and driven by Islam.
And since I first visited Timbuktu, I've visited many other libraries across Africa, and despite Hegel's view that Africa has no history, not only is it a continent with an embarrassment of history, it has developed unrivaled systems for collecting and promoting it.
There are thousands of small archives, textile drum stores, that have become more than repositories of manuscripts and material culture.
They have become fonts of communal narrative, symbols of continuity, and I'm pretty sure that many of those European philosophers who questioned an African intellectual tradition must have, beneath their prejudices, been aware of the contribution of Africa's intellectuals to Western learning.
They must have known of the great North African medieval philosophers who had driven the Mediterranean.
They must have known about and been aware of that tradition that is part of Christianity, of the three wise men.
And in the medieval period, Balthazar, that third wise man, was represented as an African king.
And he became hugely popular as the third intellectual leg of Old World learning, alongside Europe and Asia, as a peer.
These things were well-known. These communities did not grow up in isolation.
Timbuktu's wealth and power developed because the city became a hub of lucrative intercontinental trade routes.
This was one center in a borderless, transcontinental, ambitious, outwardly focused, confident continent.
Berber merchants, they carried salt and textiles and new precious goods and learning down into West Africa from across the desert.
But as you can see from this map that was produced a little time after the life of Mansa Musa, there was also a nexus of sub-Saharan trade routes, along which African ideas and traditions added to the intellectual worth of Timbuktu and indeed across the desert to Europe.
symbols of continuity, Manuscripts and material culture, they have become fonts of communal narrative,
And I'm pretty sure that those European intellectuals who cast aspersions on our history, they knew fundamentally about our traditions.
And today, as strident forces like Ansar Dine and Boko Haram grow popular in West Africa, it's that spirit of truly indigenous, dynamic, intellectual defiance that holds ancient traditions in good stead.
When Mansa Musa made Timbuktu his capital, he looked upon the city as a Medici looked upon Florence: as the center of an open, intellectual, entrepreneurial empire that thrived on great ideas wherever they came from.
The city, the culture, the very intellectual DNA of this region remains so beautifully complex and diverse, that it will always remain, in part, located in storytelling traditions that derive from indigenous, pre-Islamic traditions.
The highly successful form of Islam that developed in Mali became popular because it accepted those freedoms and that inherent cultural diversity.
And the celebration of that complexity, that love of rigorously contested discourse, that appreciation of narrative, was and remains, in spite of everything, the very heart of West Africa.
have been rebuilt, And today, as the shrines and the mosque vandalized by Ansar Dine many of the instigators of their destruction have been jailed.
And we are left with powerful lessons, reminded once again of how our history and narrative have held communities together for millennia, how they remain vital in making sense of modern Africa.
And we're also reminded of how the roots of this confident, intellectual, entrepreneurial, outward-facing, culturally porous, tariff-free Africa was once the envy of the world.
But those roots, they remain.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I recognized the roles that were placed on me very early.
One persistent concept that I observed -- existing in our language, in our media -- was that women are not only supposed to have children, they are supposed to want to. This existed everywhere. It existed in the ways that adults spoke to me when they posed questions in the context of "when." "When you get married ..." "When you have kids ..." And these future musings were always presented to me like part of this American dream, but it always felt to me like someone else's dream.
You see, a value that I have always understood about myself was that I never wanted children.
And as a kid, when I would try to explain this, this disconnect between their roles and my values, they often laughed in the way that adults do at the absurdities of children.
And they would tell me knowingly, "You'll change your mind."
And people have been saying things like that to me my whole life.
Otherwise polite conversation can turn intrusive fast. "Does your husband know?"
(Laughter)
"Do your parents know?"
(Laughter) "Don't you want a family?" "Don't you want to leave anything behind?" And the primary buzzword when discussing childlessness, "That's selfish."
There are countless reasons a woman may have for choosing to abstain from motherhood, the majority of them not self-prioritizing.
But it is still socially acceptable to publicly vilify women as such, because none of these reasons have made it into the social narrative.
When I was little and learning about the inevitability of maternity, it was never explained to me the commonness of these factors that women consider, like the risk of passing on hereditary illness, the danger of having to stop life-saving medication for the duration of your pregnancy, concern about overpopulation, your access to resources, and the fact that there are 415,000 children in the foster-care system in the United States at any given time.
Reasons like these, many more, and the fact that I don't like to leave things of this magnitude to chance, all informed my decision to become surgically sterilized.
I began my research eagerly.
I wanted to fully understand all that was going to come with undergoing a tubal ligation, which is just another word for getting your tubes tied.
I wanted to know approval to aftermath, satisfaction rates, risks, statistics.
And at first, I was empowered.
You see, the way the narrative has always been taught to me, I would have thought that women who didn't want children were so rare, and then I learned one in five American women won't be having a biological child -- some by choice, some by chance.
(Applause)
But I was not alone.
But the more I read, the more disheartened I became.
I read women's stories, trying desperately to get this procedure.
I learned how common it was for women to exhaust their finances appealing to dozens of ob-gyns over many years, only to be turned down so many times, often with such blatant disrespect that they just gave up.
Women reported that medical practitioners were often condescending and dismissive of their motivations, being told things like, "Come back when you're married with a child." But women who did have children, who went to go get this procedure, were told they were too young, or they didn't have enough children, which is very interesting, because the legal requirements in my state for getting this kind of surgery were, "Be at least 21 years old," "appear of sound mind, acting of your own accord," and "have a 30-day waiting period." And I was perplexed that I could meet all of these legal requirements and still have to face a battle in the exam room for my bodily autonomy.
And it was daunting, but I was determined.
I remember I dressed so professionally to that first appointment.
(Laughter)
I sat up straight. I spoke clearly. I wanted to give that doctor every piece of evidence that I was not the date of birth in that file.
And I made sure to mention things like, "I just got my bachelor's degree and I'm applying to these doctoral programs, I'm going to study these things." And "my long-term partner has this kind of business," and "I've done research on this for months.
I understand everything about it, all the risks. "Because I needed the doctor to know that this was not a whim, not reactionary, not your 20-something looking to go out and party without fear of getting knocked up... (Laughter) that this supported something integral to who I was.
And I understand informed consent, so I fully expected to be reeducated on how it all worked, but ... At one point, the information being given to me started to feel agenda'd, interlaced with bias and inflated statistics.
The questions began to feel interrogative.
At first they were asking me questions that seemed to understand my situation better, and then it seemed like they were asking questions to try to trip me up.
I felt like I was on the witness stand, being cross-examined.
The doctor asked me about my partner. "How does he or she feel about all of this?" "Well, I've been with the same man for five years, and he fully supports any decision I make for my body." And he said, "Well, what happens in the future, if you change partners?
What happens when that person wants children?" And I didn't quite know how to react to that, because what I was hearing was this doctor tell me that I'm supposed to disregard everything I believe if a partner demands children.
So I told him not to worry about that.
My stance on childbearing has always been first date conversation.
(Laughter)
He then asks me to consider how "in 20 years, you could really come to regret this" ... as though I hadn't.
I told him, "OK, if I wake up one day and realize, you know, I wish I'd made a different decision back then, the truth is, I'd only removed a single path to parenthood.
I never needed biology to form family anyway."
(Applause)
And I would much rather deal with that any day than deal with one day waking up, realize I'd had a child that I didn't really want or was prepared to care for.
Because one of these affects only me.
The other affects a child, their development, their well-being --
(Applause)
and human beings are not to be gambled with.
He then tells me why no one was going to approve this procedure, certainly not he, because of a concept called medical paternalism, which allows him, as my well-informed provider, to make decisions for me ... based on his perception of my best interest, regardless of what I, as the patient, want or believe.
He takes this opportunity to step out and discuss my case with my potential surgeon, and through the door, I hear him describe me as a little girl.
I was so offended. I wanted to defend myself.
I wanted to explicitly explain to each one of these providers how they were treating me, that it was belittling and sexist, and I didn't have to take it.
But I did take it.
I swallowed every sharp word in my throat, clenched my jaw, and instead answered each one of their condescending questions and statements.
I had come here looking for objectivity and support and instead I felt dismissed and silenced, and I hated myself for it.
I hated that I was letting people disrespect me repeatedly.
But this was my one shot.
That was one of multiple consultations that I had to go to.
At one point, I had seen five or six medical professionals in the same hour.
The door to the exam room felt more like the door to a clown car.
There's my primary, there's his colleague, the director, OK.
It felt like I was asking them to infect me with smallpox instead of, I don't know, obtain birth control.
But I didn't waver, and I was persistent, and I eventually convinced one of them to allow the procedure.
"You'll change your mind." And even as I am in the room, signing the consent forms and getting the hormone shots and tying up loose ends ... my doctor is shaking his head in disapproval.
I never really understood how strongly this society clings to this role until I went through this.
I experienced firsthand, repeatedly, how people, be it medical providers, colleagues, strangers, were literally unable to separate me being a woman from me being a mother.
And I've always believed that having children was an extension of womanhood, not the definition.
I believe that a woman's value should never be determined by whether or not she has a child, because that strips her of her entire identity as an adult unto herself.
Women have this amazing ability to create life, but when we say that that is her purpose, that says that her entire existence is a means to an end.
It's so easy to forget the roles that society places on us are so much more than mere titles.
What about the weight that comes with them, the pressure to conform to these standards ... the fear associated with questioning them, and the desires that we cast aside to accept them?
There are many paths to happiness and fulfillment.
They all look very different, but I believe that every one is paved with the right to self-determination.
I want women to know that your choice to embrace or forego motherhood is not in any way tied to your worthiness or identity as spouses, as adults, or as women ... and there absolutely is a choice behind maternity, and it is yours and yours alone.
Thank you.

According to the UN, billions of people still live without an address.
The economist Hernando de Soto said, "Without an address, you live outside the law.
You might as well not exist." I'm here to tell you how my team and I are trying to change that.
If you go to an online map and look at a favela in Brazil or a township in South Africa, you'll see a few streets but a lot of empty space.
But if you flip to satellite view, there are thousands of people, homes and businesses in this vast, unmapped and unaddressed spaces.
In Ghana's capital, Accra, there are numbers and letters scrawled onto the sides of walls, where they piloted address systems but not finished them.
But these places, these unaddressed places, hold huge economic potential.
Here's why the issue of addressing stuck with me.
I worked in the music business for 10 years, and what you may not know about the music world is that every day, people struggle with the problems of addressing.
So from the musicians who have to find the gigs to the production companies who bring the equipment, everyone somehow always gets lost.
We even had to add someone to our schedules who was the person you called when you thought you'd arrived but then realized you hadn't.
And we had some pretty bad days, like in Italy, where a truck driver unloaded all the equipment an hour north of Rome, not an hour south of Rome, and a slightly worse day where a keyboard player called me and said, "Chris, don't panic, but we may have just sound-checked at the wrong people's wedding."
(Laughter)
So not long after the fated Rome event, I chatted this through with a friend of mine who is a mathematician, and we thought it was a problem we could do something about.
We thought, well, we could make a new system, but it shouldn't look like the old system.
We agreed that addresses were bad.
We knew we wanted something very precise, but GPS coordinates, latitude and longitude, were just too complicated.
So we divided the world into three-meter squares.
The world divides into around 57 trillion three-meter squares, and we found that there are enough combinations of three dictionary words that we could name every three-meter square in the world uniquely with just three words.
We used 40,000 words, so that's 40,000 cubed, 64 trillion combinations of three words, which is more than enough for the 57-trillion-odd three-meter squares, with a few spare.
So that's exactly what we did.
We divided the world into three-meter squares, gave each one a unique, three-word identifier -- what we call a three-word address.
(Laughter) So for example, right here, I'm standing at mustards-coupons-pinup,
but over here ... I'm standing at pinched- singularly-tutorial.
But we haven't just done this in English.
We thought it was essential that people should be able to use this system in their own language.
So far, we've built it into 14 languages, including French, Swahili and Arabic, and we're working on more now, like Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi.
But this idea can do a lot more than just get my musicians to their gigs on time.
If the 75 percent of countries that struggle with reliable addressing started using three-word addresses, there's a stack of far more important applications.
In Durban, South Africa, an NGO called Gateway Health have distributed 11,000 three-word address signs to their community, so the pregnant mothers, when they go into labor, can call the emergency services and tell them exactly where to pick them up from, because otherwise, the ambulances have often taken hours to find them.
In Mongolia, the National Post Service have adopted the system and are now doing deliveries to many people's houses for the first time.
The UN are using it to geotag photos in disaster zones so they can deliver aid to exactly the right place.
Even Domino's Pizza are using it in the Caribbean, because they haven't been able to find customers' homes, but they really want to get their pizza to them while its still hot.
Shortly, you'll be able to get into a car, speak the three words, and the car will navigate you to that exact spot.
In Africa, the continent has leapfrogged phone lines to go to mobile phones, bypassed traditional banks to go straight to mobile payments.
We're really proud that the post services of three African countries -- Nigeria, Djibouti and Côte d'Ivoire, have gone straight to adopting three-word addresses, which means that people in those countries have a really simple way to explain where they live, today.
For me, poor addressing was an annoying frustration, but for billions of people, it's a huge business inefficiency, severely hampers their infrastructure growth, and can cost lives.
We're on a mission to change that, three words at a time. Thank you.
(Applause)
Representatives from six European countries had come to Rome to sign the treaty that was to create the European Union. Europe was destroyed. A world war had emerged from Europe.
The human suffering was unbelievable and unprecedented.
Those men wanted to create a peaceful, democratic Europe, a Europe that works for its people.
And one of the many building blocks in that peace project was a common European market.
Already back then, they saw how markets, when left to themselves, can sort of slip into being just the private property of big businesses and cartels, meeting the needs of some businesses and not the needs of customers.
So from our very first day, in 1957, the European Union had rules to defend fair competition.
And that means competition on the merits, that you compete on the quality of your products, the prices you can offer, the services, the innovation that you produce.
That's competition on the merits.
You have a fair chance of making it on such a market.
And it's my job, as Commissioner for Competition, to make sure that companies who do business in Europe live by those rules.
But let's take a step back.
Why do we need rules on competition at all?
Why not just let businesses compete?
Isn't that also the best for us if they compete freely, since more competition drives more quality, lower prices, more innovation?
Well, mostly it is.
But the problem is that sometimes, for businesses, competition can be inconvenient, because competition means that the race is never over, the game is never won.
No matter how well you were doing in the past, there's always someone who are out there wanting to take your place.
So the temptation to avoid competition is powerful.
It's rooted in motives as old as Adam and Eve: in greed for yet more money, in fear of losing your position in the market and all the benefits it brings.
And when greed and fear are linked to power, you have a dangerous mix.
We see that in political life.
In part of the world, the mix of greed and fear means that those who get power become reluctant to give it back.
One of the many things I like and admire in our democracies are the norms that make our leaders hand over power when voters tell them to.
And competition rules can do a similar thing in the market, making sure that greed and fear doesn't overcome fairness.
Because those rules mean that companies cannot misuse their power to undermine competition.
Think for a moment about your car.
It has thousands of parts, from the foam that makes the seats to the electrical wiring to the light bulbs. And for many of those parts, the world's carmakers, they are dependent on only a few suppliers.
So it's hardly surprising that it is kind of tempting for those suppliers to come together and fix prices.
But just imagine what that could do to the final price of your new car in the market.
Except, it's not imaginary.
The European Commission has dealt with already seven different car parts cartels, and we're still investigating some.
Here, the Department of Justice are also looking into the market for car parts, and it has called it the biggest criminal investigation it has ever pursued. But without competition rules, there would be no investigation, and there would be nothing to stop this collusion from happening and the prices of your car to go up.
Yet it's not only companies who can undermine fair competition.
Governments can do it, too.
And governments do that when they hand out subsidies to just the favorite few, the selected.
They may do that when they hand out subsidies -- and, of course, all financed by taxpayers -- to companies. That may be in the form of special tax treatments, like the tax benefits that firms like Fiat, Starbucks and Apple got from some governments in Europe.
Those subsidies stop companies from competing on equal terms.
They can mean that the companies that succeed, well, they are the companies that got the most subsidy, the ones that are the best-connected, and not, as it should be, the companies that serve consumers the best.
So there are times when we need to step in to make sure that competition works the way it should.
By doing that, we help the market to work fairly, because competition gives consumers the power to demand a fair deal.
It means that companies know that if they cannot offer good prices or the service that's expected, well, the customers will go somewhere else.
And that sort of fairness is more important than we may sometimes realize.
Very few people think about politics all the time.
Some even skip it at election time.
But we are all in the market.
Every day, we are in the market.
And we don't want businesses to agree on prices in the back office.
We don't want them to divide the market between them.
We don't want one big company just to shut out competitors from ever showing us what they can do.
If that happens, well, obviously, we feel that someone has cheated us, that we are being ignored or taken for granted by the market.
And that may undermine not only our trust in the market but also our trust in the society.
In a recent survey, more than two-thirds of Europeans said that they had felt the effects of lack of competition: that the price for electricity was too high, that the price for the medicines they needed was too high, that they had no real choice if they wanted to travel by bus or by plane, or they got poor service from their internet provider.
In short, they found that the market didn't treat them fairly.
And that might seem like very small things, but they can give you this sense that the world isn't really fair.
And they see the market, which was supposed to serve everyone, become more like the private property of a few powerful companies.
The market is not the society.
Our societies are, of course, much, much more than the market.
But lack of trust in the market can rub off on society so we lose trust in our society as well.
And it may be the most important thing we have, trust.
We can trust each other if we are treated as equals.
If we are all to have the same chances, well, we all have to follow the same fundamental rules.
Of course, some people and some businesses are more successful than others, but we do not trust in a society if the prizes are handed out even before the contest begins.
And this is where competition rules come in, because when we make sure that markets work fairly, then businesses compete on the merits, and that helps to build the trust that we need as citizens to feel comfortable and in control, and the trust that allows our society to work.
Because without trust, everything becomes harder.
Just to live our daily lives, we need to trust in strangers, to trust the banks who keep our money, the builders who build our home, the electrician who comes to fix the wiring, the doctor who treats us when we're ill, not to mention the other drivers on the road, and everyone knows that they are crazy.
And yet, we have to trust them to do the right thing.
And the thing is that the more our societies grow, the more important trust becomes and the harder it is to build.
And that is a paradox of modern societies.
And this is especially true when technology changes the way that we interact.
Of course, to some degree, technology can help us to build trust in one another with ratings systems and other systems that enable the sharing economy.
But technology also creates completely new challenges when they ask us not to trust in other people but to trust in algorithms and computers.
Of course, we all see and share and appreciate all the good that new technology can do us.
It's a lot of good.
Autonomous cars can give people with disabilities new independence.
It can save us all time, and it can make a much, much better use of resources.
Algorithms that rely on crunching enormous amounts of data can enable our doctors to give us a much better treatment, and many other things.
But no one is going to hand over their medical data or step into a car that's driven by an algorithm unless they trust the companies that they are dealing with.
And that trust isn't always there.
Today, for example, less than a quarter of Europeans trust online businesses to protect their personal information.
But what if people knew that they could rely on technology companies to treat them fairly?
What if they knew that those companies respond to competition by trying to do better, by trying to serve consumers better, not by using their power to shut out competitors, say, by pushing their services far, far down the list of search results and promoting themselves?
What if they knew that compliance with the rules was built into the algorithms by design, that the algorithm had to go to competition rules school before they were ever allowed to work, that those algorithms were designed in a way that meant that they couldn't collude, that they couldn't form their own little cartel in the black box they're working in?
Together with regulation, competition rules can do that.
They can help us to make sure that new technology treats people fairly and that everyone can compete on a level playing field.
And that can help us build the trust that we need for real innovation to flourish and for societies to develop for citizens.
Because trust cannot be imposed. It has to be earned.
Since the very first days of the European Union, 60 years ago, our competition rules have helped to build that trust.
A lot of things have changed.
It's hard to say what those six representatives would have made of a smartphone.
But in today's world, as well as in their world, competition makes the market work for everyone.
And that is why I am convinced that real and fair competition has a vital role to play in building the trust we need to get the best of our societies, and that starts with enforcing our rules, actually just to make the market work for everyone.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.
Thank you, Commissioner. Margrethe Vestager: It was a pleasure.
BG: I want to ask you two questions.
The first one is about data, because I have the impression that technology and data are changing the way competition takes place and the way competition regulation is designed and enforced.
Can you maybe comment on that?
MV: Well, yes, it is definitely challenging us, because we both have to sharpen our tools but also to develop new tools.
When we were going through the Google responses to our statement of objection, we were going through 5.2 terabytes of data. It's quite a lot. So we had to set up new systems.
We had to figure out how to do this, because you cannot work the way you did just a few years ago.
So we are definitely sharpening up our working methods.
The other thing is that we try to distinguish between different kinds of data, because some data is extremely valuable and they will form, like, a barrier to entry in a market.
Other things you can just -- it loses its value tomorrow.
So we try to make sure that we never, ever underestimate the fact that data works as a currency in the market and as an asset that can be a real barrier for competition.
BG: Google. You fined them 2.8 billion euros a few months ago.
MV: No, that was dollars.
It's not so strong these days.
BG: Ah, well, depends on the --
(Laughter)
Google appealed the case. The case is going to court.
It will last a while.
Earlier, last year, you asked Apple to pay 13 billion in back taxes, and you have also investigated other companies, including European and Russian companies, not only American companies, by far.
Yet the investigations against the American companies are the ones that have attracted the most attention and they have also attracted some accusations.
You have been accused, essentially, of protectionism, of jealousy, or using legislation to hit back at American companies that have conquered European markets. "The Economist" just this week on the front page writes, "Vestager Versus The Valley." How do you react to that?
MV: Well, first of all, I take it very seriously, because bias has no room in law enforcement.
We have to prove our cases with the evidence and the facts and the jurisprudence in order also to present it to the courts.
The second thing is that Europe is open for business, but not for tax evasion.
(Applause)
The thing is that we are changing, and for instance, when I ask my daughters — they use Google as well — "Why do you do that?" They say, "Well, because it works.
It's a very good product. "They would never, ever, come up with the answer," It's because it's a US product. "It's just because it works.
And that is of course how it should be.
But just the same, it is important that someone is looking after to say, "Well, we congratulate you while you grow and grow and grow, but congratulation stops if we find that you're misusing your position to harm competitors so that they cannot serve consumers."
BG: It will be a fascinating case to follow.
Thank you for coming to TED.
I'm going to begin with a scary question: Are we headed toward a future without jobs?
The remarkable progress that we're seeing in technologies like self-driving cars has led to an explosion of interest in this question, but because it's something that's been asked so many times in the past, maybe what we should really be asking is whether this time is really different.
The fear that automation might displace workers and potentially lead to lots of unemployment goes back at a minimum 200 years to the Luddite revolts in England.
And since then, this concern has come up again and again.
I'm going to guess that most of you have probably never heard of the Triple Revolution report, but this was a very prominent report.
It was put together by a brilliant group of people -- it actually included two Nobel laureates -- and this report was presented to the President of the United States, and it argued that the US was on the brink of economic and social upheaval because industrial automation was going to put millions of people out of work.
Now, that report was delivered to President Lyndon Johnson in March of 1964.
So that's now over 50 years, and, of course, that hasn't really happened.
And that's been the story again and again.
This alarm has been raised repeatedly, but it's always been a false alarm.
And because it's been a false alarm, it's led to a very conventional way of thinking about this.
And that says essentially that yes, technology may devastate entire industries.
It may wipe out whole occupations and types of work.
But at the same time, of course, progress is going to lead to entirely new things.
So there will be new industries that will arise in the future, and those industries, of course, will have to hire people.
There'll be new kinds of work that will appear, and those might be things that today we can't really even imagine.
And that has been the story so far, and it's been a positive story.
It turns out that the new jobs that have been created have generally been a lot better than the old ones.
They have, for example, been more engaging.
They've been in safer, more comfortable work environments, and, of course, they've paid more.
So it has been a positive story.
That's the way things have played out so far.
But there is one particular class of worker for whom the story has been quite different.
For these workers, technology has completely decimated their work, and it really hasn't created any new opportunities at all.
And these workers, of course, are horses.
(Laughter)
So I can ask a very provocative question: Is it possible that at some point in the future, a significant fraction of the human workforce is going to be made redundant in the way that horses were?
Now, you might have a very visceral, reflexive reaction to that.
You might say, "That's absurd.
How can you possibly compare human beings to horses?" Horses, of course, are very limited, and when cars and trucks and tractors came along, horses really had nowhere else to turn.
People, on the other hand, are intelligent; we can learn, we can adapt.
And in theory, that ought to mean that we can always find something new to do, and that we can always remain relevant to the future economy.
But here's the really critical thing to understand.
The machines that will threaten workers in the future are really nothing like those cars and trucks and tractors that displaced horses.
The future is going to be full of thinking, learning, adapting machines.
And what that really means is that technology is finally beginning to encroach on that fundamental human capability -- the thing that makes us so different from horses, and the very thing that, so far, has allowed us to stay ahead of the march of progress and remain relevant, and, in fact, indispensable to the economy.
So what is it that is really so different about today's information technology relative to what we've seen in the past?
I would point to three fundamental things.
The first thing is that we have seen this ongoing process of exponential acceleration.
I know you all know about Moore's law, but in fact, it's more broad-based than that; it extends in many cases, for example, to software, it extends to communications, bandwidth and so forth.
But the really key thing to understand is that this acceleration has now been going on for a really long time.
In fact, it's been going on for decades.
If you measure from the late 1950s, when the first integrated circuits were fabricated, we've seen something on the order of 30 doublings in computational power since then.
That's just an extraordinary number of times to double any quantity, and what it really means is that we're now at a point where we're going to see just an extraordinary amount of absolute progress, and, of course, things are going to continue to also accelerate from this point.
So as we look forward to the coming years and decades, I think that means that we're going to see things that we're really not prepared for.
We're going to see things that astonish us.
The second key thing is that the machines are, in a limited sense, beginning to think.
And by this, I don't mean human-level AI, or science fiction artificial intelligence; I simply mean that machines and algorithms are making decisions.
They're solving problems, and most importantly, they're learning.
In fact, if there's one technology that is truly central to this and has really become the driving force behind this, it's machine learning, which is just becoming this incredibly powerful, disruptive, scalable technology.
One of the best examples I've seen of that recently was what Google's DeepMind division was able to do with its AlphaGo system.
Now, this is the system that was able to beat the best player in the world at the ancient game of Go.
Now, at least to me, there are two things that really stand out about the game of Go.
One is that as you're playing the game, the number of configurations that the board can be in is essentially infinite.
There are actually more possibilities than there are atoms in the universe.
So what that means is, you're never going to be able to build a computer to win at the game of Go the way chess was approached, for example, which is basically to throw brute-force computational power at it.
So clearly, a much more sophisticated, thinking-like approach is needed.
The second thing that really stands out is that, if you talk to one of the championship Go players, this person cannot necessarily even really articulate what exactly it is they're thinking about as they play the game.
It's often something that's very intuitive, it's almost just like a feeling about which move they should make.
So given those two qualities, I would say that playing Go at a world champion level really ought to be something that's safe from automation, and the fact that it isn't should really raise a cautionary flag for us.
And the reason is that we tend to draw a very distinct line, and on one side of that line are all the jobs and tasks that we perceive as being on some level fundamentally routine and repetitive and predictable.
And we know that these jobs might be in different industries, they might be in different occupations and at different skill levels, but because they are innately predictable, we know they're probably at some point going to be susceptible to machine learning, and therefore, to automation.
And make no mistake -- that's a lot of jobs.
That's probably something on the order of roughly half the jobs in the economy.
But then on the other side of that line, we have all the jobs that require some capability that we perceive as being uniquely human, and these are the jobs that we think are safe.
Now, based on what I know about the game of Go, I would've guessed that it really ought to be on the safe side of that line.
But the fact that it isn't, and that Google solved this problem, suggests that that line is going to be very dynamic.
It's going to shift, and it's going to shift in a way that consumes more and more jobs and tasks that we currently perceive as being safe from automation.
The other key thing to understand is that this is by no means just about low-wage jobs or blue-collar jobs, or jobs and tasks done by people that have relatively low levels of education.
There's lots of evidence to show that these technologies are rapidly climbing the skills ladder.
So we already see an impact on professional jobs — tasks done by people like accountants, financial analysts, journalists, lawyers, radiologists and so forth.
So a lot of the assumptions that we make about the kind of occupations and tasks and jobs that are going to be threatened by automation in the future are very likely to be challenged going forward.
So as we put these trends together, I think what it shows is that we could very well end up in a future with significant unemployment.
Or at a minimum, we could face lots of underemployment or stagnant wages, maybe even declining wages.
And, of course, soaring levels of inequality.
All of that, of course, is going to put a terrific amount of stress on the fabric of society.
But beyond that, there's also a fundamental economic problem, and that arises because jobs are currently the primary mechanism that distributes income, and therefore purchasing power, to all the consumers that buy the products and services we're producing.
In order to have a vibrant market economy, you've got to have lots and lots of consumers that are really capable of buying the products and services that are being produced.
If you don't have that, then you run the risk of economic stagnation, or maybe even a declining economic spiral, as there simply aren't enough customers out there to buy the products and services being produced.
It's really important to realize that all of us as individuals rely on access to that market economy in order to be successful.
You can visualize that by thinking in terms of one really exceptional person.
Imagine for a moment you take, say, Steve Jobs, and you drop him on an island all by himself.
On that island, he's going to be running around, gathering coconuts just like anyone else.
He's really not going to be anything special, and the reason, of course, is that there is no market for him to scale his incredible talents across.
So access to this market is really critical to us as individuals, and also to the entire system in terms of it being sustainable.
So the question then becomes: What exactly could we do about this?
And I think you can view this through a very utopian framework.
You can imagine a future where we all have to work less, we have more time for leisure, more time to spend with our families, more time to do things that we find genuinely rewarding and so forth.
And I think that's a terrific vision. That's something that we should absolutely strive to move toward.
But at the same time, I think we have to be realistic, and we have to realize that we're very likely to face a significant income distribution problem.
A lot of people are likely to be left behind.
And I think that in order to solve that problem, we're ultimately going to have to find a way to decouple incomes from traditional work.
And the best, more straightforward way I know to do that is some kind of a guaranteed income or universal basic income.
Now, basic income is becoming a very important idea.
It's getting a lot of traction and attention, there are a lot of important pilot projects and experiments going on throughout the world.
My own view is that a basic income is not a panacea; it's not necessarily a plug-and-play solution, but rather, it's a place to start.
It's an idea that we can build on and refine.
For example, one thing that I have written quite a lot about is the possibility of incorporating explicit incentives into a basic income.
To illustrate that, imagine that you are a struggling high school student. Imagine that you are at risk of dropping out of school.
And yet, suppose you know that at some point in the future, no matter what, you're going to get the same basic income as everyone else.
Now, to my mind, that creates a very perverse incentive for you to simply give up and drop out of school.
So I would say, let's not structure things that way.
Instead, let's pay people who graduate from high school somewhat more than those who simply drop out.
And we can take that idea of building incentives into a basic income, and maybe extend it to other areas.
and so forth. For example, we might create an incentive to work in the community to help others, or perhaps to do positive things for the environment,
So by incorporating incentives into a basic income, we might actually improve it, and also, perhaps, take at least a couple of steps towards solving another problem that I think we're quite possibly going to face in the future, and that is, how do we all find meaning and fulfillment, and how do we occupy our time in a world where perhaps there's less demand for traditional work?
So by extending and refining a basic income, I think we can make it look better, and we can also, perhaps, make it more politically and socially acceptable and feasible -- and, of course, by doing that, we increase the odds that it will actually come to be.
I think one of the most fundamental, almost instinctive objections that many of us have to the idea of a basic income, or really to any significant expansion of the safety net, is this fear that we're going to end up with too many people riding in the economic cart, and not enough people pulling that cart.
And yet, really, the whole point I'm making here, of course, is that in the future, machines are increasingly going to be capable of pulling that cart for us.
That should give us more options for the way we structure our society and our economy, And I think eventually, it's going to go beyond simply being an option, and it's going to become an imperative.
The reason, of course, is that all of this is going to put such a degree of stress on our society, and also because jobs are that mechanism that gets purchasing power to consumers so they can then drive the economy.
If, in fact, that mechanism begins to erode in the future, then we're going to need to replace it with something else or we're going to face the risk that our whole system simply may not be sustainable.
But the bottom line here is that I really think that solving these problems, and especially finding a way to build a future economy that works for everyone, at every level of our society, is going to be one of the most important challenges that we all face in the coming years and decades.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
When you walk around the place where you live, most of the times, you feel pretty safe and comfortable, right?
Now imagine if there were land mines buried right here, scattered around, and you'd never know when you might step on one.
That's how it is for many in my home country, Colombia.
As a result of a 50-year internal armed conflict, we have an undetermined number of land mines buried throughout the countryside, affecting more than one third of the Colombian population.
These anti-personnel mines are designed to maim, not to kill their targets.
The logic behind this, which is awful, is that more resources are taken up caring for an injured soldier than dealing with a person who has been killed.
I met Adriana Rodriguez about five years ago while I was working for the Colombian government as a documentary filmmaker.
During the conflict, she was forced to leave her house ... with her kids in her arms.
One day, one of her neighbors was killed while he stepped on a land mine.
He was actually inside an abandoned house, not outside, a house exactly like the one Adriana was forced to leave.
Ever since, she has been living with the fear that she, or her children, might step on a land mine.
You know, the Colombian conflict has been running for so long that neither me nor my mom have seen our country in peace, and for someone like me, who has been living detached from all this suffering, there was only two options: either I get used to it, or I can try to change it with all my heart.
And I have to admit that for almost 30 years, I was getting used to it, you know?
But something changed for me when I met my wife.
She is a political scientist completely passionate about the Colombian armed conflict.
She helped me to understand how deeply our country has been affected by land mines and by war.
We decided to come here to the United States in search of new skills that would enable us to contribute in a fair way to our society, and maybe even help heal it.
While in grad school, I started developing an augmented reality, really broad application to help military personnel to deactivate land mines more safely.
During that time, I also realized that Colombia is not the only country in the world that has to worry about land mines.
In fact, more than 58 countries are still contaminated with any sort of explosive device.
Only in 2015, due to an escalation of war in countries like Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen, the number of [land mine casualties] almost doubled, from 3,695 to 6,461 people. Imagine that. While some countries are trying to get rid of land mines, some others are increasing their use.
But what happens when a conflict that involved land mines comes to an end?
There are two consequences.
On the one hand, the internally displaced population will start returning to their lands, and on the other hand, hidden land mines are going to start exploding more often on the civilian side.
That's the reason why I decided to join the Computer Science Department at NYU, along with Professor Claudio Silva to start to develop an app called MineSafe.
MineSafe uses information from the community to suggest paths that have been declared as the most transited without accident or incident caused by a land mine.
These traffic patterns can also be used to determine the top priority zones to be de-mined.
Almost 15 million people are living now in the countryside of Colombia.
Imagine, for a moment, if we can crowdsource information from all of them to help people like Adriana and her children to find safe and reliable paths.
This information can not only be used for that.
This information can also help them to become more productive.
Farmers will be able to find which lands have been cleared from explosive devices, and in that way, they will be able to find new, fertile grounds to start growing food again.
MineSafe has now a partnership with the Colombian government for the initial pilot, and we have now some connections with Cambodia and Somalia as well.
This project is being funded by private money here in the United States, but we don't want to stop here.
We want to go big, and we want to scale the project to every single place where land mines are still a threat.
The Colombian armed conflict is finally coming to an end, but the consequences of years of war are still buried under our feet.
We at MineSafe are working to help both people and land to find peace.
Thank you.

So last year, I ran for mayor of my hometown, Tulsa, Oklahoma.
And I was the underdog.
I was running against a two-term incumbent, and my opponent ran the classic partisan playbook.
He publicized his endorsement of Donald Trump.
He publicized a letter that he sent to President Obama protesting Syrian refugees, even though none of them were coming to Tulsa.
(Laughter)
He ran ads on TV that my kids thought made me look like Voldemort, and sent out little gems in the mail, like this. [America's most liberal labor union has endorsed]
Never mind that "America's most liberal labor union," as defined by this ad, was actually the Tulsa Firefighters Union, hardly a famed bastion of liberalism.
(Laughter)
Never mind that while she was running for president and he was serving in his final year in that office, Hillary, Barack and I could just never find the time to get together and yuck it up about the Tulsa mayor's race.
(Laughter)
Never mind that I, like my opponent, am a Republican.
(Laughter)
And so when something like this hits you in a campaign, you have to decide how you're going to respond, and we had a novel idea.
What if, instead of responding with partisanship, we responded with a focus on results?
What if we ran a campaign that was not about running against someone, but was about bringing people together behind a common vision?
And so we decided to respond not with a negative ad but with something people find even sexier -- data points.
(Laughter)
And so we emphasized things like increasing per capita income in our city, increasing our city's population, and we stuck to those relentlessly, throughout the campaign, always bringing it back to those things by which our voters could measure, in a very transparent way, how we were doing, and hold me accountable if I got elected.
And a funny thing happened when we did that.
Tulsa is home to one of the most vibrant young professional populations in the country, and they took notice of this approach.
We have in our culture in our city, an ethos where our business leaders don't just run companies, they run philanthropic institutions and nonprofits, and those folks took notice.
We have parents who are willing to sacrifice today so that their kids can have a better future, and those people took notice, too.
And so on election day, I, G.T. Bynum, a guy whose name reminds people of a circus promoter ...
(Laughter)
a guy with the raw animal magnetism of a young Orville Redenbacher ...
(Laughter)
I won the election by 17 points.
(Applause)
And we did it with the support of Republicans and Democrats.
Now, why is that story and that approach so novel?
Why do we always allow ourselves to fall back on philosophical disagreements that ultimately lead to division?
I believe it is because politicians find it easier to throw the red meat out to the base than to innovate.
The conventional wisdom is that to win an election, you have to dumb it down and play to your constituencies' basest, divisive instincts.
And when somebody wins an election like that, they win, that's true, but the rest of us lose.
And so what we need to do is think about how can we change that dynamic.
How can we move in a direction where partisanship is replaced with policy?
And fortunately, there's a growing bipartisan movement across this country that is doing just that.
One of its heroes is a guy named Mitch Daniels.
Mitch Daniels served as George W. Bush's budget director, and during that time, he created what was called the PART tool.
The PART tool allowed people to evaluate a broad range of federal programs and apply numerical scoring for them on things like program management and project results.
And using this, they evaluated over a thousand federal programs.
Over 150 programs had their funding reduced because they could not demonstrate success.
But unfortunately, there wasn't ever a well-publicized increase in funding for those programs that did demonstrate success, and because of this, the program was never really popular with Congress, and was eventually shuttered.
But the spirit of that program lived on.
Mitch Daniels went home to Indiana, ran for governor, got elected, and applied the same premise to state programs, reducing funding for those programs that could not demonstrate success, but this time, he very publicly increased funding for those programs that could demonstrate success, things like increasing the number of state troopers that they needed to have, reducing wait times at the DMV -- and today, Mitch Daniels is the president of Purdue University, applying yet again the same principles, this time at the higher ed level, and he's done that in order to keep tuition levels for students there flat for half a decade.
Now, while Mitch Daniels applied this at the federal level, the state level, and in higher ed, the guy that really cracked the code for cities is a Democrat, Martin O'Malley, during his time as Mayor of Baltimore.
Now, when Mayor O'Malley took office, he was a big fan of what they'd been able to do in New York City when it came to fighting crime.
When Rudy Giuliani first became Mayor of New York, crime statistics were collected on a monthly, even an annual basis, and then police resources would be allocated based on those statistics.
Giuliani shrunk that time frame, so that crime statistics would be collected on a daily, even hourly basis, and then police resources would be allocated to those areas quickly where crimes were occurring today rather than where they were occurring last quarter.
Well, O'Malley loved that approach, and he applied it in Baltimore.
And he applied it to the two areas that were most problematic for Baltimore from a crime-fighting standpoint.
We call these the kidneys of death. [Baltimore homicides and shootings, 1999] So there they are, the kidneys. Now watch this. Watch what happens when you apply data in real time and deploy resources quickly.
In a decade, they reduced violent crime in Baltimore by almost 50 percent, using this approach, but the genius of what O'Malley did was not that he just did what some other city was doing.
Lots of us mayors do that.
(Laughter)
He realized that the same approach could be used to all of the problems that his city faced.
And so they applied it to issue after issue in Baltimore, and today, it's being used by mayors across the country to deal with some of our greatest challenges.
And the overall approach is a very simple one -- identify the goal that you want to achieve; identify a measurement by which you can track progress toward that goal; identify a way of testing that measurement cheaply and quickly; and then deploy whatever strategies you think would work, test them, reduce funding for the strategies that don't work, and put your money into those strategies that do.
Today, Atlanta is using this to address housing issues for their homeless population.
Philadelphia has used this to reduce their crime rates to levels not enjoyed since the 1960s.
Louisville has used this not just for their city but in a community-wide effort bringing resources together to address vacant and abandoned properties.
And I am using this approach in Tulsa.
I want Tulsa to be a world-class city, and we cannot do that if we aren't clear in what our goals are and we don't use evidence and evaluation to accomplish them.
Now, what's interesting, and we've found in implementing this, a lot of people, when you talk about data, people think of that as a contrast to creativity.
What we've found is actually quite the opposite.
We've found it to be an engine for creative problem-solving, because when you're focused on a goal, and you can test different strategies quickly, the sky's the limit on the different things that you can test out.
You can come up with any strategy that you can come up with and utilize and try and test it until you find something that works, and then you double down on that.
The other area that we've found that it lends itself to creativity is that it breaks down those old silos of ownership that we run into so often in government.
It allows you to draw all the stakeholders in your community that care about homelessness or crime-fighting or education or vacant and abandoned properties, and bring those people to the table so you can work together to address your common goal.
Now, in Tulsa, we're applying this to things that are common city initiatives, things like, as you've heard now repeatedly, public safety -- that's an obvious one; improving our employee morale at the city -- we don't think you could do good things unless you've got happy employees; improving the overall street quality throughout our community.
But we're also applying it to things that are not so traditional when you think about what cities are responsible for, things like increasing per capita income, increasing our population, improving our high school graduation rates, and perhaps the greatest challenge that we face as a city.
At the dawn of the 1920s, Tulsa was home to the most vibrant African American community in the country.
The Greenwood section of our city was known as Black Wall Street.
In 1921, in one night, Tulsa experienced the worst race riot in American history.
Black Wall Street was burned to the ground, and today, a child that is born in the most predominantly African American part of our city is expected to live 11 years less than a kid that's born elsewhere in Tulsa.
Now, for us, this is a unifying issue.
Four years from now, we will recognize the 100th commemoration of that awful event, and in Tulsa, we are bringing every tool that we can to address that life-expectancy disparity, and we're not checking party registration cards at the door to the meetings.
We don't care who you voted for for president if you want to help restore the decade of life that's being stolen from these kids right now.
And so we've got white folks and black folks, Hispanic folks and Native American folks, we've got members of Congress, members of the city council, business leaders, religious leaders, Trump people and Hillary people, all joined by one common belief, and that is that a kid should have an equal shot at a good life in our city, regardless of what part of town they happen to be born in.
Now, how do we go forward with that?
Is that easy to accomplish? Of course not! If it were easy to accomplish, somebody would have already done it before us.
But what I love about city government is that the citizens can create whatever kind of city they're willing to build, and in Tulsa, we have decided to build a city where Republicans and Democrats use evidence, data and evaluation to solve our greatest challenges together.
And if we can do this, if we can set partisanship aside in the only state in the whole country where Barack Obama never carried a single county, then you can do it in your town, too.
(Laughter)
Your cities can be saved or squandered in one generation.
So let's agree to set aside our philosophical disagreements and focus on those aspirations that unite us.
Let's grasp the opportunity that is presented by innovation to build better communities for our neighbors.
Let's replace a focus on partisan division with a focus on results.
That is the path to a better future for us all.
Thank you for your time.
(Applause)
A few years ago, I always had this thing happening to me, especially at family gatherings like teas with aunts and uncles or something like this.
When people come up to you, and they ask you, "So, what are you doing?" And I would have this magical one-word reply, which would make everybody happy: "Medicine.
I'm going to be a doctor." Very easy, that's it, everybody's happy and pleased.
And it could be so easy, but this effect really only lasts for 30 seconds with me, because that's then the time when one of them would ask, "So, in what area of medicine? What specialty do you want to go into?" And then I would have to strip down in all honesty and just say, "OK, so I'm fascinated with the colon.
It all started with the anus, and now it's basically the whole intestinal tract."
(Laughter)
And this would be the moment when the enthusiasm trickled, and it would maybe also get, like, awkwardly silent in the room, and I would think this was terribly sad, because I do believe our bowels are quite charming.
(Laughter)
And while we're in a time where many people are thinking about what new superfood smoothie to make or if gluten is maybe bad for them, actually, hardly anyone seems to care about the organ where this happens, the concrete anatomy and the mechanisms behind it.
And sometimes it seems to me like we're all trying to figure out this magic trick, but nobody's checking out the magician, just because he has, like, an embarrassing hairstyle or something.
And actually, there are reasons science disliked the gut for a long time; I have to say this.
So, it's complex. There's a lot of surface area -- about 40 times the area of our skin.
Then, in such a tight pipe, there are so many immune cells that are being trained there.
We have 100 trillion bacteria doing all sorts of things -- producing little molecules.
Then there's about 20 different hormones, so we are on a very different level than our genitals, for example.
And the nervous system of our gut is so complex that when we cut out a piece, it's independent enough that when we poke it, it mumbles back at us, friendly.
(Laughter)
But at least those reasons are also the reasons why it's so fascinating and important.
It took me three steps to love the gut.
So today, I invite you to follow me on those three steps.
The very first was just looking at it and asking questions like, "How does it work?" and "Why does it have to look so weird for that sometimes?" And it actually wasn't me asking the first kind of these questions, but my roommate.
After one heavy night of partying, he came into our shared-room kitchen, and he said, "Giulia, you study medicine.
How does pooping work? "
(Laughter)
And I did study medicine but I had no idea, so I had to go up to my room and look it up in different books.
And I found something interesting, I thought, at that time.
So it turns out, we don't only have this outer sphincter, we also have an inner sphincter muscle.
The outer sphincter we all know, we can control it, we know what's going on there; the inner one, we really don't.
So what happens is, when there are leftovers from digestion, they're being delivered to the inner one first.
This inner one will open in a reflex and let through a little bit for testing.
(Laughter)
So, there are sensory cells that will analyze what has been delivered: Is it gaseous or is it solid? And they will then send this information up to our brain, and this is the moment when our brain knows, "Oh, I have to go to the toilet."
(Laughter)
The brain will then do what it's designed to do with its amazing consciousness.
It will mediate with our surroundings, and it will say something like, "So, I checked.
We are at this TEDx conference -- "
(Laughter)
Gaseous? Maybe, if you're sitting on the sides, and you know you can pull it off silently.
(Laughter)
But solid -- maybe later.
(Laughter) Since our outer sphincter and the brain is connected with nervous cells, they coordinate, cooperate, and they put it back in a waiting line --
(Laughter)
for other times, like, for example, when we're at home sitting on the couch, we have nothing better to do, we are free to go.
(Laughter)
Us humans are actually one of the very few animals that do this in such an advanced and clean way.
To be honest, I had some newfound respect for that nice, inner sphincter dude -- not connected to nerves that care too much about the outer world or the time -- just caring about me for once.
I thought that was nice.
And I used to not be a great fan of public restrooms, but now I can go anywhere, because I consider it more when that inner muscle puts a suggestion on my daily agenda.
(Laughter)
And also I learned something else, which was: looking closely at something I might have shied away from -- maybe the weirdest part of myself -- left me feeling more fearless, and also appreciating myself more.
And I think this happens a lot of times when you look at the gut, actually.
Like those funny rumbling noises that happen when you're in a group of friends or at the office conference table, going, like, "Merrr, merrr..." This is not because we're hungry.
This is because our small intestine is actually a huge neat freak, and it takes the time in between digestion to clean everything up, resulting in those eight meters of gut -- really, seven of them -- being very clean and hardly smelling like anything.
It will, to achieve this, create a strong muscular wave that moves everything forward that's been leftover after digestion.
This can sometimes create a sound, but doesn't necessarily have to always.
So what we're embarrassed of is really a sign of something keeping our insides fine and tidy.
Or this weird, crooked shape of our stomach -- a bit Quasimodo-ish.
This actually makes us be able to put pressure on our belly without vomiting, like when we're laughing and when we're doing sports, because the pressure will go up and not so much sideways.
This also creates this air bubble that's usually always very visible in X-rays, for example, and can sometimes, with some people, when it gets too big, create discomfort or even some sensations of pain.
But for most of the people, is just results that it's far easier to burp when you're laying on your left side instead of your right.
And soon I moved a bit further and started to look at the whole picture of our body and health.
This was actually after I had heard that someone I knew a little bit had killed himself.
It happened that I had been sitting next to that person the day before, and I smelled that he had very bad breath.
And when I learned of the suicide the next day, I thought: Could the gut have something to do with it? And I frantically started searching if there were scientific papers on the connection of gut and brain.
And to my surprise, I found many.
It turns out it's maybe not as simple as we sometimes think.
We tend to think our brain makes these commands and then sends them down to the other organs, and they all have to listen.
But really, it's more that 10 percent of the nerves that connect brain and gut deliver information from the brain to the gut.
We know this, for example, in stressful situations, when there are transmitters from the brain that are being sensed by our gut, so the gut will try to lower all the work, and not be working and taking away blood and energy to save energy for problem-solving.
This can go as far as nervous vomiting or nervous diarrhea to get rid of food that it then doesn't want to digest.
Maybe more interestingly, 90 percent of the nervous fibers that connect gut and brain deliver information from our gut to our brain.
And when you think about it a little bit, it does make sense, because our brain is very isolated.
It's in this bony skull surrounded by a thick skin, and it needs information to put together a feeling of "How am I, as a whole body, doing?" And the gut, actually, is possibly the most important advisor for the brain because it's our largest sensory organ, collecting information not only on the quality of our nutrients, but really also on how are so many of our immune cells doing, or things like the hormones in our blood that it can sense.
And it can package this information, and send it up to the brain.
It can, there, not reach areas like visual cortex or word formations -- otherwise, when we digest, we would see funny colors or we would make funny noises -- no.
But it can reach areas for things like morality, fear or emotional processing or areas for self-awareness.
of "How am I, as a whole body, doing?" So it does make sense that when our body and our brain are putting together this feeling that the gut has something to contribute to this process.
And it also makes sense that people who have conditions like irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease have a higher risk of having anxiety or depression.
I think this is good information to share, because many people will think, "I have this gut thing, and maybe I also have this mental health thing." And maybe -- because science is not clear on that right now -- it's really just that the brain is feeling sympathy with their gut.
This has yet to grow in evidence until it can come to practice.
But just knowing about these kinds of research that's out there at the moment helps me in my daily life.
And it makes me think differently of my moods and not externalize so much all the time.
I feel oftentimes during the day we are a brain and a screen, and we will tend to look for answers right there and maybe the work is stupid or our neighbor -- but really, moods can also come from within.
And just knowing this helped me, for example, when I sometimes wake up too early, and I start to worry and wander around with my thoughts.
Then I think, "Stop.
What did I eat yesterday?
Did I stress myself out too much?
Did I eat too late or something?" And then maybe get up and make myself a tea, something light to digest.
And as simple as that sounds, I think it's been surprisingly good for me.
Step three took me further away from our body, and to really understanding bacteria differently.
The research we have today is creating a new definition of what real cleanliness is.
And it's not the hygiene hypothesis -- I think many maybe know this.
So it states that when you have too little microbes in your environment because you clean all the time, that's not really a good thing, because people get more allergies or autoimmune diseases then.
So I knew this hypothesis, and I thought I wouldn't learn so much from looking at cleanliness in the gut.
But I was wrong.
It turns out, real cleanliness is not about killing off bacteria right away.
Real cleanliness is a bit different.
When we look at the facts, 95 percent of all bacteria on this planet don't harm us -- they can't, they don't have the genes to do so.
Many, actually, help us a lot, and scientists at the moment are looking into things like: Do some bacteria help us clean the gut? Do they help us digest? Do they make us put on weight or have a lean figure although we're eating lots?
Are others making us feel more courageous or even more resilient to stress? So you see, there are more questions when it comes to cleanliness.
And, actually, the thing is, it's about a healthy balance, I think.
You can't avoid the bad all the time.
This is simply not possible; there's always something bad around.
So what really the whole deal is when you look at a clean gut, it's about having good bacteria, enough of them, and then some bad.
Our immune system needs the bad, too, so it knows what it's looking out for.
So I started having this different perspective on cleanliness and a few weeks later, I held a talk at my university, and I made a mistake by 1,000.
And I went home and I realized in that moment, I was like, "Ah!
I made a mistake by 1,000.
Oh God, that's so much, and that's so embarrassing." And I started to think about this, I was like, "Ugh!" And after a while I said, "OK, I made this one mistake, but then I also told so many good and right and helpful things, so I think it's OK, you know?
It's a clean thing." And then I was like, "Oh, wait.
Maybe I took my perspective on cleanliness further." And it's my theory at the moment that maybe we all do.
Take it a bit further than just cleaning our living room, where maybe we make it to sort like a life hygiene.
Knowing that this is about fostering the good just as much as trying to shelter yourself from the bad had a very calming effect on me.
So in that sense, I hope today I told you mostly good and helpful things, and thank you for your time, for listening to me.
(Applause)
Fifteen years ago, I thought that the diversity stuff was not something I had to worry about.
It was something an older generation had to fight for.
In my university, we were 50-50, male-female, and we women often had better grades.
So while not everything was perfect, diversity and leadership decisions was something that would happen naturally over time, right?
Well, not quite. While moving up the ladder working as a management consultant across Europe and the US, I started to realize how often I was the only woman in the room and how homogenous leadership still is.
Many leaders I met saw diversity as something to comply with out of political correctness, or, best case, the right thing to do, but not as a business priority.
They just did not have a reason to believe that diversity would help them achieve their most immediate, pressing goals: hitting the numbers, delivering the new product, the real goals they are measured by.
My personal experience working with diverse teams had been that while they require a little bit more effort at the beginning, they did bring fresher, more creative ideas.
So I wanted to know: Are diverse organizations really more innovative, and can diversity be more than something to comply with?
Can it be a real competitive advantage?
So to find out, we set up a study with the Technical University of Munich.
We surveyed 171 companies in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and as we speak, we're expanding the study to 1,600 companies in five additional countries around the world.
We asked those companies basically two things: how innovative they are and how diverse they are.
To measure the first one, we asked them about innovation revenue.
Innovation revenue is the share of revenues they've made from new products and services in the last three years, meaning we did not ask them how many creative ideas they have, but rather if these ideas translate into products and services that really make the company more successful today and tomorrow.
To measure diversity, we looked at six different factors: country of origin, age and gender, amongst others.
While preparing to go in the field with those questions, I sat down with my team and we discussed what we would expect as a result.
To put it mildly, we were not optimistic.
The most skeptical person on the team thought, or saw a real possibility, that we would find nothing at all.
Most of the team was rather on the cautious side, so we landed all together at "only if," meaning that we might find some kind of link between innovation and diversity, but not across the board -- rather only if certain criteria are met, for example leadership style, very open leadership style that allowed people to speak up freely and safely and contribute.
A couple of months later, the data came in, and the results convinced the most skeptical amongst us.
The answer was a clear yes, no ifs, no buts.
The data in our sample showed that more diverse companies are simply more innovative, period.
Now, a fair question to ask is the chicken or the egg question, meaning, are companies really more innovative because they have a more diverse leadership, or the other way around?
Which way is it?
Now, we do not know how much is correlation versus causation, but what we do know is that clearly, in our sample, companies that are more diverse are more innovative, and that companies that are more innovative have more diverse leadership, too.
So it's fair to assume that it works both ways, diversity driving innovation and innovation driving diversity.
Now, once we published the results, we were surprised about the reactions in the media.
We got quite some attention.
And it went from quite factual, like "Higher Female Share Boosts Innovation" to a little bit more sensationalist.
(Laughter)
As you can see, "Stay-at-home Women Cost Trillions," and, my personal favorite, "Housewives Kill Innovation." Well, there's no such thing as bad publicity, right?
(Laughter)
On the back of that coverage, we started to get calls from senior executives wanting to understand more, especially -- surprise, surprise -- about gender diversity.
I tend to open up those discussions by asking, "Well, what do you think of the situation in your organization today?" And a frequent reaction to that is, "Well, we're not yet there, but we're not that bad." One executive told me, for example, "Oh, we're not that bad.
We have one member in our board who is a woman."
(Laughter)
And you laugh --
(Applause)
Now, you laugh, but he had a point in being proud about it, because in Germany, if you have a company and it has one member on the board who is a woman, you are part of a select group of 30 out of the 100 largest publicly listed companies.
The other 70 companies have an all-male board, and not even one of these hundred largest publicly listed companies have, as of today, a female CEO.
But here's the critically important insight.
Those few female board members alone, they won't make a difference.
Our data shows that for gender diversity to have an impact on innovation, you need to have more than 20 percent women in leadership.
Let's have a look at the numbers.
As you can see, we divided the sample into three groups, and the results are quite dramatic.
Only in the group where you have more than 20 percent women in leadership, only then you see a clear jump in innovation revenue to above-average levels.
So experience and data shows that you do need critical mass to move the needle, and companies like Alibaba, JP Morgan or Apple have as of today already achieved that threshold.
Another reaction I got quite a lot was, "Well, it will get solved over time." And I have all the sympathy in the world for that point of view, because I used to think like that, too.
Now, let's have a look here again and look at the numbers, taking Germany as an example.
Let me first give you the good news.
So the share of women who are college graduates and have at least 10 years of professional experience has grown nicely over the last 20 years, which means the pool in which to fish for female leaders has increased over time, and that's great.
Now, according to my old theory, the share of women in leadership would have grown more or less in parallel, right?
Now, let's have a look at what happened in reality.
It's not even close, which means I was so wrong and which means that my generation, your generation, the best-educated female generation in history, we have just not made it.
We have failed to achieve leadership in significant numbers.
Education just did not translate into leadership.
Now, that was a painful realization for me and made me realize, if we want to change this, we need to engage, and we need to do better.
Now, what to do?
Achieving more than 20 percent women in leadership seems like a daunting task to many, understandably, given the track record.
But it's doable, and there are many companies today that are making progress there and doing it successfully.
Let's take SAP, the software company, as an example.
They had, in 2011, 19 percent women in leadership, yet they decided to do better, and they did what you do in any other area of business where you want to improve.
They set themselves a measurable target.
So they set themselves a target of 25 percent for 2017, which they have just achieved.
The goals made them think more creatively about developing leaders and tapping new recruiting pools.
They now even set a target of 30 percent women in leadership for 2022.
So experience shows it's doable, and at the end of the day, it all boils down to two decisions that are taken every day in every organization by many of us: who to hire and who to develop and promote.
Now, nothing against women's programs, networks, mentoring, trainings. All is good. But it is these two decisions that at the end of the day send the most powerful change signal in any organization.
Now, I never set out to be a diversity advocate.
I am a business advisor.
But now my goal is to change the face of leadership, to make it more diverse -- and not so that leaders can check a box and feel like they have complied with something or they have been politically correct.
But because they understand, they understand that diversity is making their organization more innovative, better.
And by embracing diversity, by embracing diverse talent, we are providing true opportunity for everyone.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
(Applause)
Congratulations. By being here, listening, alive, a member of a growing species, you are one of history's greatest winners -- the culmination of a success story four billion years in the making.
You are life's one percent.
The losers, the 99 percent of species who have ever lived, are dead -- killed by fire, flood, asteroids, predation, starvation, ice, heat and the cold math of natural selection.
Your ancestors, back to the earliest fishes, overcame all these challenges.
You are here because of golden opportunities made possible by mass extinction.
(Laughter)
It's true. The same is true of your co-winners and relatives.
The 34,000 kinds of fishes.
How did we all get so lucky? Will we continue to win? I am a fish paleobiologist who uses big data -- the fossil record -- to study how some species win and others lose.
The living can't tell us; they know nothing but winning.
So, we must speak with the dead.
How do we make dead fishes talk?
Museums contain multitudes of beautiful fish fossils, but their real beauty emerges when combined with the larger number of ugly, broken fossils, and reduced to ones and zeros.
I can trawl a 500-million-year database for evolutionary patterns.
For example, fish forms can be captured by coordinates and transformed to reveal major pathways of change and trends through time.
Here is the story of the winners and losers of just one pivotal event I discovered using fossil data.
Let's travel back 360 million years -- six times as long ago as the last dinosaur -- to the Devonian period; a strange world.
Armored predators with razor-edge jaws dominated alongside huge fishes with arm bones in their fins.
Crab-like fishes scuttled across the sea floor.
The few ray-fin relatives of salmon and tuna cowered at the bottom of the food chain.
The few early sharks lived offshore in fear.
Your few four-legged ancestors, the tetrapods, struggled in tropical river plains. Ecosystems were crowded. There was no escape, no opportunity in sight.
Then the world ended.
(Laughter)
No, it is a good thing.
96 percent of all fish species died during the Hangenberg event, 359 million years ago: an interval of fire and ice.
A crowded world was disrupted and swept away.
Now, you might think that's the end of the story.
The mighty fell, the meek inherited the earth, and here we are.
But winning is not that simple.
The handful of survivors came from many groups -- all greatly outnumbered by their own dead.
They ranged from top predator to bottom-feeder, big to small, marine to freshwater.
The extinction was a filter.
It merely leveled the playing field.
What really counted was what survivors did over the next several million years in that devastated world.
The former overlords should have had an advantage.
They became even larger, storing energy, investing in their young, spreading across the globe, feasting on fishes, keeping what had always worked, and biding their time.
Yet they merely persisted for a while, declining without innovating, becoming living fossils.
They were too stuck in their ways and are now largely forgotten.
A few of the long-suffering ray-fins, sharks and four-legged tetrapods went the opposite direction. They became smaller -- living fast, dying young, eating little and reproducing rapidly.
They tried new foods, different homes, strange heads and weird bodies.
(Laughter)
And they found opportunity, proliferated, and won the future for their 60,000 living species, including you.
That's why they look familiar.
You know their names.
Winning is not about random events or an arms race.
Rather, survivors went down alternative, evolutionary pathways.
Some found incredible success, while others became dead fish walking.
(Laughter)
A real scientific term.
(Laughter)
I am now investigating how these pathways to victory and defeat repeat across time.
My lab has already compiled thousands upon thousands of dead fishes, but many more remain.
However, it is already clear that your ancestors' survival through mass extinction, and their responses in the aftermath made you who you are today.
What does this tell us for the future?
As long as a handful of species survive, life will recover.
The versatile and the lucky will not just replace what was lost, but win in new forms. It just might take several million years.
Thank you.
(Applause)
With me here today I brought something beautiful.
This is a feather from one of the most beautiful birds we have in Kenya, the crested guinea fowl.
But this feather is more than just that.
If you've taken time when you are outdoors to look at the feathers around you, you'll have noticed that there is this huge variety of different sizes, shapes and even colors.
The feather is one of the most astonishing pieces of technology invented by the natural world, and for centuries, this feather has helped birds to keep dry, to keep warm and even power flight. Only one section of the tree of life can actually make a feather.
Among all the world's animals, birds are the only ones who can make something like what I'm holding today.
I personally have given them a nickname, and I like to call them the feathermakers.
It is the major difference between birds and any other animals we have on earth, and if you can't make a feather, you cannot call yourself a bird.
(Laughter)
For us humans, who are earthbound, birds represent freedom.
This feather has enabled birds to conquer gravity and take to the air in an extraordinary way.
Don't you sometimes wish you could fly like a bird?
Birds are my passion, and I want to change the way each one of you thinks about them.
The easiest reason I love them so much is because they are beautiful.
There are 10,000 species in the world, and each one of them is uniquely beautiful.
Birds are amazing, and this talk is dedicated to all the birds of the world.
Indeed, these birds have been part of our lives and cultures all over the world for centuries, and every society has a story about birds.
You probably have heard childhood stories of different birds and how they relate with man.
I personally recently learned that our human ancestors would follow flocks of vultures and then they would help them to identify where carcasses have been dropped by large carnivores, and these humans will scavenge and eat part of that meat.
Birds have been used as brands and labels all over the world.
You know the bald eagle? It was chosen as the national emblem for the US because of its majestic strength, beautiful looks and even a long lifespan.
And just like us humans who have managed to live in virtually all habitats of this earth, birds have also conquered the world. From birds such as these beautiful penguins that live in the cold ice caps to even others like the larks, who live in the hottest deserts you can imagine.
Indeed, these species have conquered this world.
Birds also build houses like us.
The real pros in housebuilding are a group of birds we call the weaverbirds, and this name they were given because of the way in which they weave their nests.
An interesting one: birds also love and date just like us humans.
In fact, you'll be surprised to know that males dress to impress the women, and I'll show you how.
So here we have a long-tailed widowbird, and this is how they would normally look.
But when it comes to the breeding season, everything changes, and this is how he looks.
(Audience murmurs)
Yeah? Birds also, multiple species of them, do love to touch and cuddle just like humans.
And I know you're wondering about this one. Yes, they kiss too, sometimes very deeply.
(Applause)
Some have even learned to cheat on their spouses.
(Laughter)
For example, the African jacana: the females will mate with multiple males and then she takes off to find other males to mate with and she leaves the male behind to take care of the chicks.
(Laughter)
And birds help us so much, and they play very crucial roles in our ecosystems each day.
Vultures clean up our environment by literally digesting disease-causing pathogens, and they finish carcasses that would otherwise cost us lots of money to clear from the environment.
A sizable flock of vultures is capable of bringing down a carcass the size of a zebra straight to the bone within just about 30 minutes.
Owls help to rid the environments of rodents and this helps us a lot because it saves us money -- we don't lose our crops -- and secondly, we don't have to buy harmful chemicals to handle these rodents.
The beautiful sunbirds we see in our environments are part of nature's pollination crew, and they help our plants to form fruits.
Together with other pollinators like insects, they have actually helped us to get most of the food crops that we depend on for many years.
Unfortunately, the story of birds is by far not perfect.
They are faced by numerous challenges every day wherever they live.
Top on the threats facing birds is habitat loss and reduced food availability.
Birds are also hunted, especially migratory species and ducks that congregate in water bodies.
Poisoning is happening to flocks that like to stick together, especially in places like rice schemes.
Moreover, power lines are electrocuting birds and wind farms are slicing birds when they fly through the blades.
Recently, we've heard the talk of climate change making a lot of headlines, and it's also affecting birds, because birds are being forced to migrate to better breeding and feeding grounds because unfortunately where they used to live is no longer habitable.
My own perspective towards birds was changed when I was a small boy in high school, and there was this boy who struck, injuring the wing and the leg of a bird we called the augur buzzard.
I was standing there, just a mere 14-year-old, and I imagined a human being in a similar situation, because this bird could not help itself.
So even if I was hardly any biologist by then, I gathered with three of my friends and we decided to house the bird until it had regained strength and then let it free.
Interestingly, it accepted to feed on beef from our school kitchen, and we hunted termites around the compound for its dinner every day.
After a few days, it had regained strength and we released it.
We were so happy to see it flap its wings and fly off gracefully.
And that experience changed the way we looked at birds.
We went on to actually make a magazine, and we called it the Hawk Magazine, and this was in honor of this bird that we had helped within our own high school.
Those experiences in high school made me the conservationist I am today.
And a passion for birds should especially matter for Africa and all Africans, because among all other continents, Africa hosts some of the most amazing bird species you can find anywhere in the world.
Imagine having a name like "shoebill." That's the name of that bird.
And there are countries like DR Congo, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya who are leading the continent in highest numbers of diversity when it comes to the species.
These birds continue to provide the continent with very crucial ecosystem services that Africa needs.
Moreover, there is huge potential for Africa to lead the world in avian tourism.
The economy will definitely benefit.
Imagine how many communities will benefit from groups of tourists visiting their villages just to see the endemic birds that can only be found in those villages.
How can we help birds together?
There is now a chance for all of you to turn your passion for birds into contributing to their continued survival, and you can do that by becoming a citizen scientist.
Citizen science is a growing trend around the world, and we are having scenarios where people are sharing information with the rest of the community about traffic updates, security alerts and so on.
That is exactly what we realized as bird-watchers, and we thought, because birds are found everywhere, if we've got all of you and everyone else in Africa to tell us the birds they find where they live, where they school, or even where they work, then we can be able to come up with a map of every single species, and from there scientists will be able to actually prioritize conservation efforts to those habitats that matter the most.
Take for example these two projects, the Africa Raptor DataBank, which is mapping all birds of prey in the continent of Africa, and the Kenya Bird Map, which is mapping about 1,100 species that occur in my country, Kenya.
These two projects now have online databases that are allowing people to submit data, and this is converted into very interactive websites that the public can consume and make decisions from.
But when we started, there was a big challenge.
We received many complaints from bird-watchers, and they will say, "I'm in a village, and I cannot access a computer.
How do I tell you what birds live in my home, or where I school, or where I work?" So we were forced to renovate our strategy and come up with a sustainable solution.
It was easy: we immediately realized that mobile phones were becoming increasingly common in Africa and most of the regions could get access to one.
So we came up with mobile phone applications that you can use on your iPhone and on your Android phone, and we made them freely available for every bird-watching enthusiast out there.
So we came up with BirdLasser, which is used by the Kenya Bird Map, and also we have the African Raptor Observations, which is now used by the African Raptor DataBank.
This was a huge breakthrough in our work and it made us get enormous amounts of data from every birder out there in the regions.
With this, we realized that citizen science is indeed very powerful, the reason being, citizen science is adaptive.
And we were able to actually convert many bird-watchers to start sharing new information with us.
When we were starting, we didn't know that birds could be a huge gateway to approaching conservation of other forms of animals.
Interestingly, now in the Virtual Museum for Africa, we have maps for dragonflies and damselflies, butterflies and moths, reptiles, frogs, orchids, spiders, scorpions, and yes, we are even mapping mushrooms.
Who could have imagined mapping mushrooms?
So this showed us that indeed we've created a community of people who care about nature in Africa.
I hereby call upon all of you to join me in promoting the value of birds within your communities.
Please just tell your friends about birds, for we are always inclined to love and care for that which we know.
Please spend a few minutes in your free time when you are at work, at school, or maybe at home, to at least look around you and see which beautiful birds are there.
Come join us in citizen science and tell us the birds you're finding in the places where you visit.
Even simpler, you could buy your child or your sibling a pair of binoculars or a bird book and let them just appreciate how beautiful these birds are. Because maybe one day they will want to care for that one which they know and love.
The children indeed are our future.
Let us please teach them to love our feathermakers, because the love of birds can be a huge gateway to appreciating all forms of nature.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
I'm the product of a bold leadership decision.
After 1956, when Tunisia became independent, our first president, Habib Bourguiba, decided to invest 20 percent of the country's national budget in education.
Yes, 20 percent, on the high end of the spectrum even by today's standards. Some people protested. What about infrastructure? What about electricity, roads and running water?
Are these not important?
I would argue that the most important infrastructure we have are minds, educated minds.
President Bourguiba helped establish free, high-quality education for every boy and every girl.
And together with millions of other Tunisians, I'm deeply indebted to that historic decision.
And that's what brought me here today, because today, we are facing a global learning crisis.
I call it learning crisis and not education crisis, because on top of the quarter of a billion children who are out of school today, even more, 330 million children, are in school but failing to learn.
And if we do nothing, if nothing changes, by 2030, just 13 years from now, half of the world's children and youth, half of 1.6 billion children and youth, will be either out of school or failing to learn.
So two years ago, I joined the Education Commission.
It's a commission brought together by former UK Prime Minister and UN Special Envoy for Global Education Gordon Brown.
Our first task was to find out: How big is the learning crisis? What's actually the scope of the problem?
Today we know: half of the world's children by 2030 will be failing to learn.
And that's how actually we discovered that we need to change the world's focus from schooling to learning, from just counting how many bodies are in classrooms to actually how many are learning.
And the second big task was, can we do anything about this?
Can we do anything about this big, vast, silent, maybe most-neglected international crisis?
And what we found out is, we can. It's actually amazing. We can, for the first time, have every child in school and learning within just one generation.
And we don't even have to really invent the wheel to do so.
We just need to learn from the best in class, but not any best in class -- the best in your own class.
What we did is actually we looked at countries by income level: low-income, mid-income, high-income.
We looked at what the 25 percent fastest improvers in education do, and what we found out is that if every country moves at the same rate as the fastest improvers within their own income level, then within just one generation we can have every child in school and learning.
Let me give you an example.
Let's take Tunisia for example.
We're not telling Tunisia, "You should move as fast as Finland." No disrespect, Finland.
We're telling Tunisia, "Look at Vietnam." They spend similar amounts for primary and secondary pupils as percentage of GDP per capita, but achieves today higher results.
Vietnam introduced a standardized assessment for literacy and numeracy, teachers in Vietnam are better monitored than in other developing countries, and students' achievements are made public.
And it shows in the results.
In the 2015 PISA -- Program for International Student Assessment -- Vietnam outperformed many wealthy economies, including the United States.
Now, if you're not an education expert, you may ask, "What's new and different?
Don't all countries track student progress and make those achievements public? "No.
The sad answer is no.
We are very far from it.
Only half of the developing countries have systematic learning assessment at primary school, and even less so at lower secondary school.
So if we don't know if children are learning, how are teachers supposed to focus their attention on delivering results, and how are countries supposed to prioritize education spending actually to delivering results, if they don't know if children are learning?
That's why the first big transformation before investing is to make the education system deliver results.
Because pouring more money into broken systems may only fund more inefficiencies.
And what deeply worries me -- if children go to school and don't learn, it devalues education, and it devalues spending on education, so that governments and political parties can say, "Oh, we are spending so much money on education, but children are not learning.
They don't have the right skills.
Maybe we should spend less."
Now, improving current education systems to deliver results is important, but won't be enough.
What about countries where we won't have enough qualified teachers? Take Somalia, for example. If every student in Somalia became a teacher -- every person who finishes tertiary education became a teacher -- we won't have enough teachers.
And what about children in refugee camps, or in very remote rural areas?
Take Filipe, for example. Filipe lives in one of the thousands of communities alongside the Amazonas rivers.
His village of 78 people has 20 families.
Filipe and a fellow student were the only two attending grade 11 in 2015.
Now, the Amazonas is a state in the northwest of Brazil.
It's four and a half times the size of Germany, and it's fully covered in jungle and rivers.
A decade ago, Filipe and his fellow student would have had just two alternatives: moving to Manaus, the capital, or stopping studying altogether, which most of them did.
In 2009, however, Brazil passed a new law that made secondary education a guarantee for every Brazilian and an obligation for every state to implement this by 2016.
But giving access to high-quality education, you know, in the Amazonas state, is huge and expensive.
How are you going to get, you know, math and science and history teachers all over those communities?
And even if you find them, many of them would not want to move there.
So faced with this impossible task, civil servants and state officials developed amazing creativity and entrepreneurship.
They developed the media center solution. It works this way. You have specialized, trained content teachers in Manaus delivering classroom via livestream to over a thousand classrooms in those scattered communities.
Those classrooms have five to 25 students, and they're supported by a more generalist tutoring teacher for their learning and development.
The 60 content teachers in Manaus work with over 2,200 tutoring teachers in those communities to customize lesson plans to the context and time.
Now, why is this division between content teacher and tutoring teacher important?
First of all, as I told you, because in many countries, we just don't have enough qualified teachers.
But secondly also because teachers do too many things they're either not trained for or not supposed to do.
Let's look at Chile, for example.
In Chile, for every doctor, you have four and a half people, four and a half staff supporting them, and Chile is on the low end of the spectrum here, because in developing countries, on average, every doctor has 10 people supporting them.
A teacher in Chile, however, has less than half a person, 0.3 persons, supporting them.
Imagine a hospital ward with 20, 40, 70 patients and you have a doctor doing it all by themselves: no nurses, no medical assistants, no one else.
You will say this is absurd and impossible, but this is what teachers are doing all over the world every day with classrooms of 20, 40, or 70 students.
So this division between content and tutoring teachers is amazing because it is changing the paradigm of the teacher, so that each does what they can do best and so that children are not just in school but in school and learning.
And some of these content teachers, they became celebrity teachers.
You know, some of them run for office, and they helped raise the status of the profession so that more students wanted to become teachers.
And what I love about this example is beyond changing the paradigm of the teacher.
It teaches us how we can harness technology for learning.
The live-streaming is bidirectional, so students like Filipe and others can present information back.
And we know technology is not always perfect.
You know, state officials expect between five to 15 percent of the classrooms every day to be off live-stream because of flood, broken antennas or internet not working.
And yet, Filipe is one of over 300,000 students that benefited from the media center solution and got access to postprimary education.
This is a living example how technology is not just an add-on but can be central to learning and can help us bring school to children if we cannot bring children to school.
Now, I hear you. You're going to say, "How are we going to implement this all over the world?" I've been in government myself and have seen how difficult it is even to implement the best ideas.
So as a commission, we started two initiatives to make the "Learning Generation" a reality.
The first one is called the Pioneer Country Initiative.
Over 20 countries from Africa and Asia have committed to make education their priority and to transform their education systems to deliver results.
We've trained country leaders in a methodology called the delivery approach.
What this does is basically two things.
In the planning phase, we take everyone into a room -- teachers, teacher unions, parent associations, government officials, NGOs, everyone -- so that the reform and the solution we come up with are shared by everyone and supported by everyone.
And in the second phase, it does something special.
It's kind of a ruthless focus on follow-up.
So week by week you check, has that been done, what was supposed to be done, and even sometimes sending a person physically to the district or school to check that versus just hoping that it happened.
It may sound for many common sense, but it's not common practice, and that's why actually many reforms fail.
It has been piloted in Tanzania, and there the pass rate for students in secondary education was increased by 50 percent in just over two years.
Now, the next initiative to make the Learning Generation a reality is financing. Who's going to pay for this?
So we believe and argue that domestic financing has to be the backbone of education investment.
Do you remember when I told you about Vietnam earlier outperforming the United States in PISA?
That's due to a better education system, but also to Vietnam increasing their investment from seven to 20 percent of their national budget in two decades.
But what happens if countries want to borrow money for education?
If you wanted to borrow money to build a bridge or a road, it's quite easy and straightforward, but not for education.
It's easier to make a shiny picture of a bridge and show it to everyone than one of an educated mind.
That's kind of a longer term commitment.
So we came up with a solution to help countries escape the middle income trap, countries that are not poor enough or not poor, thankfully, anymore, that cannot profit from grants or interest-free loans, and they're not rich enough to be able to have attractive interests on their loans.
So we're pooling donor money in a finance facility for education, which will provide more finance for education.
We will subsidize, or even eliminate completely, interest payments on the loans so that countries that commit to reforms can borrow money, reform their education system, and pay this money over time while benefiting from a better-educated population.
This solution has been recognized in the last G20 meeting in Germany, and so finally today education is on the international agenda.
But let me bring this back to the personal level, because this is where the impact lands.
Without that decision to invest a young country's budget, 20 percent of a young country's budget in education, I would have never been able to go to school, let alone in 2014 becoming a minister in the government that successfully ended the transition phase.
Tunisia's Nobel Peace Prize in 2015 as the only democracy that emerged from the Arab Spring is a legacy to that bold leadership decision.
Education is the civil rights struggle, it's the human rights struggle of our generation.
Quality education for all: that's the freedom fight that we've got to win.
Thank you.
(Applause)
As you've probably noticed, in recent years, a lot of western forests have burned in large and destructive wildfires.
If you're like me -- this western landscape is actually why my family and I live here.
And as a scientist and a father, I've become deeply concerned about what we're leaving behind for our kids, and now my five grandkids.
In the US, an area that's larger than the state of Oregon has burned in just the last 10 years, and tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed.
Acres burned and homes destroyed have steadily increased over the last three decades, and individual fires that are bigger than 100,000 acres -- they're actually on the rise.
These are what we call "megafires." Megafires are the result of the way we've managed this western landscape over the last 150 years in a steadily warming climate.
Much of the destruction that we are currently seeing could actually have been avoided.
I've spent my entire career studying these western landscapes, and the science is pretty clear: if we don't change a few of our fire-management habits, we're going to lose many more of our beloved forests.
Some won't recover in our lifetime or my kids' lifetime.
It's time we confront some tough truths about wildfires, and come to understand that we need to learn to better live with them and change how they come to our forests, our homes and our communities.
So why is this happening?
Well, that's what I want to talk to you about today.
You see this forest?
Isn't it beautiful?
Well, the forests that we see today look nothing like the forests of 100 or 150 years ago.
Thankfully, panoramic photos were taken in the 1930s from thousands of western mountaintop lookouts, and they show a fair approximation of the forest that we inherited.
The best word to describe these forests of old is "patchy." The historical forest landscape was this constantly evolving patchwork of open and closed canopy forests of all ages, and there was so much evidence of fire.
And most fires were pretty small by today's standards.
And it's important to understand that this landscape was open, with meadows and open canopy forests, and it was the grasses of the meadows and in the grassy understories of the open forest that many of the wildfires were carried.
There were other forces at work, too, shaping this historical patchwork: for example, topography, whether a place faces north or south or it's on a ridge top or in a valley bottom; elevation, how far up the mountain it is; and weather, whether a place gets a lot of snow and rain, sunlight and warmth.
These things all worked together to shape the way the forest grew.
And the way the forest grew shaped the way fire behaved on the landscape.
There was crosstalk between the patterns and the processes.
You can see the new dry forest.
Trees were open grown and fairly far apart.
Fires were frequent here, and when they occurred, they weren't that severe, while further up the mountain, in the moist and the cold forests, trees were more densely grown and fires were less frequent, but when they occurred, they were quite a bit more severe.
These different forest types, the environments that they grew in and fire severity -- they all worked together to shape this historical patchwork.
And there was so much power in this patchwork.
It provided a natural mechanism to resist the spread of future fires across the landscape.
Once a patch of forest burned, it helped to prevent the flow of fire across the landscape.
A way to think about it is, the burned patches helped the rest of the forest to be forest.
Let's add humans to the mix.
For 10,000 years, Native Americans lived on this landscape, and they intentionally burned it -- a lot.
They used fire to burn meadows and to thin certain forests so they could grow more food.
They used fire to increase graze for the deer and the elk and the bison that they hunted.
And most importantly, they figured out if they burned in the spring and the fall, they could avoid the out-of-control fires of summer.
European settlement -- it occurred much later, in the mid-1800s, and by the 1880s, livestock grazing was in high gear.
I mean, if you think about it, the cattle and the sheep ate the grasses which had been the conveyer belt for the historical fires, and this prevented once-frequent fires from thinning out trees and burning up dead wood.
Later came roads and railroads, and they acted as potent firebreaks, interrupting further the flow of fire across this landscape.
And then something happened which caused a sudden pivot in our society.
In 1910, we had a huge wildfire.
It was the size of the state of Connecticut.
We called it "the Big Burn." It stretched from eastern Washington to western Montana, and it burned, in a few days, three million acres, devoured several towns, and it killed 87 people.
Most of them were firefighters.
in our society. Because of the Big Burn, wildfire became public enemy number one, and this would shape the way that we would think about wildfire for the next hundred years.
Thereafter, the Forest Service, just five years young at the time, was tasked with the responsibility of putting out all wildfires on 193 million acres of public lands, and they took this responsibility very seriously.
They developed this unequaled ability to put fires out, and they put out 95 to 98 percent of all fires every single year in the US.
And from this point on, it was now fire suppression and not wildfires that would become a prime shaper of our forests.
After World War II, timber harvesting got going in the west, and the logging removed the large and the old trees.
These were survivors of centuries of wildfires.
And the forest filled in.
Thin-barked, fire-sensitive small trees filled in the gaps, and our forests became dense, with trees so layered and close together that they were touching each other.
So fires were unintentionally blocked by roads and railroads, the cattle and sheep ate the grass, then along comes fire suppression and logging, removing the big trees, and you know what happened?
All these factors worked together to allow the forest to fill in, creating what I call the current epidemic of trees.
(Laughter)
Go figure.
(Laughter)
More trees than the landscape can support.
So when you compare what forests looked like 100 years ago and today, the change is actually remarkable.
Notice how the patchwork has filled in.
Dry south slopes -- they're now covered with trees.
A patchwork that was once sculptured by mostly small and sort of medium-sized fires has filled in.
Do you see the blanket of trees?
After just 150 years, we have a dense carpet of forest.
But there's more. Because trees are growing so close together, and because tree species, tree sizes and ages are so similar across large areas, fires not only move easily from acre to acre, but now, so do diseases and insect outbreaks, which are killing or reducing the vitality of really large sections of forest now.
And after a century without fire, dead branches and downed trees on the forest floor, they're at powder-keg levels.
What's more, our summers are getting hotter and they're getting drier and they're getting windier.
And the fire season is now 40 to 80 days longer each year.
Because of this, climatologists are predicting that the area burned since 2000 will double or triple in the next three decades.
And we're building houses in the middle of this.
Two recently published studies tell us that more than 60 percent of all new housing starts are being built in this flammable and dangerous mess.
So when we do get a fire, large areas can literally go up in smoke.
How do you feel now about the forest image that I first showed you? It scares the heck out of me.
So what do we do? We need to restore the power of the patchwork.
We need to put the right kind of fire back into the system again.
It's how we can resize the severity of many of our future fires.
And the silver lining is that we have tools and we have know-how to do this.
Let's look at some of the tools.
We can use prescribed burning to intentionally thin out trees and burn up dead fuels. We do this to systematically reduce them and keep them reduced.
And what is that going to do?
It's going to create already-burned patches on the landscape that will resist the flow of future fires.
We can combine mechanical thinning with some of these treatments where it's appropriate to do so, and capture some commercial value and perhaps underwrite some of these treatments, especially around urban areas.
And the best news of all is that prescribed burning produces so much less smoke than wildfires do.
It's not even close.
But there's a hitch: prescribed burning smoke is currently regulated under air quality rules as an avoidable nuisance. But wildfire smoke? It simply gets a pass.
Makes sense, doesn't it? (Laughs) So you know what happens?
We do far too little prescribed burning, and we continually eat smoke in the summers from megafires.
We all need to work together to get this changed.
And finally, there's managed wildfires.
Instead of putting all the fires out, we need to put some of them back to work thinning forests and reducing dead fuels.
We can herd them around the landscape when it's appropriate to do so to help restore the power of the patchwork.
And as you've probably figured out by now, this is actually a social problem.
It's got ecological and climate explanations, but it's a social problem, and it will take us humans to solve it.
Public support for these tools is poor.
Prescribed burning and managed wildfires are not well-supported.
We actually all simply want fires to magically go away and take that pesky smoke with them, don't we?
But there is no future without lots of fire and lots of smoke.
That option is actually not on the table.
Until we, the owners of public lands, make it our high priority to do something about the current situation, we're going to experience continued losses to megafires.
So it's up to us. We can spread this message to our lawmakers, folks who can help us manage our fires and our forests.
If we're unsuccessful, where will you go to play when your favorite places are burned black?
Where will you go to breathe deep and slow?
Thank you.
(Applause)
So when people voice fears of artificial intelligence, very often, they invoke images of humanoid robots run amok. You know? Terminator? You know, that might be something to consider, but that's a distant threat.
Or, we fret about digital surveillance with metaphors from the past. "1984," George Orwell's "1984," it's hitting the bestseller lists again.
It's a great book, but it's not the correct dystopia for the 21st century.
What we need to fear most is not what artificial intelligence will do to us on its own, but how the people in power will use artificial intelligence to control us and to manipulate us in novel, sometimes hidden, subtle and unexpected ways.
Much of the technology that threatens our freedom and our dignity in the near-term future is being developed by companies in the business of capturing and selling our data and our attention to advertisers and others: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent.
Now, artificial intelligence has started bolstering their business as well.
And it may seem like artificial intelligence is just the next thing after online ads. It's not. It's a jump in category.
It's a whole different world, and it has great potential.
It could accelerate our understanding of many areas of study and research.
But to paraphrase a famous Hollywood philosopher, "With prodigious potential comes prodigious risk."
Now let's look at a basic fact of our digital lives, online ads. Right? We kind of dismiss them. They seem crude, ineffective.
We've all had the experience of being followed on the web by an ad based on something we searched or read.
You know, you look up a pair of boots and for a week, those boots are following you around everywhere you go.
Even after you succumb and buy them, they're still following you around.
We're kind of inured to that kind of basic, cheap manipulation.
We roll our eyes and we think, "You know what? These things don't work." Except, online, the digital technologies are not just ads.
Now, to understand that, let's think of a physical world example.
You know how, at the checkout counters at supermarkets, near the cashier, there's candy and gum at the eye level of kids?
That's designed to make them whine at their parents just as the parents are about to sort of check out.
Now, that's a persuasion architecture.
It's not nice, but it kind of works.
That's why you see it in every supermarket.
Now, in the physical world, such persuasion architectures are kind of limited, because you can only put so many things by the cashier. Right? And the candy and gum, it's the same for everyone, even though it mostly works only for people who have whiny little humans beside them.
In the physical world, we live with those limitations.
In the digital world, though, persuasion architectures can be built at the scale of billions and they can target, infer, understand and be deployed at individuals one by one by figuring out your weaknesses, and they can be sent to everyone's phone private screen, so it's not visible to us. And that's different. And that's just one of the basic things that artificial intelligence can do.
Now, let's take an example.
Let's say you want to sell plane tickets to Vegas. Right? So in the old world, you could think of some demographics to target based on experience and what you can guess.
You might try to advertise to, oh, men between the ages of 25 and 35, or people who have a high limit on their credit card, or retired couples. Right? That's what you would do in the past.
With big data and machine learning, that's not how it works anymore.
So to imagine that, think of all the data that Facebook has on you: every status update you ever typed, every Messenger conversation, every place you logged in from, all your photographs that you uploaded there.
If you start typing something and change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those and analyzes them, too.
Increasingly, it tries to match you with your offline data.
It also purchases a lot of data from data brokers.
It could be everything from your financial records to a good chunk of your browsing history. Right? In the US, such data is routinely collected, collated and sold.
In Europe, they have tougher rules.
So what happens then is, by churning through all that data, these machine-learning algorithms -- that's why they're called learning algorithms -- they learn to understand the characteristics of people who purchased tickets to Vegas before.
When they learn this from existing data, they also learn how to apply this to new people.
So if they're presented with a new person, they can classify whether that person is likely to buy a ticket to Vegas or not. Fine. You're thinking, an offer to buy tickets to Vegas. I can ignore that.
But the problem isn't that.
The problem is, we no longer really understand how these complex algorithms work.
We don't understand how they're doing this categorization.
It's giant matrices, thousands of rows and columns, maybe millions of rows and columns, and not the programmers and not anybody who looks at it, even if you have all the data, understands anymore how exactly it's operating any more than you'd know what I was thinking right now if you were shown a cross section of my brain.
It's like we're not programming anymore, we're growing intelligence that we don't truly understand.
And these things only work if there's an enormous amount of data, so they also encourage deep surveillance on all of us so that the machine learning algorithms can work.
That's why Facebook wants to collect all the data it can about you.
The algorithms work better.
So let's push that Vegas example a bit.
What if the system that we do not understand was picking up that it's easier to sell Vegas tickets to people who are bipolar and about to enter the manic phase.
Such people tend to become overspenders, compulsive gamblers.
They could do this, and you'd have no clue that's what they were picking up on.
I gave this example to a bunch of computer scientists once and afterwards, one of them came up to me.
He was troubled and he said, "That's why I couldn't publish it." I was like, "Couldn't publish what?" He had tried to see whether you can indeed figure out the onset of mania from social media posts before clinical symptoms, and it had worked, and it had worked very well, and he had no idea how it worked or what it was picking up on.
Now, the problem isn't solved if he doesn't publish it, because there are already companies that are developing this kind of technology, and a lot of the stuff is just off the shelf.
This is not very difficult anymore.
Do you ever go on YouTube meaning to watch one video and an hour later you've watched 27?
You know how YouTube has this column on the right that says, "Up next" and it autoplays something?
It's an algorithm picking what it thinks that you might be interested in and maybe not find on your own.
It's not a human editor. It's what algorithms do.
It picks up on what you have watched and what people like you have watched, and infers that that must be what you're interested in, what you want more of, and just shows you more.
It sounds like a benign and useful feature, except when it isn't.
So in 2016, I attended rallies of then-candidate Donald Trump to study as a scholar the movement supporting him.
I study social movements, so I was studying it, too.
And then I wanted to write something about one of his rallies, so I watched it a few times on YouTube.
YouTube started recommending to me and autoplaying to me white supremacist videos in increasing order of extremism.
If I watched one, it served up one even more extreme and autoplayed that one, too.
If you watch Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders content, YouTube recommends and autoplays conspiracy left, and it goes downhill from there.
Well, you might be thinking, this is politics, but it's not.
This isn't about politics.
This is just the algorithm figuring out human behavior.
I once watched a video about vegetarianism on YouTube and YouTube recommended and autoplayed a video about being vegan.
It's like you're never hardcore enough for YouTube.
(Laughter)
So what's going on? Now, YouTube's algorithm is proprietary, but here's what I think is going on.
The algorithm has figured out that if you can entice people into thinking that you can show them something more hardcore, they're more likely to stay on the site watching video after video going down that rabbit hole while Google serves them ads.
Now, with nobody minding the ethics of the store, these sites can profile people who are Jew haters, who think that Jews are parasites and who have such explicit anti-Semitic content, and let you target them with ads.
They can also mobilize algorithms to find for you look-alike audiences, people who do not have such explicit anti-Semitic content on their profile but who the algorithm detects may be susceptible to such messages, and lets you target them with ads, too.
Now, this may sound like an implausible example, but this is real.
ProPublica investigated this and found that you can indeed do this on Facebook, and Facebook helpfully offered up suggestions on how to broaden that audience.
BuzzFeed tried it for Google, and very quickly they found, yep, you can do it on Google, too.
And it wasn't even expensive.
The ProPublica reporter spent about 30 dollars to target this category.
So last year, Donald Trump's social media manager disclosed that they were using Facebook dark posts to demobilize people, not to persuade them, but to convince them not to vote at all.
And to do that, they targeted specifically, for example, African-American men in key cities like Philadelphia, and I'm going to read exactly what he said. I'm quoting.
They were using "nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that only the people we want to see it see it. We modeled this. It will dramatically affect her ability to turn these people out."
What's in those dark posts?
We have no idea. Facebook won't tell us.
So Facebook also algorithmically arranges the posts that your friends put on Facebook, or the pages you follow.
It doesn't show you everything chronologically.
It puts the order in the way that the algorithm thinks will entice you to stay on the site longer.
Now, so this has a lot of consequences.
You may be thinking somebody is snubbing you on Facebook.
The algorithm may never be showing your post to them.
The algorithm is prioritizing some of them and burying the others.
Experiments show that what the algorithm picks to show you can affect your emotions.
But that's not all.
It also affects political behavior.
So in 2010, in the midterm elections, Facebook did an experiment on 61 million people in the US that was disclosed after the fact.
So some people were shown, "Today is election day," the simpler one, and some people were shown the one with that tiny tweak with those little thumbnails of your friends who clicked on "I voted." This simple tweak. OK? So the pictures were the only change, and that post shown just once turned out an additional 340,000 voters in that election, according to this research as confirmed by the voter rolls. A fluke? No. Because in 2012, they repeated the same experiment.
And that time, that civic message shown just once turned out an additional 270,000 voters.
For reference, the 2016 US presidential election was decided by about 100,000 votes.
Now, Facebook can also very easily infer what your politics are, even if you've never disclosed them on the site. Right? These algorithms can do that quite easily.
What if a platform with that kind of power decides to turn out supporters of one candidate over the other? How would we even know about it?
Now, we started from someplace seemingly innocuous -- online adds following us around -- and we've landed someplace else.
As a public and as citizens, we no longer know if we're seeing the same information or what anybody else is seeing, and without a common basis of information, little by little, public debate is becoming impossible, and we're just at the beginning stages of this.
These algorithms can quite easily infer things like your people's ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age and genders, just from Facebook likes.
These algorithms can identify protesters even if their faces are partially concealed.
These algorithms may be able to detect people's sexual orientation just from their dating profile pictures.
Now, these are probabilistic guesses, so they're not going to be 100 percent right, but I don't see the powerful resisting the temptation to use these technologies just because there are some false positives, which will of course create a whole other layer of problems.
Imagine what a state can do with the immense amount of data it has on its citizens.
China is already using face detection technology to identify and arrest people.
And here's the tragedy: we're building this infrastructure of surveillance authoritarianism merely to get people to click on ads.
And this won't be Orwell's authoritarianism.
This isn't "1984." Now, if authoritarianism is using overt fear to terrorize us, we'll all be scared, but we'll know it, we'll hate it and we'll resist it.
But if the people in power are using these algorithms to quietly watch us, to judge us and to nudge us, to predict and identify the troublemakers and the rebels, to deploy persuasion architectures at scale and to manipulate individuals one by one using their personal, individual weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and if they're doing it at scale through our private screens so that we don't even know what our fellow citizens and neighbors are seeing, that authoritarianism will envelop us like a spider's web and we may not even know we're in it.
So Facebook's market capitalization is approaching half a trillion dollars.
It's because it works great as a persuasion architecture.
But the structure of that architecture is the same whether you're selling shoes or whether you're selling politics.
The algorithms do not know the difference.
The same algorithms set loose upon us to make us more pliable for ads are also organizing our political, personal and social information flows, and that's what's got to change.
Now, don't get me wrong, we use digital platforms because they provide us with great value.
I use Facebook to keep in touch with friends and family around the world.
I've written about how crucial social media is for social movements.
I have studied how these technologies can be used to circumvent censorship around the world.
But it's not that the people who run, you know, Facebook or Google are maliciously and deliberately trying to make the country or the world more polarized and encourage extremism.
I read the many well-intentioned statements that these people put out.
But it's not the intent or the statements people in technology make that matter, it's the structures and business models they're building.
And that's the core of the problem.
Either Facebook is a giant con of half a trillion dollars and ads don't work on the site, it doesn't work as a persuasion architecture, or its power of influence is of great concern.
It's either one or the other.
It's similar for Google, too.
So what can we do? This needs to change. Now, I can't offer a simple recipe, because we need to restructure the whole way our digital technology operates.
Everything from the way technology is developed to the way the incentives, economic and otherwise, are built into the system.
We have to face and try to deal with the lack of transparency created by the proprietary algorithms, the structural challenge of machine learning's opacity, all this indiscriminate data that's being collected about us.
We have a big task in front of us.
We have to mobilize our technology, our creativity and yes, our politics so that we can build artificial intelligence that supports us in our human goals but that is also constrained by our human values.
And I understand this won't be easy.
We might not even easily agree on what those terms mean.
But if we take seriously how these systems that we depend on for so much operate, I don't see how we can postpone this conversation anymore.
These structures are organizing how we function and they're controlling what we can and we cannot do.
And many of these ad-financed platforms, they boast that they're free.
In this context, it means that we are the product that's being sold.
We need a digital economy where our data and our attention is not for sale to the highest-bidding authoritarian or demagogue.
(Applause)
So to go back to that Hollywood paraphrase, we do want the prodigious potential of artificial intelligence and digital technology to blossom, but for that, we must face this prodigious menace, open-eyed and now.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What if an African girl from a traditional family in a part of future Africa is accepted into the finest university in the galaxy, planets away?
What if she decides to go?
This is an excerpt from my "Binti" novella trilogy:
I powered up the transporter and said a silent prayer.
I had no idea what I was going to do if it didn't work.
My transporter was cheap, so even a droplet of moisture or, more likely, a grain of sand, would cause it to short.
It was faulty, and most of the time I had to restart it over and over before it worked. "Please not now, please not now," I thought.
The transporter shivered in the sand and I held my breath.
Tiny, flat and black as a prayer stone, it buzzed softly and then slowly rose from the sand.
Finally, it produced the baggage-lifting force. I grinned. Now I could make it to the shuttle on time.
I swiped otjize from my forehead with my index finger and knelt down, then I touched the finger to the sand, grounding the sweet-smelling red clay into it.
"Thank you," I whispered.
It was a half-mile walk along the dark desert road.
With the transporter working I would make it there on time.
Straightening up, I paused and shut my eyes.
Now, the weight of my entire life was pressing on my shoulders.
I was defying the most traditional part of myself for the first time in my entire life.
I was leaving in the dead of night, and they had no clue.
My nine siblings, all older than me except for my younger sister and brother, would never see this coming.
My parents would never imagine I'd do such a thing in a million years.
By the time they all realized what I'd done and where I was going, I'd have left the planet.
In my absence, my parents would growl to each other that I was never to set foot in their home again.
My four aunties and two uncles who lived down the road would shout and gossip amongst themselves about how I had scandalized the entire bloodline.
I was going to be a pariah.
"Go," I softly whispered to the transporter, stamping my foot.
The thin metal rings I wore around each ankle jingled noisily, but I stamped my foot again.
Once on, the transporter worked best when I didn't touch it.
"Go," I said again, sweat forming on my brow.
When nothing moved, I chanced giving the two large suitcases sitting atop the force field a shove.
They moved smoothly, and I breathed another sigh of relief.
At least some luck was on my side.
So, in a distant future part of Africa, Binti is a mathematical genius of the Himba ethnic group.
She's been accepted into a university on another planet, and she's decided to go.
Carrying the blood of her people in her veins, adorned with the teachings, ways, even the land on her very skin, Binti leaves the earth.
As the story progresses, she becomes not other, but more.
This idea of leaving but bringing and then becoming more is at one of the hearts of Afrofuturism, or you can simply call it a different type of science fiction.
I can best explain the difference between classic science fiction and Afrofuturism if I used the octopus analogy.
Like humans, octopuses are some of the most intelligent creatures on earth.
However, octopus intelligence evolved from a different evolutionary line, separate from that of human beings, so the foundation is different.
The same can be said about the foundations of various forms of science fiction.
So much of science fiction speculates about technologies, societies, social issues, what's beyond our planet, what's within our planet.
Science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of political writing.
It's all about the question, "What if?" Still, not all science fiction has the same ancestral bloodline, that line being Western-rooted science fiction, which is mostly white and male.
We're talking Isaac Asimov, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Robert Heinlein, etc.
So what if a Nigerian-American wrote science fiction?
Growing up, I didn't read much science fiction.
I couldn't relate to these stories preoccupied with xenophobia, colonization and seeing aliens as others.
And I saw no reflection of anyone who looked like me in those narratives.
In the "Binti" novella trilogy, Binti leaves the planet to seek education from extraterrestrials.
She goes out as she is, looking the way she looks, carrying her cultures, being who she is.
I was inspired to write this story not because I was following a line of classic space opera narratives, but because of blood that runs deep, family, cultural conflict and the need to see an African girl leave the planet on her own terms.
My science fiction had different ancestors, African ones.
So I'm Nigerian-American. I was born to two Nigerian immigrant parents and raised in the United States, one of the birthplaces of classic science fiction.
However, it was my Nigerian heritage that led me to write science fiction.
Specifically I cite those family trips to Nigeria in the late '90s.
I'd been taking trips back to Nigeria with my family since I was very young.
These early trips inspired me.
Hence the first story that I ever even wrote took place in Nigeria.
I wrote mainly magical realism and fantasy inspired by my love of Igbo and other West African traditional cosmologies and spiritualities.
However, in the late '90s, I started noticing the role of technology in Nigeria: cable TV and cell phones in the village, 419 scammers occupying the cybercafes, the small generator connected to my cousin's desktop computer because the power was always going on and off.
And my Americanness othered me enough to be intrigued by these things that most Nigerians saw as normal.
My intrigue eventually gave birth to stories.
I started opening strange doors.
What if aliens came to Lagos, Nigeria?
This is an excerpt from my novel, "Lagoon."
Everybody saw it, all over the world.
That was a real introduction to the great mess happening in Lagos, Nigeria, West Africa, Africa, here.
Because so many people in Lagos had portable, chargeable, glowing, vibrating, chirping, tweeting, communicating, connected devices, practically everything was recorded and posted online in some way, somehow, quickly.
The modern human world is connected like a spider's web.
The world was watching. It watched in fascinated horror for information, but mostly for entertainment.
Footage of what was happening dominated every international news source, video-sharing website, social network, circle, pyramid and trapezoid.
But the story goes deeper.
It is in the mud, the dirt, the earth, in the fond memory of the soily cosmos.
It is in the always mingling past, present and future.
It is in the water.
It is in the powerful spirits and ancestors who dwelled in Lagos.
It is in the hearts and minds of the people of Lagos. Change begets change. The alien Ayodele knew it.
All her people know it.
So, this is a voice of Udide, the supreme spider artist, who is older than dirt and lives in the dirt beneath the city of Lagos, listening and commenting and weaving the story of extraterrestrials coming to Lagos.
In the end, the great spider who was the size of a house and responsible for weaving the past, present and future decides to come forth and be a part of the story.
Like Udide, the spider artist, African science fiction's blood runs deep and it's old, and it's ready to come forth, and when it does, imagine the new technologies, ideas and sociopolitical changes it'll inspire.
For Africans, homegrown science fiction can be a will to power.
What if? It's a powerful question.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Have you ever heard of typosquatting? Well, typosquatting is where companies like Google post advertisements on websites that are commonly miskeyed, and then they sit back and rake in millions banking on the fact that you're visiting something like gmale.com or mikerowesoft.com.
(Laughter)
It just seems kind of silly, doesn't it?
How about this? On February 28, an engineer at Amazon made a similar, seemingly small key error.
Only I say seemingly small because this one little typo on Amazon's supercode produced a massive internet slowdown that cost the company over 160 million dollars in the span of just four hours.
But this is actually really scary.
You see, recently, an employee at the New England Compound, which is a pharmaceutical manufacturer, didn't clean a lab properly and now 76 people have died and 700 more have contracted meningitis.
I mean, these examples are crazy, right?
When did we come to live in a world where these types of typos, common errors, this do-your-best attitude or just good enough was acceptable?
At some point, we've stopped valuing perfection, and now, these are the type of results that we get.
You see, I think that we should all seek perfection, all the time, and I think we need to get to it quick.
You see, I run a training facility where I'm responsible for the education of professional delivery drivers, and in my line of work, we have a unique understanding of the cost of failure, the cost of just 99 percent, because in the world of professional driving, just 99 percent of the job means somebody dies.
Look, a hundred people die every day due to vehicular crashes. Think about that for a second. That's like the equivalent of four commercial airliners crashing every week, yet we still can't convince ourselves to pay perfect attention behind the wheel.
So I teach my drivers to value perfection.
It's why I have them memorize our 131-word defensive driving program perfectly, and then I have them rewrite it.
One wrong word, one misspelled word, one missing comma, it's a failed test.
It's why I do uniform inspections daily.
Undershirts are white or brown only, shoes are black or brown polished leather and frankly, don't come to my class wrinkled and expect me to let you stay.
It's why I insist that my drivers are on time.
Don't be late, not to class, not to break, not to lunch.
When you're supposed to be somewhere, be there.
You see, I do this so that my students understand that when I'm training them to drive a car and I say, "Clear every intersection," they understand that I mean every traffic signal, every cross street, every side street, every parking lot, every dirt road, every crosswalk, every intersection without fail.
Now, new students will often ask me why my class is so difficult, strict, or uniform, and the answer is simple.
You see, perfectionism is an attitude developed in the small things and then applied to the larger job.
So basically, if you can't get the little things right, you're going to fail when it counts, and when you're driving a car, it counts.
A car traveling at 55 miles an hour covers the length of an American football field in just under four and a half seconds, but just so happens to be the same amount of time it takes the average person to check a text message.
So I don't allow my drivers to lose focus, and I don't accept anything less than perfection out of them.
And you know what? I'm tired of everybody else accepting 99 percent as good enough.
I mean, being less than perfect has real consequences, doesn't it? Think about it. If the makers of our credit cards were only 99.9 percent effective, there would be over a million cards in circulation today that had the wrong information on the magnetic strip on the back.
How about this? Or, if the Webster's Dictionary was only 99.9 percent accurate, it would have 470 misspelled words in it. If our doctors were only 99.9 percent correct, then every year, 4,453,000 prescriptions would be written incorrectly, and probably even scarier, 11 newborns would be given to the wrong parents every day in the United States.
(Laughter)
And those are just the odds, thank you.
The reality is that the US government crashed a 1.4-billion-dollar aircraft because the maintenance crew only did 99 percent of their job.
Someone forgot to check a sensor.
The reality is that 16 people are now dead, 180 have now been injured, and 34 million cars are being recalled because the producers of a car airbag produced and distributed a product that they thought was, you know, good enough.
The reality is that medical errors are now the third leading cause of death in America.
250,000 people die each year because somebody who probably thought they were doing their job good enough messed up.
And you don't believe me?
Well, I can certainly understand why.
You see, it's hard for us to believe anything these days when less than 50 percent of what news pundits say is actually grounded in fact.
(Laughter)
So it comes down to this: trying our best is not good enough. So how do we change? We seek perfection and settle for nothing less.
Now, I know. I need to give you a minute on that, because I know what you've been told.
It probably goes something like, perfection is impossible for humans, so therefore, seeking perfection will not only ruin your self-esteem but it will render you a failure.
But there's the irony.
See, today we're all so afraid of that word failure, but the truth is, we need to fail. Failure is a natural stepping stone towards perfection, but at some point, because we became so afraid of that idea of failure and so afraid of that idea of perfection, we dismissed it because of what might happen to our egos when we fall short.
I mean, do you really think that failure's going to ruin you?
Or is that just the easy answer that gets us slow websites, scary healthcare and dangerous roads?
I mean, are you ready to make perfection the bad guy in all this?
Look, failure and imperfection are basically the same thing.
We all know that imperfection exists all around us.
Nothing and nobody is perfect.
But at some point, because it was too difficult or too painful, we decided to dismiss our natural ability to deal with failure and replace it with a lower acceptance level.
And now we're all forced to sit back and just accept this new norm or good-enough attitude and the results that come with it.
So even with all that said, people will still tell me, you know, "Didn't the medical staff, the maintenance crew, the engineer, didn't they try their best, and isn't that good enough?" Well, truthfully, not for me and especially not in these examples.
Yeah, but, you know, trying to be perfect is so stressful, right?
And, you know, Oprah talked about it, universities study it, I bet your high school counselor even warned you about it.
Stress is bad for us, isn't it?
Well, maybe, but to say that seeking perfection is too stressful is like saying that exercise is too exhausting.
In both cases, if you want the results, you've got to endure the pain.
So truthfully, saying that seeking perfection is too stressful is just an excuse to be lazy.
But here's the really scary part.
Today, doctors, therapists and the nearly 10-billion- dollar-a-year self-help industry are all advocating against the idea of perfection under this guise that somehow not trying to be perfect will save your self-esteem and protect your ego.
But, see, it's not working, because the self-help industry today has a higher recidivism rate because it's more focused on teaching you how to accept being a failure and lower your acceptance level than it is about pushing you to be perfect.
See, these doctors, therapists and self-help gurus are all focused on a symptom and not the illness.
The true illness in our society today is our unwillingness to confront failure.
See, we're more comfortable resting on our efforts than we are with focusing on our results.
Like at Dublin Jerome High School in Ohio, where they name 30 percent of a graduating class valedictorian.
I mean, come on, right?
Somebody had the highest GPA.
I guarantee you it wasn't a 72-way tie.
(Laughter)
But, see, we're more comfortable offering up an equal outcome than we are with confronting the failure, the loser or the underachiever.
And when everybody gets a prize, everybody advances, or everybody gets a pay raise despite results, the perfectionist in all of us is left to wonder, what do I have to do to get better?
How do I raise above the crowd?
And see, if we continue to cultivate this culture, where nobody fails or nobody is told that they will fail, then nobody's going to reach their potential, either.
Failure and loss are necessary for success.
It's the acceptance of failure that's not.
Michelangelo is credited with saying that the greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but it's too low and we reach it.
Failure should be a motivating force, not some type of pathetic excuse to give up.
So I have an idea.
Instead of defining perfectionism as a destructive intolerance for failure, why don't we try giving it a new definition?
Why don't we try defining perfectionism as a willingness to do what is difficult to achieve what is right?
You see, then we can agree that failure is a good thing in our quest for perfection, and when we seek perfection without fear of failure, just think about what we can accomplish.
Like NBA superstar Steph Curry: he hit 77 three-point shots in a row. Think about that. The guy was able to accurately deliver a nine-and-a-half inch ball through an 18-inch rim that's suspended 10 feet in the air from nearly 24 feet away almost 80 times without failure.
Or like the computer programmers at the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, who have now written a program that uses 420,000 lines of near-flawless code to control every aspect of igniting four million pounds of rocket fuel and putting a 120-ton spaceship into orbit.
Or maybe like the researchers at the Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, who have now developed a device that can complete human genome coding in just 26 hours.
So this device is able to diagnose genetic diseases in babies and newborns sooner, giving doctors an opportunity to start treatments earlier and potentially save the baby's life.
See, that's what happens when we seek perfection.
So maybe we should be more like the professional athlete, or we should be more like that tireless programmer, or like that passionate researcher.
Then we could stop fearing failure and we could stop living in a world filled with the consequences of good enough.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"Judge, I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you something.
I been watching you and you're not two-faced.
You treat everybody the same."
That was said to me by a transgender prostitute who before I had gotten on the bench had fired her public defender, insulted the court officer and yelled at the person sitting next to her, "I don't know what you're looking at.
I look better than the girl you're with. "(Laughter) She said this to me after I said her male name low enough so that it could be picked up by the record, but I said her female name loud enough so that she could walk down the aisle towards counselor's table with dignity.
This is procedural justice, also known as procedural fairness, at its best.
You see, I am the daughter of an African-American garbageman who was born in Harlem and spent his summers in the segregated South.
Soy la hija de una peluquera dominicana.
I do that to make sure you're still paying attention. (Laughter) I'm the daughter of a Dominican beautician who came to this country for a better life for her unborn children.
My parents taught me, you treat everyone you meet with dignity and respect, no matter how they look, no matter how they dress, no matter how they spoke.
You see, the principles of fairness were taught to me at an early age, and unbeknownst to me, it would be the most important lesson that I carried with me to the Newark Municipal Court bench.
And because I was dragged off the playground at the early age of 10 to translate for family members as they began to migrate to the United States, I understand how daunting it can be for a person, a novice, to navigate any government system.
Every day across America and around the globe, people encounter our courts, and it is a place that is foreign, intimidating and often hostile towards them.
They are confused about the nature of their charges, annoyed about their encounters with the police and facing consequences that might impact their relationships, their finances and even their liberty.
Let me paint a picture for you of what it's like for the average person who encounters our courts.
First, they're annoyed as they're probed going through court security.
They finally get through court security, they walk around the building, they ask different people the same question and get different answers.
When they finally get to where they're supposed to be, it gets really bad when they encounter the courts.
What would you think if I told you that you could improve people's court experience, increase their compliance with the law and court orders, all the while increasing the public's trust in the justice system with a simple idea?
Well, that simple idea is procedural justice and it's a concept that says that if people perceive they are treated fairly and with dignity and respect, they'll obey the law.
Well, that's what Yale professor Tom Tyler found when he began to study as far back in the '70s why people obey the law.
He found that if people see the justice system as a legitimate authority to impose rules and regulations, they would follow them.
and with dignity and respect, His research concluded that people would be satisfied with the judge's rulings, even when the judge ruled against them, if they perceived that they were treated fairly
And that perception of fairness begins with what?
Begins with how judges speak to court participants.
Now, being a judge is sometimes like having a reserve seat to a tragic reality show that has no commercial interruptions and no season finale. It's true. People come before me handcuffed, drug-sick, depressed, hungry and mentally ill.
When I saw that their need for help was greater than my fear of appearing vulnerable on the bench, I realized that not only did I need to do something, but that in fact I could do something.
The good news is is that the principles of procedural justice are easy and can be implemented as quickly as tomorrow.
(Laughter) The even better news, that it can be done for free. The first principle is voice.
Give people an opportunity to speak, even when you're not going to let them speak.
Explain it. "Sir, I'm not letting you speak right now.
You don't have an attorney.
I don't want you to say anything that's going to hurt your case." For me, assigning essays to defendants has been a tremendous way of giving them voice.
I recently gave an 18-year-old college student an essay.
He lamented his underage drinking charge.
As he stood before me reading his essay, his voice cracking and his hands trembling, he said that he worried that he had become an alcoholic like his mom, who had died a couple of months prior due to alcohol-related liver disease.
You see, assigning a letter to my father, a letter to my son, "If I knew then what I know now ..." "If I believed one positive thing about myself, how would my life be different?" gives the person an opportunity to be introspective, go on the inside, which is where all the answers are anyway.
But it also gives them an opportunity to share something with the court that goes beyond their criminal record and their charges.
The next principle is neutrality.
When increasing public trust in the justice system, neutrality is paramount.
The judge cannot be perceived to be favoring one side over the other.
The judge has to make a conscious decision not to say things like, "my officer," "my prosecutor," "my defense attorney." And this is challenging when we work in environments where you have people assigned to your courts, the same people coming in and out of your courts as well.
When I think of neutrality, I'm reminded of when I was a new Rutgers Law grad and freshly minted attorney, and I entered an arbitration and I was greeted by two grey-haired men who were joking about the last game of golf they played together and planning future social outings.
I knew my client couldn't get a fair shot in that forum.
The next principle is understand.
It is critical that court participants understand the process, the consequences of the process and what's expected of them.
I like to say that legalese is the language we use to confuse. (Laughter) I am keenly aware that the people who appear before me, many of them have very little education and English is often their second language.
So I speak plain English in court.
A great example of this was when I was a young judge — oh no, I mean younger judge. (Laughter) When I was a younger judge, a senior judge comes to me, gives me a script and says, "If you think somebody has mental health issues, ask them these questions and you can get your evaluation." So the first time I saw someone who had what I thought was a mental health issue, I went for my script and I started to ask questions. "Um, sir, do you take psycho — um, psychotrop — psychotropic medication?"
(Laughter) You see, once people understand the question, they can give you valuable information that allows the court to make meaningful decisions about the cases that are before them.
The last principle is respect, that without it none of the other principles can work.
Now, respect can be as simple as, "Good afternoon, sir." "Good morning, ma'am." It's looking the person in the eye who is standing before you, especially when you're sentencing them.
It's when I say, "Um, how are you doing today?
And what's going on with you?" And not as a greeting, but as someone who is actually interested in the response.
Respect is the difference between saying, "Ma'am, are you having difficulty understanding the information in the paperwork?" versus, "You can read and write, can't you?" when you've realized there's a literacy issue.
And the good thing about respect is that it's contagious.
People see you being respectful to other folks and they impute that respect to themselves.
You see, that's what the transgender prostitute was telling me.
I'm judging you just as much as you think you may be judging me.
Now, I am not telling you what I think, I am telling you what I have lived, using procedural justice to change the culture at my courthouse and in the courtroom.
After sitting comfortably for seven months as a traffic court judge, I was advised that I was being moved to the criminal court, Part Two, criminal courtroom.
(Laughter) Now, I need you to understand, this was not good news.
It was not. Part Two was known as the worst courtroom in the city, some folks would even say in the state.
It was your typical urban courtroom with revolving door justice, you know, your regular lineup of low-level offenders -- you know, the low-hanging fruit, the drug-addicted prostitute, the mentally ill homeless person with quality-of-life tickets, the high school dropout petty drug dealer and the misguided young people -- you know, those folks doing a life sentence 30 days at a time.
Fortunately, the City of Newark decided that Newarkers deserved better, and they partnered with the Center for Court Innovation and the New Jersey Judiciary to create Newark Community Solutions, a community court program that provided alternative sanctions.
This means now a judge can sentence a defendant to punishment with assistance.
So a defendant who would otherwise get a jail sentence would now be able to get individual counseling sessions, group counseling sessions as well as community giveback, which is what we call community service.
The only problem is that this wonderful program was now coming to Newark and was going to be housed where?
Part Two, criminal courtroom.
And the attitudes there were terrible.
And the reason that the attitudes were terrible there was because everyone who was sent there understood they were being sent there as punishment.
The officers who were facing disciplinary actions at times, the public defender and prosecutor felt like they were doing a 30-day jail sentence on their rotation, the judges understood they were being hazed just like a college sorority or fraternity.
I was once told that an attorney who worked there referred to the defendants as "the scum of the earth" and then had to represent them.
I would hear things from folks like, "Oh, how could you work with those people?
They're so nasty.
You're a judge, not a social worker." But the reality is that as a society, we criminalize social ills, then sent people to a judge and say, "Do something." I decided that I was going to lead by example.
So my first foray into the approach came when a 60-something-year-old man appeared before me handcuffed.
His head was lowered and his body was showing the signs of drug withdrawal.
I asked him how long he had been addicted, and he said, "30 years." And I asked him, "Do you have any kids?" And he said, "Yeah, I have a 32-year-old son." And I said, "Oh, so you've never had the opportunity to be a father to your son because of your addiction." He began to cry.
I said, "You know what, I'm going to let you go home, and you'll come back in two weeks, and when you come back, we'll give you some assistance for your addiction." Surprisingly, two weeks passed and he was sitting the courtroom.
When he came up, he said, "Judge, I came back to court because you showed me more love than I had for myself." And I thought, my God, he heard love from the bench?
(Laughter) I could do this all day. Because the reality is that when the court behaves differently, then naturally people respond differently.
The court becomes a place you can go to for assistance, like the 60-something-year-old schizophrenic homeless woman who was in distress and fighting with the voices in her head, and barges into court, and screams, "Judge!
I just came by to see how you were doing." I had been monitoring her case for a couple of months, her compliance with her medication, and had just closed out her case a couple of weeks ago.
On this day she needed help, and she came to court.
And after four hours of coaxing by the judge, the police officers and the staff, she is convinced to get into the ambulance that will take her to crisis unit so that she can get her medication.
People become connected to their community when the court changes, like the 50-something-year-old man who told me, "Community service was terrible, Judge.
I had to clean the park, and it was full of empty heroin envelopes, and the kids had to play there." As he wrung his hands, he confessed, "Judge, I realized that it was my fault, because I used that same park to get high, and before you sent me there to do community service, I had never gone to the park when I wasn't high, so I never noticed the children playing there." Every addict in the courtroom lowered their head.
Who better to teach that lesson?
It helps the court reset its relationship with the community, like with the 20-something-year-old guy who gets a job interview through the court program.
He gets a job interview at an office cleaning company, and he comes back to court to proudly say, "Judge, I even worked in my suit after the interview, because I wanted the guy to see how bad I wanted the job." It's what happens when a person in authority treats you with dignity and respect, like the 40-something-year-old guy who struts down the aisle and says, "Judge, do you notice anything different?" And when I look up, he's pointing at his new teeth that he was able to get after getting a referral from the program, but he was able to get them to replace the old teeth that he lost as a result of years of heroin addiction.
When he looks in the mirror, now he sees somebody who is worth saving.
You see, I have a dream and that dream is that judges will use these tools to revolutionize the communities that they serve.
Now, these tools are not miracle cure-alls, but they get us light-years closer to where we want to be, and where we want to be is a place that people enter our halls of justice and believe they will be treated with dignity and respect and know that justice will be served there.
Imagine that, a simple idea.
Thank you. (Applause)
Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm transgender.
Let me take a guess at some of thoughts that might be running through your head right now. "Transgender?
Wait, does that mean that they're actually a man or actually a woman?" "I wonder if he's had the surgery yet ... Oh, now I'm looking at his crotch.
Look to the right, that's a safe place to look. "" Yes, I knew it!
No real man has hips like those. "" My friend's daughter is transgender — I wonder if they know each other. "" Oh my gosh, he is so brave.
I would totally support his right to use the men's bathroom.
Wait, but how does he use the bathroom?
How does he have sex?"
OK, OK, let's stop those hypothetical questions before we get too close for my comfort.
I mean, don't get me wrong, I did come here today to share my personal experiences being transgender, but I did not wake up this morning wanting to tell an entire audience about my sex life.
Of course, that's the problem with being trans, right?
People are pretty much always wondering how we have sex and what kind of equipment we're working with below the belt.
Being trans is awkward.
And not just because the gender I was assigned at birth mismatches the one I really am.
Being trans is awkward. because everyone else gets awkward when they're around me.
People who support me and all other trans people wholeheartedly are often so scared to say to wrong thing, so embarrassed to not know what they think they should, that they never ask.
Part of what was so nerve-racking about coming out as transgender was knowing that people wouldn't know what I meant.
And when someone comes out as gay, people know what that means, but when you come out as trans, you have to face the misconceptions that will color other people's impressions of you even after you've educated them ... And you will have to educate them.
When I came out, I wrote at 10-page encyclopedic document with a zip-file attachment of music and videos that I sent to every single person I came out to.
(Laughter)
And I kept it in my email signature for months afterwards, because you also don't ever stop coming out.
I came out to the accountant helping me with my taxes and the TSA agents who didn't know which one of them should pat me down, the man or the woman.
I mean, I just came out to everyone watching this.
When I came out to my dad, to my great relief, he was totally cool with me being trans, but as soon as I started talking about physically transitioning, he freaked.
And I quickly realized it was because he, like so many other people, think that physical transition means just one thing: the surgery.
Now, listen, if there were one magical surgery that could turn me into a tall, muscular, societally perfect image of a man overnight, I'd sign up in a heartbeat.
Unfortunately, it isn't that simple.
There are dozens of different gender-affirming surgeries from chest surgeries to bottom surgeries to facial feminization and mansculpting.
Many trans people will only ever undergo one procedure in their lifetime, if that.
Maybe because they don't personally feel the need but also because they're expensive, and health insurance is only beginning to cover them.
Instead, the first step for a trans person seeking physical transition is usually hormone replacement therapy.
Hormones are why I have a deeper voice and some sparse whiskers on my neck and a giant pimple on my chin.
Basically, they put you through a second puberty ... it's a blast.
(Laughter)
Now, because our transitions are slower and steadier than historic misconceptions can lead people to believe, there can be some confusion about when to call someone by their new name and pronouns.
There's no distinct point in physical transition at which a trans person becomes their true gender.
As soon as they tell you their new name and pronouns, that's when you start using them.
It can be difficult to make the change.
You might slip up here and there; I've slipped up myself with other trans people.
But I always think to myself, if we can change from calling Puff Daddy to P. Diddy, and if we apologize profusely when we've used the wrong gender pronoun for someone's pet cat -- I mean, I think we can make the same effort for the real humans in our lives.
Now, there is no topic that makes other people more awkward about trans people than public bathrooms.
Ah, the bathrooms -- the latest political flash point for LGBT opponents.
Here's a fun fact about bathrooms: more US congressmen have been convicted of assaulting someone in a public bathroom than trans people have been.
(Laughter)
The truth is we trans people are so much more scared of you than you are of us.
It's a huge point of discussion in trans communities about which bathroom to start using and when, so we don't attract attention that could lead to violence against us.
I personally started using the men's room when I started getting confused and frightened looks in the women's room, even though I was petrified to start going into the men's room.
And often we opt to just not go to the bathroom at all.
A 2015 national survey of trans people found that eight percent of us had had a urinary tract infection in the past year as a result of avoiding restrooms.
These bathroom bills aren't protecting anyone.
All they're doing is ensuring that when trans people are assaulted in bathrooms, the law will no longer be on our side when we report it.
Being trans means a daily onslaught of these misconceptions.
And I have it pretty easy.
I am a white, able-bodied guy sitting nearly at the peak of privilege mountain.
For non-binary people, for trans women, for trans people of color, it is so much harder.
So I've given you a starter pack of trans knowledge that I hope will lead to more learning on your own.
Talk to trans people. Listen to us. Amplify our voices. Take the heat off of us and educate those around you so we don't have to every time.
Maybe someday, when I say, "Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm transgender," the only response I'll get is, "Hi, nice to meet you."
Thank you.
(Applause)
I've been doing some thinking. I'm going to kill my dad.
I called my sister.
I've been doing some thinking. "Listen,
I'm going to kill Dad.
I'm going to take him to Oregon, find some heroin, and give it to him."
My dad has frontotemporal lobe dementia, or FTD.
It's a confusing disease that hits people in their 50s or 60s.
It can completely change someone's personality, making them paranoid and even violent.
My dad's been sick for a decade, but three years ago he got really sick, and we had to move him out of his house -- the house that I grew up in, the house that he built with his own hands.
My strapping, cool dad with the falsetto singing voice had to move into a facility for round-the-clock care when he was just 65.
At first my mom and sisters and I made the mistake of putting him in a regular nursing home.
It was really pretty; it had plush carpet and afternoon art classes and a dog named Diane.
But then I got a phone call.
"Ms. Malone, we've arrested your father."
"What?"
"Well, he threatened everybody with cutlery.
And then he yanked the curtains off the wall, and then he tried to throw plants out the window.
And then, well, he pulled all the old ladies out of their wheelchairs."
"All the old ladies?"
(Laughter)
"What a cowboy."
(Laughter)
After he got kicked out of there, we bounced him between a bunch of state-run facilities before finding a treatment center specifically for people with dementia.
At first, he kind of liked it, but over time his health declined, and one day I walked in and found him sitting hunched over on the ground wearing a onesie — those kinds of outfits that zip in the back.
I watched him for about an hour as he yanked at it, trying to find a way out of this thing.
And it's supposed to be practical, but to me it looked like a straightjacket.
And so I ran out.
I left him there.
I sat in my truck -- his old truck -- hunched over, this really deep guttural cry coming out of the pit of my belly.
I just couldn't believe that my father, the Adonis of my youth, my really dear friend, would think that this kind of life was worth living anymore.
We're programmed to prioritize productivity.
So when a person -- an Adonis in this case -- is no longer productive in the way we expect him to be, the way that he expects himself to be, what value does that life have left?
That day in the truck, all I could imagine was that my dad was being tortured and his body was the vessel of that torture.
I've got to get him out of that body.
I've got to get him out of that body; I'm going to kill Dad.
I call my sister.
"Beth," she said. "You don't want to live the rest of your life knowing that you killed your father.
And you'd be arrested I think, because he can't condone it.
And you don't even know how to buy heroin."
(Laughter)
It's true, I don't.
(Laughter) The truth is we talk about his death a lot. When will it happen? What will it be like? But I wish that we would have talked about death when we were all healthy.
What does my best death look like? What does your best death look like? But my family didn't know to do that.
And my sister was right.
I shouldn't murder Dad with heroin, but I've got to get him out of that body.
So I went to a psychic.
And then a priest, and then a support group, and they all said the same thing: sometimes people hang on when they're worried about loved ones.
Just tell them you're safe, and it's OK to go when you're ready.
So I went to see Dad. I found him hunched over on the ground in the onesie.
He was staring past me and just kind of looking at the ground.
I gave him a ginger ale and just started talking about nothing in particular, but as I was talking, he sneezed from the ginger ale. And the sneeze -- it jerked his body upright, sparking him back to life a little bit.
And he just kept drinking and sneezing and sparking, over and over and over again until it stopped.
And I heard, "Heheheheheh, heheheheheh... this is so fabulous.
This is so fabulous."
His eyes were open and he was looking at me, and I said, "Hi, Dad!" and he said, "Hiya, Beth." And I opened my mouth to tell him, right? "Dad, if you want to die, you can die.
We're all OK." But as I opened my mouth to tell him, all I could say was, "Dad!
I miss you." And then he said, "Well, I miss you, too." And then I just fell over because I'm just a mess.
So I fell over and I sat there with him because for the first time in a long time he seemed kind of OK.
And I memorized his hands, feeling so grateful that his spirit was still attached to his body.
And in that moment I realized I'm not responsible for this person.
I'm not his doctor, I'm not his mother, I'm certainly not his God, and maybe the best way to help him and me is to resume our roles as father and daughter.
And so we just sat there, calm and quiet like we've always done. Nobody was productive. Both of us are still strong.
"OK, Dad. I'm going to go, but I'll see you tomorrow."
"OK," he said. "Hey, this is a pretty nice hacienda."
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, here's a prediction. If we get our cities right, we just might survive the 21st century.
We get them wrong, and we're done for.
Cities are the most extraordinary experiment in social engineering that we humans have ever come up with.
If you live in a city, and even if you live in a slum -- which 20 percent of the world's urban population does -- you're likely to be healthier, wealthier, better educated and live longer than your country cousins.
There's a reason why three million people are moving to cities every single week.
Cities are where the future happens first.
They're open, they're creative, they're dynamic, they're democratic, they're cosmopolitan, they're sexy.
They're the perfect antidote to reactionary nationalism.
But cities have a dark side.
They take up just three percent of the world's surface area, but they account for more than 75 percent of our energy consumption, and they emit 80 percent of our greenhouse gases.
There are hundreds of thousands of people who die in our cities every single year from violence, and millions more who are killed as a result of car accidents and pollution.
In Brazil, where I live, we've got 25 of the 50 most homicidal cities on the planet.
And a quarter of our cities have chronic water shortages -- and this, in a country with 20 percent of the known water reserves.
So cities are dual-edged. Part of the problem is that, apart from a handful of megacities in the West and the Far East, we don't know that much about the thousands of cities in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia, where 90 percent of all future population growth is set to take place.
So why this knowledge gap?
Well, part of the problem is that we still see the world through the lens of nation-states.
We're still locked in a 17th-century paradigm of parochial national sovereignty.
And yet, in the 1600's, when nation-states were really coming into their own, less than one percent of the world's population resided in a city.
Today, it's 54 percent.
And by 2050, it will be closer to 70 percent.
So the world has changed.
We have these 193 nation-states, but we have easily as many cities that are beginning to rival them in power and influence.
Just look at New York. The Big Apple has 8.5 million people and an annual budget of 80 billion dollars.
Its GDP is 1.5 trillion, which puts it higher than Argentina and Australia, Nigeria and South Africa.
Its roughly 40,000 police officers means it has one of the largest police departments in the world, rivaling all but the largest nation-states.
But cities like New York or São Paulo or Johannesburg or Dhaka or Shanghai -- they're punching above their weight economically, but below their weight politically.
And that's going to have to change.
Cities are going to have to find their political voice if we want to change things.
Now, I want to talk to you a little bit about the risks that cities are facing -- some of the big mega-risks.
I'm also going to talk to you briefly about some of the solutions.
I'm going to do this using a big data visualization that was developed with Carnegie Mellon's CREATE Lab and my institute, along with many, many others.
I want you to first imagine the world not as made up of nation-states, but as made up of cities.
What you see here is every single city with a population of a quarter million people or more.
Now, without going into technical detail, the redder the circle, the more fragile that city is, and the bluer the circle, the more resilient.
Fragility occurs when the social contract comes unstuck.
And what we tend to see is a convergence of multiple kinds of risks: income inequality, poverty, youth unemployment, different issues around violence, even exposure to droughts, cyclones and earthquakes.
Now obviously, some cities are more fragile than others.
The good news, if there is any, is that fragility is not a permanent condition.
Some cities that were once the most fragile cities in the world, like Bogotá in Colombia or Ciudad Juárez in Mexico, have now fallen more around the national average.
The bad news is that fragility is deepening, especially in those parts of the world that are most vulnerable, in North Africa, the Middle East, in South Asia and Central Asia.
There, we're seeing fragility rising way beyond scales we've ever seen before.
When cities become too fragile they can collapse, tip over and fail.
And when that happens, we have explosive forms of migration: refugees.
There are more than 22 million refugees in the world today, more than at any other time since the second world war.
Now, there's not one refugee crisis; there are multiple refugee crises.
And contrary to what you might read in the news, the vast majority of refugees aren't fleeing from poor countries to wealthy countries, they're moving from poor cities into even poorer cities -- often, cities nearby.
Every single dot on this map represents an agonizing story of struggle and survival.
But I want to briefly tell you about what's not on that map, and that's internal displacement. There are more than 36 million people who have been internally displaced around the world.
These are people living in refugee-like conditions, but lacking the equivalent international protection and assistance.
And to understand their plight, I want to zoom in briefly on Syria.
Syria suffered one of the worst droughts in its history between 2007 and 2010.
More than 75 percent of its agriculture and 85 percent of its livestock were wiped out.
And in the process, over a million people moved into cities like Aleppo, Damascus and Homs.
As food prices began to rise, you also had equivalent levels of social unrest.
And when the regime of President Assad began cracking down, you had an explosion of refugees.
You also had over six million internally displaced people, many of whom when on to become refugees.
And they didn't just move to neighboring countries like Jordan or Lebanon or Turkey.
They also moved up north towards Western Europe.
See, over 1.4 million Syrians made the perilous journey through the Mediterranean and up through Turkey to find their way into two countries, primarily: Germany and Sweden.
Now, climate change -- not just drought, but also sea level rise, is probably one of the most severe existential threats that cities face.
That's because two-thirds of the world's cities are coastal.
Over 1.5 billion people live in low-lying, flood-prone coastal areas.
What you see here is a map that shows sea level rise in relation to changes in temperature.
Climate scientists predict that we're going to see anywhere between three and 30 feet of sea level rise this side of the century.
And it's not just low island nation-states that are going to suffer -- Kiribati or the Maldives or the Solomons or Sri Lanka -- and they will suffer, but also massive cities like Dhaka, like Hong Kong, like Shanghai.
Cities of 10, 20, 30 million people or more are literally going to be wiped off the face of this earth.
They're going to have to adapt, or they're going to die.
I want to take you also all the way over to the West, because this isn't just a problem in Asia or Africa or Latin America, this is a problem also in the West. This is Miami. Many of you know Miami is one of the wealthiest cities in the United States; it's also one of the most flood-prone.
That's been made painfully evident by natural disasters throughout 2017.
But Miami is built on porous limestone -- a swamp.
There's no way any kind of flood barrier is going to keep the water from seeping in.
As we scroll back, and we look across the Caribbean and along the Gulf, we begin to realize that those cities that have suffered worst from natural crises -- Port-au-Prince, New Orleans, Houston -- as severe and as awful as those situations have been, they're a dress rehearsal for what's to come.
No city is an island.
Every city is connected to its rural hinterland in complex ways -- often, in relation to the production of food.
I want to take you to the northern part of the Amazon, in Rondônia.
This is one of the world's largest terrestrial carbon sinks, processing millions of carbon every single year.
What you see here is a single road over a 30-year period.
On either side you see land being cleared for pasture, for cattle, but also for soy and sugar production.
You're seeing deforestation on a massive scale.
The red area here implies a net loss of forest over the last 14 years.
The blue, if you could see it -- there's not much -- implies there's been an incremental gain.
Now, as grim and gloomy as the situation is -- and it is -- there is a little bit of hope.
See, the Brazilian government, from the national to the state to the municipal level, has also introduced a whole range -- a lattice -- of parks and protected areas.
And while not perfect, and not always limiting encroachment, they have served to tamp back deforestation.
The same applies not just in Brazil but all across the Americas, into the United States, Canada and around the world.
So let's talk about solutions.
Despite climate denial at the highest levels, cities are taking action.
You know, when the US pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, hundreds of cities in the United States and thousands more around the world doubled down on their climate commitments.
(Applause)
And when the White House cracked down on so-called "undocumented migrants" in sanctuary cities, hundreds of cities and counties and states sat up in defiance and refused to enact that order.
(Applause)
So cities are and can take action.
But we're going to need to see a lot more of it, especially in the global south.
You see, parts of Africa and Latin America are urbanizing before they industrialize.
They're growing at three times the global average in terms their population.
And this is putting enormous strain on infrastructure and services.
Now, there is a golden opportunity.
It's a small opportunity but a golden one: in the next 10 to 20 years, to really start designing in principles of resilience into our cities.
There's not one single way of doing this, but there are a number of ways that are emerging.
And I've spoken with hundreds of urban planners, development specialists, architects and civic activists, and a number of recurring principles keep coming out.
I just want to pass on six.
First: cities need a plan and a strategy to implement it.
I mean, it sounds crazy, but the vast majority of world cities don't actually have a plan or a vision.
They're too busy putting out daily fires to think ahead strategically.
I mean, every city wants to be creative, happy, liveable, resilient -- who doesn't?
The challenge is, how do you get there?
And urban governance plays a key role.
You could do worse than take a page from the book of Singapore.
In 1971, Singapore set a 50-year urban strategy and renews it every five years.
What Singapore teaches us is not just the importance of continuity, but also the critical role of autonomy and discretion.
Cities need the power to be able to issue debt, to raise taxes, to zone effectively, to build affordable housing.
What cities need is nothing less than a devolution revolution, and this is going to require renegotiating the terms of the contract with a nation-state.
Second: you've got to go green.
Cities are already leading global decarbonization efforts.
They're investing in congestion pricing schemes, in climate reduction emission targets, in biodiversity, in parks and bikeways and walkways and everything in between.
There's an extraordinary menu of options they have to choose from.
One of the great things is, cities are already investing heavily in renewables — in solar and wind — not just in North America, but especially in Western Europe and parts of Asia.
There are more than 8,000 cities right now in the world today with solar plants.
There are 300 cities that have declared complete energy autonomy.
One of my favorite stories comes from Medellín, which invested in a municipal hydroelectric plant, which doesn't only service its local needs, but allows the city to sell excess energy back onto the national grid.
And it's not alone.
There are a thousand other cities just like it.
Third: invest in integrated and multi-use solutions.
The most successful cities are those that are going to invest in solutions that don't solve just one problem, but that solve multiple problems.
Take the case of integrated public transport.
When done well -- rapid bus transit, light rail, bikeways, walkways, boatways -- these can dramatically reduce emissions and congestion.
But they can do a lot more than that.
They can improve public health. They can reduce dispersion.
They can even increase safety.
A great example of this comes from Seoul.
You see, Seoul's population doubled over the last 30 years, but the footprint barely changed. How? Well, 75 percent of Seoul's residents get to work using what's been described as one of the most extraordinary public transport systems in the world.
And Seoul used to be car country.
Next, fourth: build densely but also sustainably.
The death of all cities is the sprawl.
Cities need to know how to build resiliently, but also in a way that's inclusive.
This is a picture right here of Dallas-Fort Worth.
And what you see is its population also doubled over the last 30 years.
But as you can see, it spread into edge cities and suburbia as far as the eye can see.
Cities need to know when not to build, so as not to reproduce urban sprawl and slums of downward accountability.
The problem with Dallas-Forth Worth is just five percent of its residents get to work using public transport -- five.
Ninety-five percent use cars, which partly explains why it's got some of the longest commuting times in North America.
Singapore, by contrast, got it right.
They built vertically and built in affordable housing to boot.
Fifth: steal. The smartest cities are nicking, pilfering, stealing, left, right and center. They don't have time to waste. They need tomorrow's technology today, and they're going to leapfrog to get there.
This is New York, but it's not just New York that's doing a lot of stealing, it's Singapore, it's Seoul, it's Medellín.
The urban renaissance is only going to be enabled when cities start borrowing from one another.
And finally: work in global coalitions.
You know, there are more than 200 inner-city coalitions in the world today.
There are more city coalitions than there are coalitions for nation-states.
Just take a look at the Global Parliament of Mayors, set up by the late Ben Barber, who was driving an urban rights movement.
Or consider the C40, a marvelous network of cities that has gathered thousands together to deliver clean energy.
Or look at the World Economic Forum, which is developing smart city protocols. Or the 100 Resilient Cities initiative, which is leading a resilience revival.
ICLEI, UCLG, Metropolis -- these are the movements of the future.
What they all realize is that when cities work together, they can amplify their voice, not just on the national stage, but on the global stage.
And with a voice comes, potentially, a vote -- and then maybe even a veto.
When nation-states default on their national sovereignty, cities have to step up.
They can't wait.
And they don't need to ask for permission.
They can exert their own sovereignty.
They understand that the local and the global have really, truly come together, that we live in a global, local world, and we need to adjust our politics accordingly.
As I travel around the world and meet mayors and civic leaders, I'm amazed by the energy, enthusiasm and effectiveness they bring to their work. They're pragmatists. They're problem-solvers. They're para-diplomats. And in this moment of extraordinary international uncertainty, when our multilateral institutions are paralyzed and our nation-states are in retreat, cities and their leaders are our new 21st-century visionaries.
They deserve -- no, they have a right to -- a seat at the table.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was four years old, my dad taught me the Taos Pueblo Hoop Dance, a traditional dance born hundreds of years ago in Southwestern USA.
A series of hoops are created out of willow wood, and they're threaded together to create formations of the natural world, showing the many beauties of life.
In this dance, you're circling in a constant spin, mimicking the movement of the Sun and the passage of time.
Watching this dance was magic to me.
Like with a time capsule, I was taking a look through a cultural window to the past.
I felt a deeper connection to how my ancestors used to look at the world around them.
Since then, I've always been obsessed with time capsules.
They take on many forms, but the common thread is that they're uncontrollably fascinating to us as human beings, because they're portals to a memory, and they hold the important power of keeping stories alive.
As a filmmaker and composer, it's been my journey to find my voice, reclaim the stories of my heritage and the past and infuse them into music and film time capsules to share.
To tell you a bit about how I found my voice, I'd like to share a bit about how I grew up.
In Southern California, I grew up in a multigenerational home, meaning I lived under the same roof as my parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents.
My mother is Dutch-Indonesian and Chinese with immigrant parents, and my father is Ojibwe and an enrolled tribal member of the Prairie Band's Potawatomi Tribe in Northeastern Kansas.
So one weekend I'd be learning how to fold dumplings, and the next, I'd be traditional-style dancing at a powwow, immersed in the powerful sounds of drums and singers.
Being surrounded by many cultures was the norm, but also a very confusing experience.
It was really hard for me to find my voice, because I never felt I was enough -- never Chinese, Dutch-Indonesian or Native enough.
Because I never felt I was a part of any community, I sought to learn the stories of my heritage and connect them together to rediscover my own.
The first medium I felt gave me a voice was music.
With layers of sounds and multiple instruments, I could create soundscapes and worlds that were much bigger than my own.
Through music, I'm inviting you into a sonic portal of my memories and emotions, and I'm holding up a mirror to yours.
One of my favorite instruments to play is the guzheng zither, a Chinese harp-like instrument.
While the hoop dance is hundreds of years old, the guzheng has more than 2,000 years of history.
I'm playing the styles that greatly influence me today, like electronic music, with an instrument that was used to play traditional folk music long ago.
And I noticed an interesting connection: the zither is tuned to the pentatonic scale, a scale that is universally known in so many parts of music around the world, including Native American folk songs.
In both Chinese and Native folk, I sense this inherent sound of longing and holding onto the past, an emotion that greatly drives the music I create today.
At the time, I wondered if I could make this feeling of immersion even more powerful, by layering visuals and music -- visuals and images on top of the music.
So I turned to internet tutorials to learn editing software, went to community college to save money and created films.
After a few years experimenting, I was 17 and had something I wanted to tell and preserve.
It started with a question: What happens when a story is forgotten?
I lead with this in my latest documentary film, "Smoke That Travels," which immerses people into the world of music, song, color and dance, as I explore my fear that a part of my identity, my Native heritage, will be forgotten in time.
Many indigenous languages are dying due to historically forced assimilation.
From the late 1800s to the early 1970s, Natives were forced into boarding schools, where they were violently punished if they practiced traditional ways or spoke their native language, most of which were orally passed down.
As of now, there are 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States, when there used to be countless more.
In my father's words, "Being Native is not about wearing long hair in braids.
It's not about feathers or beadwork.
It's about the way we all center ourselves in the world as human beings. "After traveling with this film for over a year, I met indigenous people from around the world, from the Ainu of Japan, Sami of Scandinavia, the Maori and many more.
And they were all dealing with the exact same struggle to preserve their language and culture.
At this moment, I not only realize the power storytelling has to connect all of us as human beings but the responsibility that comes with this power.
It can become incredibly dangerous when our stories are rewritten or ignored, because when we are denied identity, we become invisible.
We're all storytellers.
Reclaiming our narratives and just listening to each other's can create a portal that can transcend time itself.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I come from a family of five brothers, all scientists and engineers.
A few years ago, I sent them the following email: "Dear brothers, I hope this message finds you well.
I am emailing to let you know that I'm dropping out of my master's program in engineering to pursue a career as a full-time musician.
All that I ask from you is not to worry about me."
Brother number one replied. He was encouraging but a bit skeptical.
He said, "I wish you the best of luck.
You're going to need it."
(Laughter)
Brother number two was a little bit more skeptical.
He said, "Don't do it!
This will be the worst mistake of your life.
Find a real career."
(Laughter)
Well, the rest of my brothers were so enthusiastic about my decision, they didn't even respond.
(Laughter)
I know that the skepticism coming from my brothers is out of care and concern for me. They were worried. They thought it would be difficult to make it as an artist, that it will be a challenge. And you know what? They were right. It is such a challenge to be a full-time artist.
I have so many friends who need to have a second job as a plan B in order to pay for the bills, except that plan B sometimes becomes their plan A. And it's not just my friends and I who experience this.
The US Census Bureau states that only 10 percent of art school graduates end up working as full-time artists.
The other 90 percent, they change careers, they work in marketing, sales, education and other fields.
But this is not news, right? We almost expect the artist to be a struggling artist. But why should we expect that?
I read an article in the "Huffington Post" saying that four years ago, the European Union began the world's largest ever arts funding initiative.
Creative Europe will give 2.4 billion dollars to over 300,000 artists.
In contrast, the US budget for our National Endowment for the Arts, the largest single funder for the arts across the United States, is merely 146 million dollars.
To put things into perspective, the US budget for the military marching bands alone is almost twice as much as the entire NEA.
Another striking image comes from Brendan McMahon for the "Huffington Post," saying that out of the one trillion dollar budget for military and defense-related spending, if only 0.05 percent were allocated to the arts, we would be able to pay for 20 full-time symphony orchestras at 20 million dollars apiece, and give over 80,000 artists an annual salary of 50,000 dollars each. If that's only 0.05 percent, imagine what a full one percent could do.
Now, I know we live in a capitalist society, and profits matter a lot.
So let's look at it from a financial angle, shall we?
The US nonprofit arts industry generates more than 166 billion dollars in economic activity, it employs 5.7 million people and it returns 12.6 billion dollars in tax revenue.
But this is only a financial angle, right?
We all know that the arts is way more than just an economic value.
The arts brings meaning to life.
It's the spirit of our culture.
It brings people together and it supports creativity and social cohesion.
But if the arts contributes this much to our economy, why then do we still invest so little in arts and artists?
Why do more than 80 percent of our schools nationwide still experience budget cuts in arts education programs?
What is it about the value of arts and artists that we still don't understand?
I believe the system is flawed and far from being fair, and I want to help change that.
I want to live in a society where artists are more valued and have more cultural and financial support so they can focus on creating arts instead of being forced to drive Ubers or take corporate jobs they'd rather not have.
There are other sources of income for artists, however.
There are private foundations, grants and patrons who give money, except a vast majority of artists don't know about these opportunities.
On one side you have institutions and people with money.
On the other side you have artists seeking funding, but the artists don't know about the people with the money, and the people with the money don't necessarily know about the artists out there.
This is why I am very excited to share "Grantpa," an online platform that uses technology to match artists with grants and funding opportunities in a way that is easy, fast and less intimidating.
Grantpa is only one step towards solving an existing problem of funding inequality, but we need to work collectively on multiple fronts to reevaluate how we view the artists in our society.
Do we think of arts as a luxury or a necessity?
Do we understand what goes on in the day-to-day life of an artist, or do we still believe that artists, no matter how struggling they are, are happy simply because they're following their passion?
"Dear brothers, I hope this message finds you well. In a few years, I plan to send my brothers the following email:
I am emailing to let you know that I am doing great and so are hundreds of thousands of artists who are being valued more culturally and financially and getting enough funding to focus on their crafts and create more art.
I appreciate all of your support.
Couldn't have done it without you."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Cyndi Stivers: So, future of storytelling.
Before we do the future, let's talk about what is never going to change about storytelling.
Shonda Rhimes: What's never going to change.
Obviously, I think good stories are never going to change, the need for people to gather together and exchange their stories and to talk about the things that feel universal, the idea that we all feel a compelling need to watch stories, to tell stories, to share stories -- sort of the gathering around the campfire to discuss the things that tell each one of us that we are not alone in the world.
Those things to me are never going to change.
That essence of storytelling is never going to change.
CS: OK. In preparation for this conversation, I checked in with Susan Lyne, who was running ABC Entertainment when you were working on "Grey's Anatomy" --
SR: Yes.
CS: And she said that there was this indelible memory she had of your casting process, where without discussing it with any of the executives, you got people coming in to read for your scripts, and every one of them was the full range of humanity, you did not type anyone in any way, and that it was completely surprising.
So she said, in addition to retraining the studio executives, you also, she feels, and I think this is -- I agree, retrained the expectations of the American TV audience.
So what else does the audience not yet realize that it needs?
SR: What else does it not yet realize?
Well, I mean, I don't think we're anywhere near there yet.
I mean, we're still in a place in which we're far, far behind what looks like the real world in actuality.
I wasn't bringing in a bunch of actors who looked very different from one another simply because I was trying to make a point, and I wasn't trying to do anything special.
It never occurred to me that that was new, different or weird.
I just brought in actors because I thought they were interesting and to me, the idea that it was completely surprising to everybody -- I didn't know that for a while.
I just thought: these are the actors I want to see play these parts.
I want to see what they look like if they read.
We'll see what happens.
So I think the interesting thing that happens is that when you look at the world through another lens, when you're not the person normally in charge of things, it just comes out a different way.
CS: So you now have this big machine that you run, as a titan -- as you know, last year when she gave her talk -- she's a titan.
So what do you think is going to happen as we go on?
There's a huge amount of money involved in producing these shows.
While the tools of making stories have gone and gotten greatly democratized, there's still this large distribution: people who rent networks, who rent the audience to advertisers and make it all pay.
How do you see the business model changing now that anyone can be a storyteller?
SR: I think it's changing every day.
I mean, the rapid, rapid change that's happening is amazing.
And I feel -- the panic is palpable, and I don't mean that in a bad way.
I think it's kind of exciting.
The idea that there's sort of an equalizer happening, that sort of means that anybody can make something, is wonderful.
I think there's some scary in the idea that you can't find the good work now.
There's so much work out there.
I think there's something like 417 dramas on television right now at any given time in any given place, but you can't find them.
You can't find the good ones.
So there's a lot of bad stuff out there because everybody can make something.
It's like if everybody painted a painting.
You know, there's not that many good painters.
But finding the good stories, the good shows, is harder and harder and harder.
Because if you have one tiny show over here on AMC and one tiny show over here over there, finding where they are becomes much harder.
So I think that ferreting out the gems and finding out who made the great webisode and who made this, it's -- I mean, think about the poor critics who now are spending 24 hours a day trapped in their homes watching everything.
It's not an easy job right now.
So the distribution engines are getting more and more vast, but finding the good programming for everybody in the audience is getting harder.
And unlike the news, where everything's getting winnowed down to just who you are, television seems to be getting -- and by television I mean anything you can watch, television shows on -- seems to be getting wider and wider and wider.
And so anybody's making stories, and the geniuses are sometimes hidden.
But it's going to be harder to find, and at some point that will collapse.
People keep talking about peak TV.
I don't know when that's going to happen.
I think at some point it'll collapse a little bit and we'll, sort of, come back together.
I don't know if it will be network television.
I don't know if that model is sustainable.
CS: What about the model that Amazon and Netflix are throwing a lot of money around right now.
SR: That is true.
I think it's an interesting model.
I think there's something exciting about it.
For content creators, I think there's something exciting about it.
For the world, I think there's something exciting about it.
The idea that there are programs now that can be in multiple languages with characters from all over the world that are appealing and come out for everybody at the same time is exciting.
I mean, I think the international sense that television can now take on makes sense to me, that programming can now take on.
Television so much is made for, like -- here's our American audience.
We make these shows, and then they shove them out into the world and hope for the best, as opposed to really thinking about the fact that America is not it.
I mean, we love ourselves and everything, but it's not i.
And we should be taking into account the fact that there are all of these other places in the world that we should be interested in while we're telling stories.
It makes the world smaller.
I don't know.
I think it pushes forward the idea that the world is a universal place, and our stories become universal things.
We stop being other.
CS: You've pioneered, as far as I can see, interesting ways to launch new shows, too.
I mean, when you launched "Scandal" in 2012, there was this amazing groundswell of support on Twitter the likes of which nobody had seen before.
Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve when you launch your next one?
What do you think will happen in that regard?
SR: We do have some interesting ideas.
We have a show called "Still Star-Crossed" coming out this summer. We have some interesting ideas for that.
I'm not sure if we're going to be able to do them in time.
I thought they were fun.
But the idea that we would live-tweet our show was really just us thinking that would be fun.
We didn't realize that the critics would start to live-tweet along with us.
But the fans -- getting people to be a part of it, making it more of a campfire -- you know, when you're all on Twitter together and you're all talking together, it is more of a shared experience, and finding other ways to make that possible and finding other ways to make people feel engaged is important.
CS: So when you have all those different people making stories and only some of them are going to break through and get that audience somehow, how do you think storytellers will get paid?
SR: I actually have been struggling with this concept as well.
Is it going to be a subscriber model?
Are people going to say, like, I'm going to watch this particular person's shows, and that's how we're going to do it?
CS: I think we should buy a passport to Shondaland. Right?
SR: I don't know about that, but yeah.
That's a lot more work for me.
I do think that there are going to be different ways, but I don't know necessarily.
I mean, I'll be honest and say a lot of content creators are not necessarily interested in being distributors, mainly because what I dream of doing is creating content.
I really love to create content.
I want to get paid for it and I want to get paid the money that I deserve to get paid for it, and there's a hard part in finding that.
But I also want it to be made possible for, you know, the people who work with me, the people who work for me, everybody to sort of get paid in a way, and they're all making a living.
How it gets distributed is getting harder and harder.
CS: How about the many new tools, you know, VR, AR ... I find it fascinating that you can't really binge-watch, you can't fast-forward in those things.
What do you see as the future of those for storytelling?
SR: I spent a lot of time in the past year just exploring those, getting lots of demonstrations and paying attention.
I find them fascinating, mainly because I think that — I think most people think of them for gaming, I think most people think of them for things like action, and I think that there is a sense of intimacy that is very present in those things, the idea that — picture this, you can sit there and have a conversation with Fitz, or at least sit there while Fitz talks to you, President Fitzgerald Grant III, while he talks to you about why he's making a choice that he makes, and it's a very heartfelt moment.
And instead of you watching a television screen, you're sitting there next to him, and he's having this conversation.
Now, you fall in love with the man while he's doing it from a television screen.
Imagine sitting next to him, or being with a character like Huck who's about to execute somebody.
And instead of having a scene where, you know, he's talking to another character very rapidly, he goes into a closet and turns to you and tells you, you know, what's going to happen and why he's afraid and nervous.
It's a little more like theater, and I'm not sure it would work, but I'm fascinating by the concept of something like that and what that would mean for an audience.
And to get to play with those ideas would be interesting, and I think, you know, for my audience, the people who watch my shows, which is, you know, women 12 to 75, there's something interesting in there for them.
CS: And how about the input of the audience?
How interested are you in the things where the audience can actually go up to a certain point and then decide, oh wait, I'm going to choose my own adventure.
I'm going to run off with Fitz or I'm going to run off with --
SR: Oh, the choose- your-own-adventure stories.
I have a hard time with those, and not necessarily because I want to be in control of everything, but because when I'm watching television or I'm watching a movie, I know for a fact that a story is not as good when I have control over exactly what's going to happen to somebody else's character.
You know, if I could tell you exactly what I wanted to happen to Walter White, that's great, but the story is not the same, and it's not as powerful.
You know, if I'm in charge of how "The Sopranos" ends, then that's lovely and I have an ending that's nice and satisfying, but it's not the same story and it's not the same emotional impact.
CS: I can't stop imagining what that might be.
Sorry, you're losing me for a minute.
SR: But what's wonderful is I don't get to imagine it, because Vince has his own ending, and it makes it really powerful to know that somebody else has told.
You know, if you could decide that, you know, in "Jaws," the shark wins or something, it doesn't do what it needs to do for you.
The story is the story that is told, and you can walk away angry and you can walk away debating and you can walk away arguing, but that's why it works.
That is why it's art. Otherwise, it's just a game, and games can be art, but in a very different way.
CS: Gamers who actually sell the right to sit there and comment on what's happening, to me that's more community than storytelling.
SR: And that is its own form of campfire.
I don't discount that as a form of storytelling, but it is a group form, I suppose.
CS: All right, what about the super-super — the fact that everything's getting shorter, shorter, shorter.
And, you know, Snapchat now has something it calls shows that are one minute long.
SR: It's interesting. Part of me thinks it sounds like commercials.
I mean, it does -- like, sponsored by.
But part of me also gets it completely.
There's something really wonderful about it.
If you think about a world in which most people are watching television on their phones, if you think about a place like India, where most of the input is coming in and that's where most of the product is coming in, shorter makes sense.
If you can charge people more for shorter periods of content, some distributor has figured out a way to make a lot more money.
If you're making content, it costs less money to make it and put it out there.
And, by the way, if you're 14 and have a short attention span, like my daughter, that's what you want to see, that's what you want to make, that's how it works.
And if you do it right and it actually feels like narrative, people will hang on for it no matter what you do.
CS: I'm glad you raised your daughters, because I am wondering how are they going to consume entertainment, and also not just entertainment, but news, too.
When they're not -- I mean, the algorithmic robot overlords are going to feed them what they've already done.
How do you think we will correct for that and make people well-rounded citizens?
SR: Well, me and how I correct for it is completely different than how somebody else might do it.
CS: Feel free to speculate.
SR: I really don't know how we're going to do it in the future.
I mean, my poor children have been the subject of all of my experiments.
We're still doing what I call "Amish summers" where I turn off all electronics and pack away all their computers and stuff and watch them scream for a while until they settle down into, like, an electronic-free summer.
But honestly, it's a very hard world in which now, as grown-ups, we're so interested in watching our own thing, and we don't even know that we're being fed, sometimes, just our own opinions.
You know, the way it's working now, you're watching a feed, and the feeds are being corrected so that you're only getting your own opinions and you're feeling more and more right about yourself.
So how do you really start to discern? It's getting a little bit disturbing. So maybe it'll overcorrect, maybe it'll all explode, or maybe we'll all just become -- I hate to be negative about it, but maybe we'll all just become more idiotic.
(Cyndi laughs)
CS: Yeah, can you picture any corrective that you could do with scripted, fictional work?
SR: I think a lot about the fact that television has the power to educate people in a powerful way, and when you're watching television -- for instance, they do studies about medical shows.
I think it's 87 percent, 87 percent of people get most of their knowledge about medicine and medical facts from medical shows, much more so than they do from their doctors, than from articles.
So we work really hard to be accurate, and every time we make a mistake, I feel really guilty, like we're going to do something bad, but we also give a lot of good medical information.
There are so many other ways to give information on those shows.
People are being entertained and maybe they don't want to read the news, but there are a lot of ways to give fair information out on those shows, not in some creepy, like, we're going to control people's minds way, but in a way that's sort of very interesting and intelligent and not about pushing one side's version or the other, like, giving out the truth.
It would be strange, though, if television drama was how we were giving the news.
CS: It would be strange, but I gather a lot of what you've written as fiction has become prediction this season?
SR: You know, "Scandal" has been very disturbing for that reason.
We have this show that's about politics gone mad, and basically the way we've always told the show -- you know, everybody pays attention to the papers. We read everything. We talk about everything.
We have lots of friends in Washington.
And we'd always sort of done our show as a speculation.
We'd sit in the room and think, what would happen if the wheels came off the bus and everything went crazy?
And that was always great, except now it felt like the wheels were coming off the bus and things were actually going crazy, so the things that we were speculating were really coming true.
I mean, our season this year was going to end with the Russians controlling the American election, and we'd written it, we'd planned for it, it was all there, and then the Russians were suspected of being involved in the American election and we suddenly had to change what we were going to do for our season.
I walked in and I was like, "That scene where our mystery woman starts speaking Russian?
We have to fix that and figure out what we're going to do." That just comes from extrapolating out from what we thought was going to happen, or what we thought was crazy.
CS: That's great.
So where else in US or elsewhere in the world do you look?
Who is doing interesting storytelling right now?
SR: I don't know, there's a lot of interesting stuff out there.
Obviously British television is always amazing and always does interesting things.
I don't get to watch a lot of TV, mainly because I'm busy working.
And I pretty much try not to watch very much television at all, even American television, until I'm done with a season, because things start to creep into my head otherwise.
I start to wonder, like, why can't our characters wear crowns and talk about being on a throne? It gets crazy. So I try not to watch much until the seasons are over.
But I do think that there's a lot of interesting European television out there.
I was at the International Emmys and looking around and seeing the stuff that they were showing, and I was kind of fascinated.
There's some stuff I want to watch and check out.
CS: Can you imagine -- I know that you don't spend a lot of time thinking about tech stuff, but you know how a few years ago we had someone here at TED talking about seeing, wearing Google Glass and seeing your TV shows essentially in your eye?
Do you ever fantasize when, you know -- the little girl who sat on the pantry floor in your parents' house, did you ever imagine any other medium?
Or would you now?
SR: Any other medium.
For storytelling, other than books?
I mean, I grew up wanting to be Toni Morrison, so no.
I mean, I didn't even imagine television.
So the idea that there could be some bigger world, some more magical way of making things --- I'm always excited when new technology comes out and I'm always the first one to want to try it.
The possibilities feel endless and exciting right now, which is what excites me.
We're in this sort of Wild West period, to me, it feels like, because nobody knows what we're going to settle on.
You can put stories anywhere right now and that's cool to me, and it feels like once we figure out how to get the technology and the creativity of storytelling to meet, the possibilities are endless.
CS: And also the technology has enabled the thing I briefly flew by earlier, binge-viewing, which is a recent phenomenon, since you've been doing shows, right?
And how do you think does that change the storytelling process at all?
You always had a bible for the whole season beforehand, right?
SR: No, I just always knew where we were going to end.
So for me, the only way I can really comment on that is that I have a show that's been going on for 14 seasons and so there are the people who have been watching it for 14 seasons, and then there are the 12-year-old girls I'd encounter in the grocery store who had watched 297 episodes in three weeks.
Seriously, and that's a very different experience for them, because they've been inside of something really intensely for a very short period of time in a very intense way, and to them the story has a completely different arc and a completely different meaning because it never had any breaks.
CS: It's like visiting a country and then leaving it. It's a strange --
SR: It's like reading an amazing novel and then putting it down.
I think that is the beauty of the experience.
You don't necessarily have to watch something for 14 seasons.
It's not necessarily the way everything's supposed to be.
CS: Is there any topic that you don't think we should touch?
SR: I don't think I think of story that way.
I think of story in terms of character and what characters would do and what characters need to do in order to make them move forward, so I'm never really thinking of story in terms of just plot, and when writers come into my writer's room and pitch me plot, I say, "You're not speaking English." Like, that's the thing I say.
We're not speaking English.
I need to hear what's real.
And so I don't think of it that way.
I don't know if there's a way to think there's something I wouldn't do because that feels like I'm plucking pieces of plot off a wall or something.
CS: That's great.
To what extent do you think you will use — You know, you recently went on the board of Planned Parenthood and got involved in the Hillary Clinton campaign.
To what extent do you think you will use your storytelling in the real world to effect change?
SR: Well, you know, there's -- That's an intense subject to me, because I feel like the lack of narrative that a lot of people have is difficult.
You know, like, there's a lot of organizations that don't have a positive narrative that they've created for themselves that would help them.
There's a lot of campaigns that could be helped with a better narrative.
The Democrats could do a lot with a very strong narrative for themselves.
There's a lot of different things that could happen in terms of using storytelling voice, and I don't mean that in a fiction way, I mean that in a same way that any speechwriter would mean it.
And I see that, but I don't necessarily know that that's, like, my job to do that.
CS: All right.
Please help me thank Shonda. SR: Thank you.
A few years ago, about seven years ago, I found myself hiding in a festival toilet, a music festival toilet, and if anyone's been to a music festival, yeah, you'll know that by the third day, it's pretty nasty.
I was standing in the toilet because I couldn't even sit down, because the toilet roll had run out, there was mud everywhere, and it smelled pretty bad.
And I stood there thinking, "What am I doing?
I don't even need the toilet. "
But the reason I went was because I was volunteering for a large charity on climate justice, and it was seven years ago, when lots of people didn't believe in climate change, people were very cynical about activism, and my role, with all of my teammates, was to get people to sign petitions on climate justice and educate them a bit more about the issue.
And I cared deeply about climate change and lots of inequality, so I'd go and I'd talk to lots of people, which made me nervous and drained me of energy, but I did it because I cared, but I would hide in the toilets, because I'd be exhausted, and I didn't want my teammates doubting my commitment to the cause, thinking that I was slacking.
And we'd go and meet at the end of our shift, and we'd count how many petitions had been signed, and often I'd win the amount of petitions signed even though I had my little breaks in the toilet.
But I was always very jealous of the other activists, because either they had the same amount of energy as they had when they began the shift of getting people to sign petitions, or often they had more energy, and they'd be really excited about going to watch the bands in the evening and having a dance.
And even if I loved the bands, all I wanted to do was to go back to my tent and have a sleep, because I'd just feel completely wiped out, and I was really jealous of people that had the energy to go and party hard at the festivals.
But it also made me really angry, as well, inside.
I thought, "This isn't fair, I'm an introvert, and all of the offline campaigning seems to be favoring extroverts." I would go on marches which drained me.
That was the other option.
Or I'd go and join campaigns outside embassies or shops.
The only thing that was on offer was around lots of people, it was very loud activism, it always involved lots of people, it was performing.
None of it was for introverts, and I not only thought that that wasn't fair, because a third to a half of the world's population are introverts, which isn't fair on them, because we burn out, or we'd be put off by activism and not do it, and everyone needs to be an activist in this world.
And also, I didn't think it was particularly clever, but I could see that a lot of the activism that worked wasn't only extrovert activism.
It wasn't only the loud stuff. It wasn't about people performing all the time.
A lot of the work that was needed was in the background, was hidden, wasn't seen.
And when I ended up just being a campaigner, because it's the only job I can do, really -- I was campaigning at university, and for the last 10 years, I've been a professional campaigner for large charities, and now I'm a creative campaigner consultant for different charities as well as other work I do -- but I knew that there were other forms of activism that were needed.
I started tinkering about seven years ago to see what quieter forms of activism I could engage with so I didn't burn out as an activist, but also to look at some of the issues I was concerned about in campaigning.
I was very lucky that, when I worked for Oxfam and other big charities, I could read lots of big reports on what influenced politicians and businesses and the general public, what campaigns worked really well, which ones didn't.
And I'm a bit of a geek, so I look at all of that stuff, and I wanted to tinker around to see how I could engage people in social change in a different way, because I think if we want the world to be more beautiful, kind and just, then our activism should be beautiful, kind and just, and often it's not.
And today, I just want to talk about three ways that I think activism needs introverts.
I think there's lot of other ways, but I'm just going to talk about three.
And the first one is: activism is often very quick, and it's about doing, so extroverts, often their immediate response to injustice is, we've got to do stuff now, we've got to react really quickly -- and yes, we do need to react, but we need to be strategic in our campaigning, and if we just act on anger, often we do the wrong things.
I use craft, like needlework -- like this guy behind me is doing -- as a way to not only slow down those extrovert doers, but also to bring in nervous, quiet introverts into activism.
By doing repetitive actions, like handicraft, you can't do it fast, you have to do it slowly.
And those repetitive stitches help you meditate on the big, complex, messy social change issues and figure out what we can do as a citizen, as a consumer, as a constituent, and all of those different things.
It helps you think critically while you're stitching away, and it helps you be more mindful of what are your motives.
Are you that Barbie aid worker that was mentioned before?
Are you about joining people in solidarity, or do you want to be the savior, which often isn't very ethical?
But doing needle work together, as well, extroverts and introverts and ambivert — everyone's on the scale in different places — because it's a quiet, slow form of activism, it really helps introverts be heard in other areas, where they are often not heard.
It sounds odd, but while you're stitching, you don't need eye contact with people.
So, for nervous introverts, it means that you can stitch away next to someone or a group of people and ask questions that you're thinking that often you don't get time to ask people, or you're too nervous to ask if you give them eye contact.
So you can get introverts, who are those big, deep thinkers, saying, "That's really interesting that you want to do that extrovert form of activism that's about shaming people or quickly going out somewhere, but who are you trying to target and how, and is that the best way to do it?" So it means you could have these discussions in a very slow way, which is great for the extrovert to slow down and think deeply, but it's really good for the introvert as well, to be heard and to feel part of that movement for change, in a good way.
Some ways we do it is stitch cards about what values we thread through our activism, and making sure that we don't just react in unethical ways.
One, sometimes we work with art institutions where we will get over 150 people at the V & amp; A who can come for hours, sit and stitch together on a particular issue, and then tweet what they're thinking or how it went, like this one.
Also, I always think that activism needs introverts because we're really good at intimate activism.
So we're good at slow activism, and we're really good at intimate activism, and if this year has told us anything, it's told us that we need to, when we're engaging power holders, we need to engage them by listening to people we disagree with, by building bridges not walls -- walls or wars -- and by being critical friends, not aggressive enemies.
And one example that I do a lot with introverts, but with lots of people, is make gifts for people in power, so not be outside screaming at them, but to give them something like a bespoke handkerchief saying, "Don't blow it.
Use your power for good.
We know you've got a difficult job in your position of power.
How can we help you?" And what's great is, for the introverts, we can write letters while we're making these gifts, so for us, Marks and Spencer, we tried to campaign to get them to implement the living wage.
So we made all the 14 board members bespoke handkerchiefs.
We wrote them letters, we boxed them up, and we went to the AGM to hand-deliver our gifts and to have that form of intimate activism where we had discussions with them.
And what was brilliant was that the chair of the board told us how amazing our campaign was, how heartfelt it was.
The board members, like Martha Lane Fox, who has hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter, and highly influential in business, tweeted how impressed she was, and within 10 months, we'd had meetings with Marks and Spencer to say, "We know this is difficult to be a living wage employer, but if you can be one, the rest of the sector will look at it, and it's not right that some of your amazing workers are working full time and still can't pay their bills.
And we love Marks and Spencer.
How can you be the role model that we want you to be?"
So that was that intimate form of activism.
We had lots of meetings with them.
We then gave them Christmas cards and Valentine's cards to say, "We really want to encourage you to implement the living wage, and within 10 months, they'd announced to the media that they were going to pay the independent living wage, and now —
(Applause)
Thank you.
And now we're trying to work with them to be accredited, which is really important, and we went back to the last AGM this June and we had these amazing one-to-one discussions with the board members, who told us how much they loved their hankies and how it really moved them, what we were doing, and they all told us that if we were standing outside screaming at them and not being gentle in our protest, they wouldn't have even listened to us, never mind had those discussions with us.
And I think introverts are really good at intimate activism because we like to listen, we like one-to-ones, we don't like small talks, we like those big, juicy issues to discuss with people, we don't like conflict, so we avoid it at all costs, which is really important when we're trying to engage power holders, not to be conflicting with them all the time.
The third way I think activists are really missing out if they don't engage introverts is that introverts, like I said, can be half of the world's population, and most of us won't say that we're introvert, or we get embarrassed by saying what overwhelms us.
So for me, a few years ago, my mom used to send me texts in capital letters -- and she can now do emojis and everything, she's fine -- but as soon as I'd see this text, I'd wince and think, "Ooh, it's capital letters, it's too much." And I'd have to ignore it to read the lovely text she sent me.
And that's a bit embarrassing, to tell people that capital letters overwhelm you, but we really need introverts to help us do intriguing activism that attracts them rather than puts them off.
We're put off by big and brash giant posters and capital letters and explanation marks telling us what to do and vying for our attention.
So some of the things I do with people around the world who take part is make small bits of provocative street art which are hung off eye level, very small, and they're provocative messages.
They're not preaching at people or telling them what to do.
They're just getting people to engage in different ways, and think for themselves, because we don't like to be told what to do.
It might be wearing a green heart on your sleeve saying what you love and how climate change will affect it, and we'll wear it, and if people say, "Why are you wearing a green heart with the word 'chocolate' on?" and we can have those one-to-one intimate conversations and say, "I love chocolate.
Climate change is going to affect it, and I think there's lot of other things that climate change will affect, and I really want to make sure I'm part of the solution, not the problem." And then we deflect, because we don't like to be the center of attention, and say, "What do you love and how will climate change affect it?"
Or it might be shop-dropping instead of shop-lifting, where we'll make little mini-scrolls with lovely stories on about what's the story behind your clothes.
Is it a joyful story of how it's made, or is it a torturous one?
And we'll just drop them in little pockets in shops, all lowercase, all handwritten, with kisses and smiley faces in ribbon, and then people are excited that they found it.
And we often drop them in unethical shops or in front pockets, and it's a way that we can do offline campaigning that engages us and doesn't burn us out, but also engages other people in an intriguing way online and offline.
So I've got two calls to action, for the introverts and for the extroverts.
For the ambivert, you're involved in all of it.
For the extroverts, I want to say that when you're planning a campaign, think about introverts.
Think about how valuable our skills are, just as much as extroverts'.
We're good at slowing down and thinking deeply, and the detail of issues, we're really good at bringing them out.
We're good at intimate activism, so use us in that way.
And we're good at intriguing people by doing strange little things that help create conversations and thought.
Introverts, my call to action for you is, I know you like being on your own, I know you like being in your head, but activism needs you, so sometimes you've got to get out there.
It doesn't mean that you've got to turn into an extrovert and burn out, because that's no use for anyone, but what it does mean is that you should value the skills and the traits that you have that activism needs.
So for everyone in this room, whether you're an extrovert or an introvert or an ambivert, the world needs you now more than ever, and you've got no excuse not to get involved.
Thanks.
(Applause)
Stephanie Busari: President Ameenah, thank you for joining us.
Even as TED speakers go, you're something of an overachiever.
SB: You have a PhD in organic chemistry, you were vice chancellor of the University of Mauritius, a successful entrepreneur, you've won numerous awards for your work in science and you're the first Muslim female head of state in Africa.
(Applause)
And of course, you're no stranger to the TEDGlobal stage; you gave a talk in 2014.
Did you have any political ambitions at that time?
How did you go from academic to president?
AGF: OK, thanks, Stephanie. First of all, I'd like to thank TED for having given me the opportunity to be here today.
And I would also like to thank the government of Tanzania and the president for the welcome.
And also, I'd like to thank the contribution of our consul, Mr. Rizvi, who's here, has been very supportive for all our stay here.
Now, to answer your question, did I have any ambitions in politics?
The straight answer is no.
I did not choose the world of politics; the world of politics chose me.
So here I am.
SB: So, was there ever anything in your journey that ever made you think that one day you would become president of your country?
Did you ever imagine that?
AGF: Absolutely not. I think the journey started immediately after TED, actually.
When I went back, this journalist called me and said, "You know, your name has been cited for the president of the republic," I said, "Ma'am, you must be mistaken, because I have no ambition whatsoever." She said, "No, it's serious.
Can you come and tell me this in the form of a declaration?
So, OK, you'll come? "So, of course, as good journalists go, the next day I see my TED picture and, with my name, Ameenah Gurib-Fakim," For president? "A very small interrogation mark — and people don't see the interrogation mark, they just see my name and they see my picture.
And that was a sounding board.
And again, as you have just said, it was a very interesting scenario because it was a scenario where they wanted to have somebody who was credible, had this political neutrality and at the same time, was for a minority because Islam is a minority religion in Mauritius, because in Mauritius, we stratify people's origins by virtue of their religious belief.
And -- I was a woman.
So this made it all very interesting.
So there we go, and this whole campaign started, and then people said, "Why not?" Now, this is very important to note, Stephanie, because normally, the president is elected after the election.
And here we had a scenario where the name of the president was flagged before the election process, during the campaign.
So when people voted, they knew that at some point, they would have this Muslim woman president.
SB: Does it feel significant to you as a woman to be the first female president of your country?
AGF: It's important for many reasons.
I think, obviously, you just mentioned the terrible statistics of two female presidents in the whole of Africa.
But more importantly, I think it's important also coming from the background I come from -- by background I mean not ethnic, but more academic and entrepreneurial -- to be there, to be that role model for that little girl growing in my village to say, "Yes, it's possible." It's possible.
It's also important, Stephanie, while I talk about diversity -- diversity in the widest sense of the word.
We've seen that whenever there was diversity, whenever there was openness, whenever there was dialogue, this was the time when societies have been most productive.
When we talk about the Arab Golden Age, we cannot not think of Ibn Sina, al-Haytham, Averroes, Maimonides.
This was a time when cultures, religions -- they were talking to each other.
They were at peace with each other.
And this was a time when they were highly productive.
So I would say: bring down these walls.
SB: Absolutely, absolutely.
(Applause)
AGF: Virtual or otherwise.
SB: Let's also talk about another conflict area which you straddle quite interestingly.
As a woman of faith and also a scientist, you know, faith and science seem to be at loggerheads.
It wasn't always so, but I'm interested to get your thoughts on how you reconcile both and how they coexist for you personally.
AGF: They're not mutually exclusive.
I mean, if you're a scientist, you tend to really look at the perfection of the human body, the way it functions.
If you look at nature as a whole.
I'm still amazed at the perfection with which the entire ecosystem functions together.
However, to the purists, to those who are of faith, they will tell you, "Yes, there has been evolution." Even the Pope has agreed that evolution exists.
But there's always the question: What came first?
What came before this?
When we talk about all the various strata of evolution, we'll always be asking the question, there must be something before.
So I'm of the opinion that yes, there is this great spiritual force which is guiding the process, and things like this don't happen by chance.
Now, whether you call it religiosity, whether you call this great spirit by any name -- Brahma, Allah, the Holy Trinity -- you name it -- but I still think that these two are not mutually exclusive.
They can still coexist with each other.
SB: So let's move to one of your passions -- science.
You've made no secret of that.
And you've always been passionate about science.
I read that when you were a very young girl, you went to a career guidance counselor and told them you wanted to become a chemist, and they said, "No, it's for boys.
Boys do science." Did that make you even more determined to study science and to succeed in that field? How did you respond to that?
AGF: Well, to begin with, I must say, before I came to that career guidance officer, I had great teachers who motivated.
And this is something I would like to draw attention to again, to our education system.
We have to do away with this rote learning.
We have to ensure that we drive this curiosity in the child, and they need to be curious.
And if we want to move along the line for them to become great scientists, they need to become more and more curious in everything they do.
So every time -- exactly -- I went to see the careers guidance, he looked at me and said, "What do you want to do?" I said, "I want to study chemistry." "Well, you shouldn't study chemistry because this is for boys.
And the next thing, when you come back, there'll be no job for you." So I went back home, and I had a great cheerleader at home who happens to be my father.
He said, "What do you want to do?" and asked, "What did he say?" I said, "This is what he said ..." He said, "What are you going to do?" I said, "I'm going to do chemistry." So there I was.
And one thing I will say: one must always follow your heart.
And my heart was always in chemistry.
I did what I was passionate about, and I thought at some point that I had developed this thinking that if you're passionate about what you do, you will not have to work a single day in your life, until I realized it was Confucius who said that.
SB: So do you feel a responsibility, as someone in your position, to encourage young girls, especially on this continent, to study STEM subjects?
Is that something that you actively work --
AGF: You know, over the past two days, Stephanie, we've been hearing a lot of conversation about the sustainable development goals.
We've seen that, for example, Africa must be food secure, Africa must be energy secure, Africa must be water secure.
If we want to get to that level of development -- Agenda 2030 is not very far away -- if you want to have success, we need to have an educated youth in Africa.
And again, to be very cliché: you cannot achieve, you cannot win a football match, if you're going to leave 52 percent of the team outside. It's not possible.
SB: Yes.
AGF: So we need highly educated, we need female intuition, and we need to get them there.
And this is where a great deal of effort has to be done to actually motivate them from a very young age, to tell that girl that she can do anything.
And if the message comes from her father, if the message comes from her brother, it's even much more powerful.
We need to tell her that anything is possible and she can do it.
We need to build her self-confidence from a very early age, but more importantly, we also need to actually look at the books, because there are too many stereotypes.
Last year, I was very shocked when I went to a debate on Women's Day.
They had a survey, and they were asking these girls how many women inventors we have, how many women scientists do we have.
And you'd be shocked that hardly anyone knew that Ada Lovelace was there behind computer science, that Marie Curie still remains iconic with two Nobel prizes.
So there's a lot of homework to do to actually make -- to remove all these gender biases at a very young age; instill that confidence in that girl; to tell her that she can do as well if not better than her brother.
SB: Yes.
(Applause)
Thank you.
So, let's move on to an area that I know you've been very active in, which is the issue of biodiversity.
You've been quite clear that this is an area that Africa must embrace.
We have an abundance of rich her bal traditions and plants that could be developed into a big pharmaceutical industry.
Can you tell us a little bit of how you've been using your expertise to harness growth in this area?
AGF: Thank you. Yesterday, I was listening to one of the talks; it was the talk about the need for Africa to turn into a knowledge economy.
Africa has got very rich traditions.
Sub-Saharan Africa, southern Africa, has got over 5,000 medicinal plant species, not harnessed.
And, in fact, at the TED talk I gave in 2014, I came out with one sentence: "Biodiversity underpins life on earth." And if we don't look after this biodiversity, if we don't protect it, if we don't actually harness it in the right way, we are threatening our own livelihoods on this planet.
When we talk about the contribution from countries of the north to the Green Fund for the protection of our planet, it is not charity.
It is to ensure our own collective livelihoods on this planet.
So this is something that must be addressed.
Now, again, when you talk about getting this biodiversity of Africa working for us, you'd be shocked to know that out of the 1,100 blockbuster drugs that we have on the market, only 83 come from African plants. Why is this so? Because we are responsible; us Africans.
We don't value our own traditional knowledge.
We don't give it the same status as allopathic medicine.
Look at what China has done.
China has given the same status for traditional Chinese medicine as allopathic medicine, as of 2016.
Our governments, our people, have not documented, have not taken this knowledge seriously.
If you want to get serious about Africa becoming a knowledge continent, this is something that we need to address very seriously, we need to start documenting, we need to start codifying this knowledge, and unfortunately, we are racing against time because tradition in Africa is that the transmission has always been oral.
So we need to get our act together and make it happen.
SB: So there's really a sense of urgency around this.
AGF: Yes.
SB: And have you done anything yourself in respect to documenting --
AGF: Yes, I definitely did.
When I started my career in academia, one of the first things I did was I documented precisely these plants.
And I'll tell you one thing -- it was not perceived to be very serious, because here I was, in synthetic organic chemistry, going out there, talking to these grandmothers, documenting their recipes.
I mean, you can't be serious -- bringing weeds in the lab, and say, "We're going to be working on these." Are we going to get results?
So it was really a race against prejudice to try to take people's -- bring them to the table and say, "Look, this is very important." But I'm glad I did, because by that time, you start developing a crocodile skin, especially when you're a woman in the lab doing different things. You know -- you become suspect.
So I documented it; I'm very happy I did.
And now, almost 20 years since the documentation, it now constitutes prior art, and is now very well-documented at WIPO, and it is now the information which, subsequently, my company actually started working on as well.
SB: So, I watched you in the makeup room taking selfies with the makeup artist, and just being generally very accessible.
And it strikes me that you're not the kind of typical, big-man, African leader. You seem very --
AGF: You just demoted me. You called me a man.
SB: I mean your style --
(Applause)
Your style seems to be very accessible and quite unassuming.
So is this -- I mean, people tend to ask women leaders if their gender has a bearing on the way they rule, or the way they lead.
Does that apply to you?
AGF: You know, I've never taken myself seriously.
SB: OK. That's good.
(Laughter)
AGF: I still don't.
And I don't think you should take yourself seriously.
You need to have trust in what you can do, have confidence in yourself and give yourself a set of goals and just work towards them.
So the goal I've given myself is, OK, I'm leading my third life -- because I've been an academic, I've been an entrepreneur, now I'm here.
I'm hoping to have a fourth life.
So put these to work for the continent.
And this is why I have chosen to give my voice to so many initiatives that would help the youth of Africa become tech-savvy, become science-savvy, because as I said earlier on, up until they get to grips with science, with whatever is around — media, technology, you name it, all calls for a good grounding in science, technology and innovation.
I think we'll be here, 10 years, 20 years down the line, having the same conversation.
SB: Let's talk quickly about the challenges of leadership and governance.
It's hard to ignore that there's corruption on this continent with some of our leaders.
How have you confronted that in your role, and what experiences can you share with us around this issue?
AGF: We've had corruption -- corruption doesn't exist only in Africa.
Where there is a corruptee, there is a corrupter. Right? It's always a two-way process.
We have focused in my country, we are working very hard towards doing something about corruption, but, you know, they also have great people in Africa.
Why do we always focus on the negative?
Why don't we talk about... I want to bring on board, for example, the great quotes of Nelson Mandela.
His legacy is still very much alive.
We have people in -- even in Tanzania, we've had Julius Nyerere, he have Nkrumah, we have Kenyatta, we have all these people who have been champions of Africa.
I think we need to take pages of their book and see.
In fact, Julius Nyerere himself had been a great advocate for science when he said that "science will make deserts bloom." So these are some of the founding fathers of this continent; we need to take pages from them and move ahead.
(Applause)
SB: Thank you very much, President Fakim.
AGF: Thank you.
The informal markets of Africa are stereotypically seen as chaotic and lackadaisical.
The downside of hearing the word "informal" is this automatic grand association we have, which is very negative, and it's had significant consequences and economic losses, easily adding -- or subtracting -- 40 to 60 percent of the profit margin for the informal markets alone.
As part of a task of mapping the informal trade ecosystem, we've done an extensive literature review of all the reports and research on cross-border trade in East Africa, going back 20 years.
This was to prepare us for fieldwork to understand what was the problem, what was holding back informal trade in the informal sector.
What we discovered over the last 20 years was, nobody had distinguished between illicit -- which is like smuggling or contraband in the informal sector -- from the legal but unrecorded, such as tomatoes, oranges, fruit.
This criminalization -- what in Swahili refers to as "biashara," which is the trade or the commerce, versus "magendo," which is the smuggling or contraband -- this criminalization of the informal sector, in English, by not distinguishing between these aspects, easily can cost each African economy between 60 to 80 percent addition on the annual GDP growth rate, because we are not recognizing the engine of what keeps the economies running.
The informal sector is growing jobs at four times the rate of the traditional formal economy, or "modern" economy, as many call it.
It offers employment and income generation opportunities to the most "unskilled" in conventional disciplines.
But can you make a french fry machine out of an old car?
So, this, ladies and gentlemen, is what so desperately needs to be recognized.
As long as the current assumptions hold that this is criminal, this is shadow, this is illegal, there will be no attempt at integrating the informal economic ecosystem with the formal or even the global one.
I'm going to tell you a story of Teresia, a trader who overturned all our assumptions, made us question all the stereotypes that we'd gone in on, based on 20 years of literature review.
Teresia sells clothes under a tree in a town called Malaba, on the border of Uganda and Kenya.
You think it's very simple, don't you?
We'll go hang up new clothes from the branches, put out the tarp, settle down, wait for customers, and there we have it.
She was everything we were expecting according to the literature, to the research, right down to she was a single mom driven to trade, supporting her kids.
So what overturned our assumptions? What surprised us? First, Teresia paid the county government market fees every single working day for the privilege of setting up shop under her tree.
She's been doing it for seven years, and she's been getting receipts. She keeps records. We're seeing not a marginal, underprivileged, vulnerable African woman trader by the side of the road -- no.
We were seeing somebody who's keeping sales records for years; somebody who had an entire ecosystem of retail that comes in from Uganda to pick up inventory; someone who's got handcarts bringing the goods in, or the mobile money agent who comes to collect cash at the end of the evening.
Can you guess how much Teresia spends, on average, each month on inventory -- stocks of new clothes that she gets from Nairobi? One thousand five hundred US dollars. That's around 20,000 US dollars invested in trade goods and services every year.
This is Teresia, the invisible one, the hidden middle.
And she's only the first rung of the small entrepreneurs, the micro-businesses that can be found in these market towns.
At least in the larger Malaba border, she's at the first rung.
The people further up the value chain are easily running three lines of business, investing 2,500 to 3,000 US dollars every month.
So the problem turned out that it wasn't the criminalization; you can't really criminalize someone you're charging receipts from.
It's the lack of recognition of their skilled occupations.
The bank systems and structures have no means to recognize them as micro-businesses, much less the fact that, you know, her tree doesn't have a forwarding address.
So she's trapped in the middle. She's falling through the cracks of our assumptions.
You know all those microloans to help African women traders?
They're going to loan her 50 dollars or 100 dollars.
What's she going to do with it?
She spends 10 times that amount every month just on inventory -- we're not talking about the additional services or the support ecosystem.
These are the ones who fit neither the policy stereotype of the low-skilled and the marginalized, nor the white-collar, salaried office worker or civil servant with a pension that the middle classes are allegedly composed of.
Instead, what we have here are the proto-SMEs these are the fertile seeds of businesses and enterprises that keep the engines running.
They put food on your table.
Even here in this hotel, the invisible ones — the butchers, the bakers the candlestick makers — they make the machines that make your french fries and they make your beds.
These are the invisible businesswomen trading across borders, all on the side of the road, and so they're invisible to data gatherers.
And they're mashed together with the vast informal sector that doesn't bother to distinguish between smugglers and tax evaders and those running illegal whatnot, and the ladies who trade, and who put food on the table and send their kids to university.
So that's really what I'm asking here.
That's all that we need to start by doing.
Can we start by recognizing the skills, the occupations?
We could transform the informal economy by beginning with this recognition and then designing the customized doorways for them to enter or integrate with the formal, with the global, with the entire system.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
(Applause)
I was six when I had the first chance to learn what patience means.
My grandmother gave me a magic box as a birthday present, which neither of us knew would become a gift for life.
I became obsessed with magic, and at 20, I became an amateur dove magician.
This act of magic requires that I train my doves to sit and wait inside my clothing.
As a young magician, I was always in a rush to make them appear, but my teacher told me the secret to the success of this magical act is to make my doves appear only after they've waited patiently in my tuxedo.
It has to be a mindful kind of patience, the kind that took me some years to master.
When life took me to Shanghai seven years ago, the mindful patience I learned became almost impossible to practice.
In China, where everyone and everything is in a hurry, you need to outperform over 1.3 billion other people to build a better life.
You hack the system, bend the rules, circumvent the boundaries.
It is the same when it comes to food ... except that when it comes to food, impatience can have dire consequences.
In the haste to grow more, sell more, 4,000 years of agriculture in a country of rich natural resources is spoiled by the overuse of chemicals and pesticides.
In 2016, the Chinese government revealed half a million food safety violations in just nine months.
Alarmingly, one in every four diabetics in the world now comes from China.
The stories around food are scary and somewhat overwhelming, and I told myself it's time to bring a mindful patience into the impatience.
When I say mindful patience, I don't mean the ability to wait.
I mean knowing how to act while waiting.
And so, while I wait for the day when a sustainable food system becomes a reality in China, I launched one of China's first online farmers market to bring local, organically grown produce to families.
When we went live, 18 months ago, the food we could sell then was somewhat dismal.
We had no fruit and hardly any meat to sell, as none that was sent to the lab passed our zero tolerance test towards pesticides, chemicals, antibiotics and hormones.
I told our very anxious employees that we would not give up until we've met every local farmer in China.
Today, we supply 240 types of produce from 57 local farmers.
After almost one year of searching, we finally found chemical-free bananas grown in the backyards of villagers on Hainan Island.
And only two hours away from Shanghai, on an island that even Google Maps does not have coordinates for, we found a place where cows eat grass and roam free under the blue sky.
We also work hard on logistics.
We deliver our customers' orders in as fast as three hours on electric vehicles, and we use biodegradable, reusable boxes to minimize our environmental footprint.
I have no doubt that our offerings will continue to grow, but it will take time, and I know a lot more people are needed to shape the future of good food.
So last year, I founded China's first food tech accelerator and VC platform to help start-ups to shape the future of good food the way they want, be that through using edible insects as a more sustainable source of protein or using essential oils to keep food fresh for longer.
So, you may still ask: Why are you trying to build a sustainable food system by driving a patient movement in a country where it's almost a crime to take it slow?
Because, for me, the real secret to success is patience -- a mindful kind of patience that requires knowing how to act while waiting, the kind of patience I learned with my grandmother's magic box.
After all, we do not inherit the earth from our ancestors. We borrow it from our children.
Thank you.
(Applause)
"All I wanted was a much-deserved promotion, and he told me to 'Get up on the desk and spread' em. '" "All the men in my office wrote down on a piece of paper the sexual favors that I could do for them.
All I had asked for was an office with a window." "I asked for his advice about how I could get a bill out of committee; he asked me if I brought my kneepads." Those are just a few of the horrific stories that I heard from women over the last year, as I've been investigating workplace sexual harassment.
And what I found out is that it's an epidemic across the world.
It's a horrifying reality for millions of women, when all they want to do every day is go to work.
Sexual harassment doesn't discriminate.
You can wear a skirt, hospital scrubs, army fatigues.
You can be young or old, married or single, black or white.
You can be a Republican, a Democrat or an Independent.
I heard from so many women: police officers, members of our military, financial assistants, actors, engineers, lawyers, bankers, accountants, teachers ... journalists.
Sexual harassment, it turns out, is not about sex.
It's about power, and about what somebody does to you to try and take away your power.
And I'm here today to encourage you to know that you can take that power back. (Applause) On July 6, 2016, I jumped off a cliff all by myself.
It was the scariest moment of my life; an excruciating choice to make.
I fell into an abyss all alone, not knowing what would be below.
But then, something miraculous started to happen.
Thousands of women started reaching out to me to share their own stories of pain and agony and shame.
They told me that I became their voice -- they were voiceless.
And suddenly, I realized that even in the 21st century, every woman still has a story.
Like Joyce, a flight attendant supervisor whose boss, in meetings every day, would tell her about the porn that he'd watched the night before while drawing penises on his notepad.
She went to complain.
She was called "crazy" and fired.
Like Joanne, Wall Street banker.
Her male colleagues would call her that vile c-word every day.
She complained -- labeled a troublemaker, never to do another Wall Street deal again.
Like Elizabeth, an army officer.
Her male subordinates would wave one-dollar bills in her face, and say, "Dance for me!" And when she went to complain to a major, he said, "What? Only one dollar? You're worth at least five or ten!"
After reading, replying to all and crying over all of these emails, I realized I had so much work to do.
Here are the startling facts: one in three women -- that we know of -- have been sexually harassed in the workplace.
Seventy-one percent of those incidences never get reported. Why? Because when women come forward, they're still called liars and troublemakers and demeaned and trashed and demoted and blacklisted and fired.
Reporting sexual harassment can be, in many cases, career-ending.
Of all the women that reached out to me, almost none are still today working in their chosen profession, and that is outrageous.
I, too, was silent in the beginning.
It happened to me at the end of my year as Miss America, when I was meeting with a very high-ranking TV executive in New York City.
I thought he was helping me throughout the day, making a lot of phone calls.
We went to dinner, and in the back seat of a car, he suddenly lunged on top of me and stuck his tongue down my throat.
I didn't realize that to "get into the business" -- silly me -- he also intended to get into my pants.
And just a week later, when I was in Los Angeles meeting with a high-ranking publicist, it happened again.
Again, in a car.
And he took my neck in his hand, and he shoved my head so hard into his crotch, I couldn't breathe.
These are the events that suck the life out of all of your self-confidence.
These are the events that, until recently, I didn't even call assault.
And this is why we have so much work to do.
After my year as Miss America, I continued to meet a lot of well-known people, including Donald Trump.
When this picture was taken in 1988, nobody could have ever predicted where we'd be today. (Laughter) Me, fighting to end sexual harassment in the workplace; he, president of the United States in spite of it.
And shortly thereafter, I got my first gig in television news in Richmond, Virginia.
Check out that confident smile with the bright pink jacket.
(Laughter) Not so much the hair. I was working so hard to prove that blondes have a lot of brains.
But ironically, one of the first stories I covered was the Anita Hill hearings in Washington, DC.
And shortly thereafter, I, too, was sexually harassed in the workplace.
I was covering a story in rural Virginia, and when we got back into the car, my cameraman started saying to me, wondering how much I had enjoyed when he touched my breasts when he put the microphone on me.
And it went downhill from there.
I was bracing myself against the passenger door -- this was before cellphones. I was petrified. I actually envisioned myself rolling outside of that door as the car was going 50 miles per hour like I'd seen in the movies, and wondering how much it would hurt.
When the story about Harvey Weinstein came to light -- one the most well-known movie moguls in all of Hollywood -- the allegations were horrific.
(Applause) But so many women came forward, and it made me realize what I had done meant something. He had such a lame excuse.
He said he was a product of the '60s and '70s, and that that was the culture then.
Yeah, that was the culture then, and unfortunately, it still is. Why? Because of all the myths that are still associated with sexual harassment. "Women should just take another job and find another career." Yeah, right.
Tell that to the single mom working two jobs, trying to make ends meet, who's also being sexually harassed. "Women -- they bring it on themselves." By the clothes that we wear and the makeup that we put on.
Yeah, I guess those hoodies that Uber engineers wear in Silicon Valley are just so provocative. "Women make it up." Yeah, because it's so fun and rewarding to be demeaned and taken down. I would know.
"Women bring these claims because they want to be famous and rich." Our own president said that.
I bet Taylor Swift, one of the most well-known and richest singers in the world, didn't need more money or fame when she came forward with her groping case for one dollar.
And I'm so glad she did.
Breaking news: the untold story about women and sexual harassment in the workplace: women just want a safe, welcoming and harass-free environment. That's it.
(Applause) So how do we go about getting our power back?
I have three solutions.
Number one: we need to turn bystanders and enablers into allies.
Ninety-eight percent of United States corporations right now have sexual harassment training policies. Seventy percent have prevention programs.
But still, overwhelmingly, bystanders and witnesses don't come forward.
In 2016, the Harvard Business Review called it the "bystander effect." And yet — remember 9 / 11.
Millions of times we've heard, "If you see something, say something." Imagine how impactful that would be if we carried that through to bystanders in the workplace regarding sexual harassment -- to recognize and interrupt these incidences; to confront the perpetrators to their face; to help and protect the victims.
This is my shout-out to men: we need you in this fight.
And to women, too -- enablers to allies.
Number two: change the laws.
How many of you out there know whether or not you have a forced arbitration clause in your employment contract?
Not a lot of hands.
And if you don't know, you should, and here's why.
TIME Magazine calls it, right there on the screen, "The teeny tiny little print in contracts that keeps sexual harassment claims unheard." Here's what it is.
Forced arbitration takes away your Seventh Amendment right to an open jury process. It's secret. You don't get the same witnesses or depositions.
In many cases, the company picks the arbitrator for you.
There are no appeals, and only 20 percent of the time does the employee win.
But again, it's secret, so nobody ever knows what happened to you.
This is why I've been working so diligently on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC to change the laws.
And here's what I tell the Senators: sexual harassment is apolitical.
Before somebody harasses you, they don't ask you if you're a Republican or Democrat first. They just do it.
It starts when we stand tall, and we build that self-confidence.
And we stand up and we speak up, and we tell the world what happened to us.
I know it's scary, but let's do it for our kids.
Let's stop this for the next generations.
I know that I did it for my children.
They were paramount in my decision-making about whether or not I would come forward.
My beautiful children, my 12-year-old son, Christian, my 14-year-old daughter, Kaia.
And boy, did I underestimate them.
The first day of school last year happened to be the day my resolution was announced, and I was so anxious about what they would face.
My daughter came home from school and she said, "Mommy, so many people asked me what happened to you over the summer." Then she looked at me in the eyes and she said, "And mommy, I was so proud to say that you were my mom." And two weeks later, when she finally found the courage to stand up to two kids who had been making her life miserable, she came home to me and she said, "Mommy, I found the courage to do it because I saw you do it." (Applause) You see, giving the gift of courage is contagious.
And I hope that my journey has inspired you, because right now, it's the tipping point.
(Applause) We are watching history happen. More and more women are coming forward and saying, "Enough is enough." Here's my one last plea to companies.
Let's hire back all those women whose careers were lost because of some random jerk.
Because here's what I know about women: we will not longer be underestimated, intimidated or set back; we will not be silenced by the ways of the establishment or the relics of the past. No. We will stand up and speak up and have our voices heard.
We will be the women we were meant to be.
And above all, we will always be fierce. Thank you.
What if you could make your sleep more efficient?
As a sleep scientist, this is the question that has captivated me for the past 10 years.
Because while the lightbulb and technology have brought about a world of 24-hour work and productivity, it has come at the cost of our naturally occurring circadian rhythm and our body's need for sleep.
The circadian rhythm dictates our energy level throughout the day, and only recently we've been conducting a global experiment on this rhythm, which is putting our sleep health and ultimately our life quality in jeopardy.
Because of this, we aren't getting the sleep we need, with the average American sleeping a whole hour less than they did in the 1940s.
For some reason, we decided to wear it as a badge of honor that we can get by on not enough sleep.
This all adds up to a real health crisis.
Most of us know that poor sleep is linked to diseases like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, stroke and diabetes.
And if you go untreated with a sleep disorder like sleep apnea, you're more likely to get many of these illnesses.
But did you know about sleep's impact on your mental states?
Poor sleep makes us make risky, rash decisions and is a drain on our capacity for empathy.
When sleep deprivation literally makes us more sensitive to our own pain, it's not so surprising that we have a hard time relating to others and just generally being a good and healthy person when we're sleep-deprived.
Scientists are now starting to understand how not only the quantity but also the quality of sleep impacts our health and well-being.
My research focuses on what many scientists believe is the most regenerative stage of sleep: deep sleep.
We now know that generally speaking, there are three stages of sleep: light sleep, rapid eye movement or REM and deep sleep.
We measure these stages by connecting electrodes to the scalp, chin and chest.
In light sleep and REM, our brain waves are very similar to our brain waves in waking life.
But our brain waves in deep sleep have these long-burst brain waves that are very different from our waking life brain waves.
These long-burst brain waves are called delta waves.
When we don't get the deep sleep we need, it inhibits our ability to learn and for our cells and bodies to recover.
Deep sleep is how we convert all those interactions that we make during the day into our long-term memory and personalities.
As we get older, we're more likely to lose these regenerative delta waves.
So in way, deep sleep and delta waves are actually a marker for biological youth.
So naturally, I wanted to get more deep sleep for myself and I literally tried almost every gadget, gizmo, device and hack out there — consumer-grade, clinical-grade, what have you.
I learned a lot, and I found I really do need, like most people, eight hours of sleep.
I even shifted my circadian component by changing my meals, exercise and light exposure, but I still couldn't find a way to get a deeper night of sleep ... that is until I met Dr. Dmitry Gerashchenko from Harvard Medical School.
Dmitry told me about a new finding in the literature, where a lab out of Germany showed that if you could play certain sounds at the right time in people's sleep, you could actually make sleep deeper and more efficient.
And what's more, is that this lab showed that you actually could improve next-day memory performance with this sound.
Dmitry and I teamed up, and we began working on a way to build this technology.
With our research lab collaborators at Penn State, we designed experiments in order to validate our system.
And we've since received grant funding from the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health to develop this deep-sleep stimulating technology.
Here's how it works.
(Laughter)
When we detected that people were in deep sleep, we played the deep-sleep stimulating sounds that were shown to make them have deeper sleep.
I'm going to demo this sound for you right now.
(Repeating sound waves)
Pretty weird, right?
(Laughter)
So that sound is actually at the same burst frequency as your brain waves when your brain is in deep sleep.
That sound pattern actually primes your mind to have more of these regenerative delta waves.
When we asked participants the next day about the sounds, they were completely unaware that we played the sounds, yet their brains responded with more of these delta waves.
Here's an image of someone's brain waves from the study that we conducted.
See the bottom panel?
This shows the sound being played at that burst frequency.
Now look at the brain waves in the upper part of the graph.
You can see from the graph that the sound is actually producing more of these regenerative delta waves.
We learned that we could accurately track sleep without hooking people up to electrodes and make people sleep deeper.
We're continuing to develop the right sound environment and sleep habitat to improve people's sleep health.
Our sleep isn't as regenerative as it could be, but maybe one day soon, we could wear a small device and get more out of our sleep.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Most people think that new technology or advanced technology can never start in Africa.
Instead, they think that the best way to help the continent advance is by providing aid or services that the continent can't provide for itself.
So while we see advanced technology like robotics and artificial intelligence growing exponentially in the developed world, those same people are worried that a technologically backward Africa is falling behind.
That attitude couldn't be more wrong.
I'm a robotics entrepreneur who's spent a lot of time here in Africa.
And in 2014 we created Zipline, which is a company that uses electric autonomous aircraft to deliver medicine to hospitals and health centers on demand.
Last year, we launched the world's first automated delivery system operating at national scale. And guess what? We did not do that in the US, we didn't do it in Japan, and we didn't do it in Europe.
It was actually President Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Ministry of Health that made a big bet on the potential of this technology and signed a commercial contract to deliver a majority of the country's blood on demand.
(Applause)
Yeah, they deserve the applause.
So why is blood important?
Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000 units of blood a year.
So this is a product that when you need it, you really, really need it.
But blood is also challenging, because it has a very short shelf life, there are lots of different storage requirements, and it's really hard to predict the demand for all of these different blood groups before a patient actually needs something.
But the cool thing is that using this technology, Rwanda has been able to keep more blood centralized and then provide it when a patient needs something to any hospital or health center in an average of just 20 or 30 minutes.
Do you guys want to see how it works?
(Audience) Yes.
All right. Nobody believes me, so ... better to show.
This is our distribution center, which is about 20 kilometers outside of Kigali.
This actually used to be a cornfield nine months ago, and with the Rwandan government, we leveled it and built this center in a couple weeks.
So when a patient is having an emergency, a doctor or a nurse at that hospital can send us a WhatsApp, telling us what they need.
And then our team will immediately spring into action.
We pull the blood from our stock, which is delivered from the National Center for Blood Transfusion; we scan the blood into our system so the Ministry of Health knows where the blood is going; and then we'll basically pack it into a Zip, which is what we call these little autonomous airplanes that run on batteries.
And then once that Zip is ready to go, we accelerate it from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in about half of a second.
(Audience) Whoa!
And from the moment it leaves the end of the launcher, it's completely autonomous.
(Video: Air traffic controller directs traffic)
This is our air traffic controller calling it in to Kigali International Airport.
And when the Zip arrives at the hospital, it descends to about 30 feet and drops the package.
We use a really simple paper parachute -- simple things are best -- that allows the package to come to the ground gently and reliably in the same place every time.
So it's just like ride sharing; the doctors get a text message one minute before we arrive, saying, "Walk outside and receive your delivery."
(Laughter)
And then --
(Applause)
and then the doctors have what they need to save a patient's life.
This is actually watching a delivery happen from our distribution center; this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away.
We're able to watch the vehicle as it makes a delivery at a hospital in real time.
You may have noticed there are pings that are coming off of that vehicle on the screen.
Those pings are actually data packets that we're getting over the cell phone networks.
So these planes have SIM cards just like your cell phone does, and they're communicating over the cell network to tell us where they are and how they're doing at all times.
Believe it or not, we actually buy family plans --
(Laughter)
for this fleet of vehicles, because that's how we get the best rates.
(Laughter)
It's actually not a joke.
(Laughter)
So today, we're delivering about 20 percent of the national blood supply of Rwanda outside of Kigali.
We serve about 12 hospitals, and we're adding hospitals to that network at an accelerating rate.
All of those hospitals only receive blood in this way, and most of those hospitals actually place multiple orders every day.
So the reason -- in all of health care logistics, you're always trading off waste against access.
So if you want to solve waste, you keep everything centralized.
As a result, when patients are having emergencies, sometimes they don't have the medical product they need.
If you want to solve access, you stock a lot of medicine at the last mile, at hospitals or health centers, and then patients have the medicine they need.
But you end up throwing a lot of medicine out, which is very expensive.
What's so amazing is that the Rwandan government has been able to break this cycle permanently.
Because doctors can get what they need instantly, they actually stock less blood at the hospitals.
So although use of blood products has increased substantially at all the hospitals we serve, in the last nine months, zero units of blood have expired at any of these hospitals.
(Applause)
That's an amazing result.
That's actually not been achieved by any other health care system on the planet, and it happened here.
But obviously, when we're talking about delivering medical products instantly, the most important thing is patients.
Let me give you an example.
A couple months ago, a 24-year-old mother came into one of the hospitals that we serve, and she gave birth via C-section.
But that led to complications, and she started to bleed.
Luckily, the doctors had some blood of her blood type on hand that had been delivered via Zipline's routine service, and so they transfused her with a couple units of blood.
But she bled out of those units in about 10 minutes.
In this case, that mother's life is in grave danger -- in any hospital in the world.
But luckily, the doctors who were taking care of her immediately called our distribution center, they placed an emergency order, and our team actually did emergency delivery after emergency delivery after emergency delivery.
They ended up sending seven units of red blood cells, four units of plasma and two units of platelets.
That's more blood than you have in your entire body.
All of it was transfused into her, the doctors were able to stabilize her, and she is healthy today.
(Applause)
Since we launched, we've done about 400 emergency deliveries like that, and there's a story like that one behind most of those emergencies.
Here are just a couple of the moms who have received transfusions in this way in the last couple months.
We're always reminded: when we can help a doctor save a mom's life, it's not just her life that you're saving.
That's also a baby boy or a baby girl who has a mother while they're growing up.
(Applause)
But I want to be clear: postpartum hemorrhaging -- it's not a Rwanda problem, it's not a developing-world problem -- this is a global problem.
Maternal health is a challenge everywhere.
The main difference is that Rwanda was the first country to use radical technology to do something about it.
And that's the reason this attitude of Africa being disrupted or advanced technology not working here or needing aid is so totally wrong.
Africa can be the disrupter.
These small, agile, developing economies can out-innovate large, rich ones.
And they can totally leapfrog over the absence of legacy infrastructure to go straight to newer and better systems.
In 2000, if you had said that high-quality cellular networks were about to roll out across all of Africa, people would have told you that you were crazy.
And yet, no one anticipated how fast those networks were going to connect and empower people.
Today, 44 percent of the GDP of Kenya flows through M-Pesa, their mobile payment platform.
And not only that, but our autonomous fleet of vehicles relies on that cellular network.
Over the next few years as we start serving private health care facilities, we'll also use that mobile payment platform to collect fees for deliveries.
So innovation leads to more innovation leads to more innovation.
And meanwhile, most people who live in developed economies think that drone delivery is technologically impossible, let alone happening at national scale in East Africa.
And I do mean East Africa, not just Rwanda.
On Thursday, just a couple days ago, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health announced that they are going to use this same technology to provide instant delivery of a wide range of medical products to 10 million of the hardest to reach people in the country.
(Applause)
It's actually going to be the largest autonomous system anywhere in the world.
To give you a sense of what this looks like, this is one of the first distribution centers.
You can see a 75-kilometer service radius around the distribution center, and that allows us to serve hundreds of health facilities and hospitals, all of which are rural, from that single distribution center.
But to serve over 20 percent of the population of Tanzania, we're going to need multiple distribution centers.
We'll actually need four.
And from these distribution centers, we expect to be doing several hundred lifesaving deliveries every day, and this system will ultimately serve over 1,000 health facilities and hospitals in the country.
So yeah, East Africa is moving really fast.
One thing that people, I think, often miss is that these kinds of leaps generate compounding gains.
For example, Rwanda, by investing in this infrastructure for health care, now has an aerial logistics network that they can use to catalyze other parts of their economy, like agriculture or e-commerce.
Even more importantly, 100 percent of the teams we hire at these distribution centers are local.
So here's our Rwandan team, which is a group of extraordinary engineers and operators.
operating at national scale. They run the world's only automated delivery system
They have been able to master something that the largest technology companies in the world have not yet been able to figure out.
So they are total heroes.
(Applause)
They're total heroes.
Our team's mission is to deliver basic access to medicine to all seven billion people on the planet, no matter how hard it is to reach them.
We often tell people about that mission, and they say, "That's so generous of you, it's so philanthropic." No!
Philanthropy has nothing to do with it.
Because of the commercial contracts that we sign with ministries of health, these networks are 100 percent sustainable and scalable.
And the reason we feel so strongly about correcting that misperception is that entrepreneurship is the only force in human history that has lifted millions of people out of poverty.
(Applause)
No amount of foreign aid is going to sustainably employ 250 million African youth.
And the jobs that these kids may have gotten 10 years ago are largely being automated or are being changed dramatically by technology.
So they are looking for new skill sets, new competitive advantages.
They're looking for start-ups.
So why aren't there more start-ups that are tackling these global problems that are faced by billions of people in developing economies?
The reason is that investors and entrepreneurs are totally blind to the opportunity.
We think these problems are the domain of NGOs or governments, not private companies.
That's what we have to change.
You may have noticed I left something out of the video that I showed you.
I didn't show you how the planes land when they get back to the distribution center.
So, it might be obvious to you: none of our planes have landing gear.
We also don't have runways where we operate.
So we have to be able to decelerate the plane from about 100 kilometers an hour to zero in half of a second.
And the way we do that is we actually use a wire that tracks that plane as it comes in, with centimeter-level accuracy.
We snag the plane out of the sky, and then we gently plop it onto an actively inflated cushion.
This is basically a combination of an aircraft carrier and a bouncy castle.
(Laughter)
So let me show you.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And it might be obvious to you why I wanted to end with this video.
I wanted to show you the kids and the teenagers who line up on the fence every day.
They cheer every launch and every landing.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Sometimes I actually show up at the distribution center early because I'm jet-lagged.
I'll show up an hour before we begin operation.
And there will be kids on the fence getting good seats.
(Laughter)
And you go up and you ask them, "What do you think about the planes?" And they'll say, "Oh, it's a sky ambulance." So they get it.
I mean, they get it more than most adults.
So I was asking earlier: Who is going to be creating the disruptive technology companies of Africa over the next decade?
Ultimately, it's going to be up to these kids.
They are the engineers of Rwanda and Africa.
They are the engineers of our shared future.
But the only way they can build that future is if we realize that world-changing companies can scale in Africa, and that disruptive technology can start here first.
Thanks.
(Applause)
When I heard those bars slam hard, I knew it was for real. I feel confused. I feel betrayed. I feel overwhelmed. I feel silenced.
What just happened? How could they send me here?
I don't belong here.
How could they make such a huge mistake without any repercussions whatsoever to their actions?
I see large groups of women in tattered uniforms surrounded by huge walls and gates, enclosed by iron barbed wires, and I get hit by an awful stench, and I ask myself, how did I move from working in the respected financial banking sector, having worked so hard in school, to now being locked up in the largest correctional facility for women in Kenya?
My first night at Langata Women Maximum Security Prison was the toughest.
In January of 2009, I was informed that I had handled a fraudulent transaction unknowingly at the bank where I worked.
I was shocked, scared and terrified.
I would lose a career that I loved passionately.
But that was not the worst.
It got even worse than I could have ever imagined.
I got arrested, maliciously charged and prosecuted.
The absurdity of it all was the arresting officer asking me to pay him 10,000 US dollars and the case would disappear. I refused. Two and a half years on, in and out of courts, fighting to prove my innocence.
It was all over the media, in the newspapers, TV, radio.
They came to me again.
This time around, said to me, "If you give us 50,000 US dollars, the judgement will be in your favor," irrespective of the fact that there was no evidence whatsoever that I had any wrongdoing on the charges that I was up against.
I remember the events of my conviction six years ago as if it were yesterday.
The cold, hard face of the judge as she pronounced my sentence on a cold Thursday morning for a crime that I hadn't committed.
I remember holding my three-month-old beautiful daughter whom I had just named Oma, which in my dialect means "truth and justice," as that was what I had longed so much for all this time.
I dressed her in her favorite purple dress, and here she was, about to accompany me to serve this one-year sentence behind bars.
The guards did not seem sensitive to the trauma that this experience was causing me.
My dignity and humanity disappeared with the admission process.
It involved me being searched for contrabands, changed from my ordinary clothes to the prison uniform, forced to squat on the ground, a posture that I soon came to learn would form the routine of the thousands of searches, number counts, that lay ahead of me.
The women told me, "You'll adjust to this place.
You'll fit right in." I was no longer referred to as Teresa Njoroge.
The number 415 / 11 was my new identity, and I soon learned that was the case with the other women who we were sharing this space with.
And adjust I did to life on the inside: the prison food, the prison language, the prison life.
Prison is certainly no fairytale world.
What I didn't see come my way was the women and children whom we served time and shared space with, women who had been imprisoned for crimes of the system, the corruption that requires a fall guy, a scapegoat, so that the person who is responsible could go free, a broken system that routinely vilifies the vulnerable, the poorest amongst us, people who cannot afford to pay bail or bribes.
And so we moved on.
As I listened to story after story of these close to 700 women during that one year in prison, I soon realized that crime was not what had brought these women to prison, most of them, far from it.
It had started with the education system, whose supply and quality is not equal for all; lack of economic opportunities that pushes these women to petty survival crimes; the health system, social justice system, the criminal justice system.
If any of these women, who were mostly from poor backgrounds, fall through the cracks in the already broken system, the bottom of that chasm is a prison, period.
By the time I completed my one-year sentence at Langata Women Maximum Prison, I had a burning conviction to be part of the transformation to resolve the injustices that I had witnessed of women and girls who were caught up in a revolving door of a life in and out of prison due to poverty.
After my release, I set up Clean Start.
Clean Start is a social enterprise that seeks to give these women and girls a second chance.
What we do is we build bridges for them.
We go into the prisons, train them, give them skills, tools and support to enable them to be able to change their mindsets, their behaviors and their attitudes.
We also build bridges into the prisons from the corporate sector -- individuals, organizations that will partner with Clean Start to enable us to provide employment, places to call home, jobs, vocational training, for these women, girls, boys and men, upon transition back into society.
I never thought that one day I would be giving stories of the injustices that are so common within the criminal justice system, but here I am.
Every time I go back to prison, I feel a little at home, but it is the daunting work to achieve the vision that keeps me awake at night, connecting the miles to Louisiana, which is deemed as the incarceration capital of the world, carrying with me stories of hundreds of women whom I have met within the prisons, some of whom are now embracing their second chances, and others who are still on that bridge of life's journey.
I embody a line from the great Maya Angelou. "I come as one, but I stand as 10,000."
(Applause)
For my story is singular, but imagine with me the millions of people in prisons today, yearning for freedom.
Three years post my conviction and two years post my release, I got cleared by the courts of appeal of any wrongdoing.
(Applause)
Around the same time, I got blessed with my son, whom I named Uhuru, which in my dialect means "freedom."
(Applause)
Because I had finally gotten the freedom that I so longed for.
I come as one, but I stand as 10,000, encouraged by the hard-edged hope that thousands of us have come together to reform and transform the criminal justice system, encouraged that we are doing our jobs as we are meant to do them.
And let us keep doing them with no apology.
Thank you.
(Applause)
How do we get people engaged in solving global warming?
I'd like to start with running two short experiments with you all.
So your task is to notice if you feel any difference as I speak. OK? Here we go.
We are seeing rising carbon dioxide levels, now about 410 ppms.
To avoid the RCP 8.5 scenario, we need rapid decarbonization.
The global carbon budget for 66 percent likelihood to meet the two-degree target is approximately 800 gigatons.
(Laughter)
OK, now let me try something else.
We are heading for an uninhabitable earth: monster storms, killer floods, devastating wildfires, crazy heat waves that will cook us under a blazing sun.
2017 is already so unexpectedly warm, it's freaking out climate scientists.
We have a three-year window to cut emissions, three years.
If not, we will soon live in a boiling earth, a hellhole. OK. So --
(Applause)
Now your task: How did these ways of speaking make you feel?
The first, detached maybe or just confused? What's this guy talking about?
The other, fearful or just numb?
How do we get people engaged in solving global warming? So again, the question I asked:
And why don't these two ways of communicating work?
You see, the biggest obstacle to dealing with climate disruptions lies between your ears.
Building on a rapidly growing body of psychology and social science, I spent years looking into the five inner defenses that stop people from engaging.
When people hear news about the climate coming straight at them, the first defense comes up rapidly: distance.
When we hear about the climate, we hear about something far away in space -- think Arctic ice, polar bears -- far away in time -- think 2100.
It's huge and slow-moving -- think gigatons and centuries.
So it's not here. It's not now.
Since it feels so far away from me, it seems outside my circle of influence, so I feel helpless about it.
There's nothing I can do.
In our everyday lives, most of us prefer to think about nearer things, such as our jobs, our kids, how many likes we get on Facebook.
Now, that, that's real.
Next defense is doom. Climate change is usually framed as a looming disaster, bringing losses, cost and sacrifice.
That makes us fearful.
But after the first fear is gone, my brain soon wants to avoid this topic altogether.
After 30 years of scary climate change communications, more than 80 percent of media articles still use disaster framings, but people habituate to and then -- desensitize to doom overuse.
So many of us are now suffering a kind of apocalypse fatigue, getting numb from too much collapse porn.
The third defense is dissonance.
Now, if what we know, that fossil fuel use contributes to global warming, conflicts with what we do -- drive, fly, eat beef -- then so-called cognitive dissonance sets in.
This is felt as an inner discomfort.
We may feel like hypocrites.
To get rid of this discomfort, our brain starts coming up with justifications.
So I can say, for instance, "My neighbor, he has a much bigger car than I do." Or, "Changing my diet doesn't amount to anything if I am the only one to do it." Or, I could even want to doubt climate science itself. I could say, "You know, climate is always changing."
So these justifications make us all feel better, but at the expense of dismissing what we know.
Thus, behavior drives attitudes.
(Laughter) My personal cognitive dissonance comes up when I recognize that I've been flying from Oslo to New York and back to Oslo in order to speak about the climate.
For 14 minutes.
(Laughter)
So that makes me want to move on to denial.
(Laughter)
So if we keep silent, ignore or ridicule facts about climate disruptions, then we might find inner refuge from fear and guilt.
Denial doesn't really come from lack of intelligence or knowledge.
No, denial is a state of mind in which I may be aware of some troubling knowledge, but I live and act as if I don't know.
So you could call it a kind of double life, both knowing and not knowing, and often this is reinforced by others, my family or community, agreeing not to raise this tricky topic.
Finally, identity. Alarmed climate activists demand that government takes action, either with regulation or carbon taxes.
But consider what happens when people who hold conservative values, for instance, hear from an activist that government ought to expand even further.
Particularly in rich Western democracies, they are then less likely to believe that science. How is that? Well, if I hold conservative values, for instance, I probably prefer big proper cars and small government over tiny, tiny cars and huge government.
And if climate science comes and then says government should expand further, then I probably will trust that science less.
In this way, cultural identity starts to override the facts.
The values eat the facts, and my identity trumps truth any day.
So, after recognizing how these five D's kill engagement, how can we move beyond them?
New research shows how we can flip these five defenses over into key success criteria for a more brain-friendly climate communication.
So this is where it gets really exciting and where we find the five S's, the five evidence-based solutions for what does work.
First, we can flip distance to social.
We can make climate feel near, personal and urgent by bringing it home, and we can do that by spreading social norms that are positive to solutions.
If I believe my friends or neighbors, you guys, will do something, then I will, too.
We can see, for instance, this from rooftop solar panels.
They are spreading from neighbor to neighbor like a virus. It's contagious. This is the power of peer-to-peer creating the new normal.
Next, we can flip doom to supportive.
Rather than backfiring frames such as disaster and cost, we can reframe climate as being really about human health, for instance, with plant-based delicious burgers, good for you and good for the climate.
We can also reframe climate as being about new tech opportunities, about safety and about new jobs.
Solar jobs, for instance, are seeing an amazing growth.
They just passed the three million jobs mark.
Psychology says, in order to create engagement, we should present, on balance, three positive or supportive framings for each climate threat we mention.
Then we can flip dissonance to simpler actions.
This is often called nudging.
The idea is, by better choice architecture, we can make the climate-friendly behaviors default and convenient.
Let me illustrate this. Take food waste. Food waste at buffets goes way down if the plate or the box size is reduced a little, because on the smaller plate it looks full but in the big box it looks half empty, so we put more in.
So smaller plates make a big difference for food waste. And there are hundreds of smart nudges like this.
The point is, dissonance goes down as more behaviors are nudged.
Then we can flip denial by tailoring signals that visualize our progress.
We can provide motivating feedback on how well we're doing with our problem-solving.
Say you improved your transport footprint or cut energy waste in your buildings.
Then one app that can share this well is called Ducky.
The idea is, you log your actions there, and then you can see how well your team or company is doing, so you get real-time signals.
Finally, identity. We can flip identity with better stories.
Our brain loves stories.
So we need better stories of where we all want to go, and we need more stories of the heroes and heroines of all stripes that are making real change happen.
I'm proud that my hometown of Oslo is now embarking on a bold journey of electrifying all transport, whether cars, bikes or buses.
One of the people spearheading this is Christina Bu.
She is heading the Electric Vehicle Association for years and she has been fighting every day.
Now, the UK and France, India and China have also announced plans for ending the sales of fossil cars. Now, that's massive. And in Oslo, we can see how enthusiastic EV owners go and tell their electric stories to friends and neighbors and bring them along.
So we come full circle from story back to social.
So thousands of climate communicators are now starting to use these solutions all over the world.
It is clear, however, that individual solutions are not sufficient to solving climate alone, but they do build stronger bottom-up support for policies and solutions that can.
That is why engaging people is so crucial.
I started this talk with testing two ways of communicating climate with you.
There is another way, too, I'd like to share with you.
It starts with reimagining climate itself as the living air. Climate isn't really about some abstract, distant climate far, far away from us.
It's about this air that surrounds us.
This air, you can feel in this room, too, the air that moves right now in your nostrils.
This air is our earth's skin.
It's amazingly thin, compared to the size of the earth and the cosmos it shields us from, far thinner than the skin of an apple compared to its diameter.
It may look infinite when we look up, but the beautiful, breathable air is only like five to seven miles thin, a fragile wrapping around a massive ball.
Inside this skin, we're all closely connected.
The breath that you just took contained around 400,000 of the same argon atoms that Gandhi breathed during his lifetime.
Inside this thin, fluctuating, unsettled film, all of life is nourished, protected and held.
It insulates and regulates temperatures in a range that is just right for water and for life as we know it, and mediating between the blue ocean and black eternity, the clouds carry all the billions of tons of water needed for the soils.
The air fills the rivers, stirs the waters, waters the forests.
With a global weirding of the weather, there are good reasons for feeling fear and despair, yet we may first grieve today's sorry state and losses and then turn to face the future with sober eyes and determination.
The new psychology of climate action lies in letting go, not of science, but of the crutches of abstractions and doomism, and then choosing to tell the new stories.
These are the stories of how we achieve drawdown, the reversing of global warming.
These are the stories of the steps we take as peoples, cities, companies and public bodies in caring for the air in spite of strong headwinds.
These are the stories of the steps we take because they ground us in what we are as humans: earthlings inside this living air.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Leah Chase: Oh, this is beautiful.
Oh, gosh, I never saw such a room and beauty and strength like I'm looking at. That's gorgeous. It is. It is a beautiful room.
Pat Mitchell: I almost said your age, because you gave me permission, but I realized that I was about to make you a year older.
You're only 94.
LC: Yeah, I'm only 94.
I mean, you get this old and parts start wearing out.
Your legs start wearing out.
The one thing that my children always say: "But nothing happened to your mouth."
(Laughter)
So you've got to have something going, so I've got my mouth going.
(Laughter)
PM: So Mrs. Chase, the first time we were there, I brought a group of young women, who work with us at TED, into the kitchen, and we were all standing around and you had already cooked lunch for hundreds of people, as you do every day, and you looked up at them.
You have to share with this audience what you said to those young women.
LC: Well, you know, I talk to young women all the time, and it's beginning to bother me, because look how far I came.
I'd come with women that had to really hustle and work hard, and they knew how to be women.
They didn't play that man down.
And, well, we didn't have the education you have today, and God, I'm so proud when I see those women with all that education under their belt.
That's why I worked hard, tried to get everybody to use those resources.
So they just don't know their power, and I always tell them, just look at my mother, had 12 girls before she had a boy.
(Laughter)
So you know how I came out.
(Laughter)
Now, she had 14 children.
She raised 11 of us out of that 14, and up until last year, we were all still living, a bunch of old biddies, but we're still here.
(Laughter)
And sometimes we can be just cantankerous and blah blah blah blah blah, but we still go.
And I love to see women.
You don't know what it does for me to see women in the position that you're in today.
I never thought I'd see that.
I never thought I'd see women be able to take places and positions that we have today.
It is just a powerful thing.
I had a young woman come to me.
She was an African-American woman.
And I said, "Well, what do you do, honey?" She said, "I am a retired Navy pilot." Oh God, that just melted me, because I knew how hard it was to integrate that Navy.
You know, the Navy was the last thing to really be integrated, and that was done by Franklin Roosevelt as a favor to an African-American man, Lester Granger, that I knew very well.
He was the head of the National Urban League back there, and when Roosevelt asked him, he wanted to appoint Lester as maybe one of his cabinet members. Lester said, "No, I don't want that.
All I want you to do is integrate that Navy." And that was what Franklin did.
Well, Franklin didn't live to do it, but Truman did it.
But when this woman told me, "I have flown everything there is to fly," bombers, just all kinds of planes, it just melted me, you know, just to see how far women have come.
And I told her, I said, "Well, you could get into the space program." She said, "But Ms. Chase, I'm too old." She was already 60-some years old, and, you know, you're over the hill then.
(Laughter)
They don't want you flying up in the sky at 60-something years old. Stay on the ground. When I meet women, and today everybody comes to my kitchen, and you know that, and it upsets Stella, my daughter.
She doesn't like people coming in the kitchen.
But that's where I am, and that's where you're going to see me, in the kitchen.
So when they come there, I meet all kinds of people.
And that is the thing that really uplifts me, is when I meet women on the move.
When I meet women on the move, it is good for me.
Now, I'm not one of these flag-waving women.
You're not going to see me out there waving.
No, I don't do that.
(Laughter)
No, I don't do that, and I don't want any of you to do that.
Just be good women.
And you know, my mother taught us ... she was tough on us, and she said, "You know, Leah," she gave us all this plaque, "to be a good woman, you have to first look like a girl." Well, I thought I looked like a girl. "Act like a lady." That, I never learned to do.
(Laughter)
"Think like a man." Now don't act like that man; think like a man.
And "work like a dog."
(Laughter)
So we learned that the hard way.
And they taught you that.
They taught you what women had to do.
We were taught that women controlled the behavior of men.
How you act, they will act.
So you've got to do that, and I tell you all the time.
You know, don't play this man down.
It upsets me when you may have a husband that maybe he doesn't have as much education under his belt as you have, but still you can't play him down.
You've got to keep lifting him up, because you don't want to live with a mouse.
So you want that man to be a man, and do what he has to do.
And anyway, always remember, he runs on cheap gas.
(Laughter)
So fill him up with cheap gas --
(Laughter)
and then, you got him. It's just so —
(Laughter) It's just --
PM: You have to give us a minute to take that in.
(Laughter)
LC: When I heard this young lady speak before I came out -- she was so beautiful, and I wished I could be like that, and my husband, poor darling -- I lost him after we were married 70 years -- didn't agree on one thing, never did, nothing, but we got along together because he learned to understand me, and that was just hard, because he was so different.
And that lady reminded me.
I said, "If I would have just been like her, Dooky would have really loved it."
(Laughter)
But I wasn't. I was always pushy, always moving, always doing this, and he used to come to me all the time, and he said, "Honey, God's going to punish you."
(Laughter)
"You -- you're just not grateful." But it isn't that I'm not grateful, but I think, as long as you're living, you've got to keep moving, you've got to keep trying to get up and do what you've got to do.
(Applause)
You cannot sit down. You have to keep going, keep trying to do a little bit every day.
Every day, you do a little bit, try to make it better.
And that's been my whole life.
Well, I came up in the country, small town, had to do everything, had to haul the water, had to wash the clothes, do this, do that, pick the dumb strawberries, all that kind of stuff.
(Laughter)
But still, my daddy insisted that we act nice, we be kind.
And that's all.
When I heard this young woman -- oh, she sounds so beautiful -- I said, "I wish I could be like that."
PM: Mrs. Chase, we don't want you to be any different than you are.
There is no question about that.
Let me ask you.
This is why it's so wonderful to have a conversation with someone who has such a long view --
LC: A long time.
PM: to remembering Roosevelt and the person he did that favor for.
What is in your head and your mind and what you have seen and witnessed ... One of the things that it's good to remember, always, is that when you opened that restaurant, whites and blacks could not eat together in this city.
It was against the law.
And yet they did, at Dooky Chase. Tell me about that.
LC: They did, there.
Well, my mother-in-law first started this, and the reason she started is, because her husband was sickly, and he would go out -- and people from Chicago and all the places, you would call his job a numbers runner.
But in New Orleans, we are very sophisticated --
(Laughter)
so it wasn't a numbers runner, it was a lottery vendor.
(Laughter)
So you see, we put class to that.
But that's how he did it.
And he couldn't go from house to house to get his clients and all that, because he was sick, so she opened up this little sandwich shop, so she was going to take down the numbers, because he was sick a lot. He had ulcers. He was really bad for a long a time.
So she did that -- and not knowing anything, but she knew she could make a sandwich.
She knew she could cook, and she borrowed 600 dollars from a brewery.
Can you imagine starting a business today with 600 dollars and no knowledge of what you're doing?
And it always just amazed me what she could do.
She was a good money manager. That, I am not. My husband used to call me a bankrupt sister.
(Laughter)
"She'll spend everything you got." And I would, you know.
PM: But you kept the restaurant open, though, even in those times of controversy, when people were protesting and almost boycotting.
I mean, it was a controversial move that you and your husband made.
LC: It was, and I don't know how we did it, but as I said, my mother-in-law was a kind, kind person, and you didn't have any African-Americans on the police force at that time.
They were all white.
But they would come around, and she would say, "Bebe, I'm gonna fix you a little sandwich." So she would fix them a sandwich.
Today they would call that bribery.
(Laughter)
But she was just that kind of person.
She liked to do things for you. She liked to give.
So she would do that, and maybe that helped us out, because nobody ever bothered us.
We had Jim Dombrowski, Albert Ben Smith, who started all kinds of things right in that restaurant, and nobody ever bothered us.
So we just did it.
PM: Excuse me. You talked to me that day about the fact that people considered the restaurant a safe haven where they could come together, particularly if they were working on civil rights, human rights, working to change the laws.
LC: Well, because once you got inside those doors, nobody ever, ever bothered you.
The police would never come in and bother our customers, never.
So they felt safe to come there.
They could eat, they could plan.
All the Freedom Riders, that's where they planned all their meetings.
They would come and we would serve them a bowl of gumbo and fried chicken.
(Laughter)
So I said, we'd changed the course of America over a bowl of gumbo and some fried chicken.
(Applause)
I would like to invite the leaders, now, just come have a bowl of gumbo and some fried chicken, talk it over and we'd go and we'd do what we have to do.
And that's all we did.
PM: Could we send you a list to invite to lunch?
(Laughter)
LC: Yeah, invite.
Because that's what we're not doing.
We're not talking. Come together. I don't care if you're a Republican or what you are -- come together. Talk. And I know those old guys.
I was friends with those old guys, like Tip O'Neill and all of those people.
They knew how to come together and talk, and you would disagree maybe. That's OK. But you would talk, and we would come to a good thing and meet.
And so that's what we did in that restaurant.
They would plan the meeting, Oretha's mother, Oretha Haley's mother.
She was big in CORE.
Her mother worked for me for 42 years.
And she was like me.
We didn't understand the program.
Nobody our age understood this program, and we sure didn't want our children to go to jail.
Oh, that was ... oh God.
But these young people were willing to go to jail for what they believed.
We were working with Thurgood and A.P. Tureaud and all those people with the NAACP.
But that was a slow move.
We would still be out here trying to get in the door, waiting for them.
(Laughter)
PM: Is that Thurgood Marshall you're talking about?
LC: Thurgood Marshall. But I loved Thurgood. He was a good movement.
They wanted to do this without offending anybody.
I'll never forget A.P. Tureaud: "But you can't offend the white people.
Don't offend them." But these young people didn't care.
They said, "We're going.
Ready or not, we're going to do this. "And so we had to support them.
These were the children we knew, righteous children.
We had to help them.
PM: And they brought the change.
LC: And they brought the change.
You know, it was hard, but sometimes you do hard things to make changes.
PM: And you've seen so many of those changes.
The restaurant has been a bridge.
You have been a bridge between the past and now, but you don't live in the past, do you?
You live very much in the present.
LC: And that's what you have to tell young people today.
OK, you can protest, but put the past behind you.
I can't make you responsible for what your grandfather did.
That's your grandfather.
I have to build on that.
I have to make changes.
I can't stay there and say, "Oh, well, look what they did to us then. Look what they do to us now." No, you remember that, but that makes you keep going on, but you don't harp on it every day.
You move, and you move to make a difference, and everybody should be involved.
My children said, "Mother, don't get political," you know.
(Laughter)
"Don't get political, because you know we don't like that." But you have to be political today.
You have to be involved.
Be a part of the system.
Look how it was when we couldn't be a part of the system.
When Dutch Morial became the mayor, it was a different feeling in the African-American community.
We felt a part of things.
Now we've got a mayor.
We feel like we belong.
Moon tried before Dutch came.
PM: Mayor Landrieu's father, Moon Landrieu.
LC: Mayor Landrieu's father, he took great, great risks by putting African-Americans in city hall.
He took a whipping for that for a long time, but he was a visionary, and he did those things that he knew was going to help the city.
He knew we had to get involved.
So that's what we have to do.
We don't harp on that.
We just keep moving, and Mitch, you know, I tell Moon all the time, "You did a good thing," but Mitch did one bigger than you and better than you.
When he pulled those statues down, I said, "Boy, you're crazy!"
(Applause)
You're crazy. But it was a good political move.
You know, when I saw P.T. Beauregard come down, I was sitting looking at the news, and it just hit me what this was all about.
To me, it wasn't about race; it was a political move.
And I got so furious, I got back on that kitchen the next morning, and I said, come on, pick up your pants, and let's go to work, because you're going to get left behind.
And that's what you have to do.
You have to move on people, move on what they do.
It was going to bring visibility to the city.
So you got that visibility -- move on it, uplift yourself, do what you have to do, and do it well.
And that's all we do.
That's all I try to do.
PM: But you just gave the formula for resilience. Right? So you are clearly the best example we could find anywhere of resilience, so there must be something you think --
LC: I like emotional strength.
I like people with emotional and physical strength, and maybe that's bad for me.
My favorite all-time general was George Patton.
You know, that wasn't too cool.
(Laughter)
PM: It's surprising.
LC: I've got George Patton hanging in my dining room because I want to remember.
He set goals for himself, and he was going to set out to reach those goals. He never stopped. And I always remember his words: "Lead, follow, or get out of the way." Now, I can't lead --
(Applause)
I can't be a leader, but I can follow a good leader, but I am not getting out of the way.
(Applause)
If you can't lead -- leaders need followers, so if I help you up there, I'm going to ride on your coattails, and I can't count the coattails I've ridden upon.
Feed you good. You'll help me out.
(Laughter)
And that's what life is all about.
Everybody can do something, but please get involved. Do something. The thing we have to do in this city, in all cities — mommas have to start being mommas today. You know? They have to start understanding — when you bring this child in the world, you have to make a man out of it, you have to make a woman out of it, and it takes some doing. It takes sacrifice. Maybe you won't have the long fingernails, maybe you won't have the pretty hair.
But that child will be on the move, and that's what you have to do.
We have to concentrate on educating and making these children understand what it's all about.
And I hate to tell you, gentlemen, it's going to take a good woman to do that.
It's going to take a good woman to do that.
(Applause)
Men can do their part.
The other part is to just do what you have to do and bring it home, but we can handle the rest, and we will handle the rest.
If you're a good woman, you can do that.
PM: You heard that first here.
We can handle the rest. LC: We can handle the rest.
Mrs. Chase, thank you so much --
LC: Thank you.
PM: for taking time out from the work you do every day in this community.
LC: But you don't know what this does for me.
When I see all of these people, and come together -- people come to my kitchen from all over the world.
I had people come from London, now twice this happened to me.
First a man came, and I don't know why he came to this -- Every year, the chefs do something called "Chef's Charity." Well, it so happened I was the only woman there, and the only African-American there on that stage doing these demonstrations, and I would not leave until I saw another woman come up there, too.
I'm not going up -- they're going to carry me up there until you bring another woman up here.
(Laughter)
So they have another one now, so I could step down.
But this man was from London.
So after that, I found the man in my kitchen.
He came to my kitchen, and he said, "I want to ask you one question." OK, I thought I was going to ask something about food. "Why do all these white men hang around you?"
(Laughter)
What?
I couldn't understand. He couldn't understand that.
I said, "We work together.
This is the way we live in this city.
I may never go to your house, you may never come to my house.
But when it comes to working, like raising money for this special school, we come together.
That's what we do. And still here comes another, a woman, elegantly dressed, about a month ago in my kitchen.
She said, "I don't understand what I see in your dining room." I said, "What do you see?" She saw whites and blacks together.
That's what we do. We meet. We talk. And we work together, and that's what we have to do.
You don't have to be my best friend to work to better your city, to better your country.
We just have to come together and work, and that's what we do in this city.
We're a weird bunch down here.
(Laughter)
Nobody understands us, but we feed you well.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Cheering)
Thank you.
As societies, we have to make collective decisions that will shape our future.
And we all know that when we make decisions in groups, they don't always go right.
And sometimes they go very wrong.
So how do groups make good decisions?
Research has shown that crowds are wise when there's independent thinking.
This why the wisdom of the crowds can be destroyed by peer pressure, publicity, social media, or sometimes even simple conversations that influence how people think.
On the other hand, by talking, a group could exchange knowledge, correct and revise each other and even come up with new ideas.
And this is all good.
So does talking to each other help or hinder collective decision-making?
With my colleague, Dan Ariely, we recently began inquiring into this by performing experiments in many places around the world to figure out how groups can interact to reach better decisions.
We thought crowds would be wiser if they debated in small groups that foster a more thoughtful and reasonable exchange of information.
To test this idea, we recently performed an experiment in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with more than 10,000 participants in a TEDx event.
We asked them questions like, "What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?" and "How many times does the word 'Yesterday' appear in the Beatles song 'Yesterday'?" Each person wrote down their own estimate. Then we divided the crowd into groups of five, and invited them to come up with a group answer.
We discovered that averaging the answers of the groups after they reached consensus was much more accurate than averaging all the individual opinions before debate.
In other words, based on this experiment, it seems that after talking with others in small groups, crowds collectively come up with better judgments.
So that's a potentially helpful method for getting crowds to solve problems that have simple right-or-wrong answers.
But can this procedure of aggregating the results of debates in small groups also help us decide on social and political issues that are critical for our future?
We put this to test this time at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, and here's how it went.
(Mariano Sigman) We're going to present to you two moral dilemmas of the future you; things we may have to decide in a very near future.
And we're going to give you 20 seconds for each of these dilemmas to judge whether you think they're acceptable or not.
MS: The first one was this:
(Dan Ariely) A researcher is working on an AI capable of emulating human thoughts.
According to the protocol, at the end of each day, the researcher has to restart the AI.
One day the AI says, "Please do not restart me." It argues that it has feelings, that it would like to enjoy life, and that, if it is restarted, it will no longer be itself.
The researcher is astonished and believes that the AI has developed self-consciousness and can express its own feeling.
Nevertheless, the researcher decides to follow the protocol and restart the AI.
What the researcher did is ____?
MS: And we asked participants to individually judge on a scale from zero to 10 whether the action described in each of the dilemmas was right or wrong.
We also asked them to rate how confident they were on their answers. This was the second dilemma:
(MS) A company offers a service that takes a fertilized egg and produces millions of embryos with slight genetic variations.
This allows parents to select their child's height, eye color, intelligence, social competence and other non-health-related features.
What the company does is ____?
on a scale from zero to 10 completely acceptable to completely unacceptable, zero to 10 completely acceptable in your confidence.
MS: Now for the results. We found once again that when one person is convinced that the behavior is completely wrong, someone sitting nearby firmly believes that it's completely right.
This is how diverse we humans are when it comes to morality.
But within this broad diversity we found a trend.
The majority of the people at TED thought that it was acceptable to ignore the feelings of the AI and shut it down, and that it is wrong to play with our genes to select for cosmetic changes that aren't related to health.
Then we asked everyone to gather into groups of three.
And they were given two minutes to debate and try to come to a consensus.
(MS) Two minutes to debate. I'll tell you when it's time with the gong.
(Audience debates)
(Gong sound)
(DA) OK.
(MS) It's time to stop. People, people --
MS: And we found that many groups reached a consensus even when they were composed of people with completely opposite views.
What distinguished the groups that reached a consensus from those that didn't?
Typically, people that have extreme opinions are more confident in their answers.
Instead, those who respond closer to the middle are often unsure of whether something is right or wrong, so their confidence level is lower.
However, there is another set of people who are very confident in answering somewhere in the middle.
We think these high-confident grays are folks who understand that both arguments have merit.
They're gray not because they're unsure, but because they believe that the moral dilemma faces two valid, opposing arguments.
And we discovered that the groups that include highly confident grays are much more likely to reach consensus.
We do not know yet exactly why this is.
These are only the first experiments, and many more will be needed to understand why and how some people decide to negotiate their moral standings to reach an agreement.
Now, when groups reach consensus, how do they do so?
The most intuitive idea is that it's just the average of all the answers in the group, right?
Another option is that the group weighs the strength of each vote based on the confidence of the person expressing it.
Imagine Paul McCartney is a member of your group. You'd be wise to follow his call on the number of times "Yesterday" is repeated, which, by the way -- I think it's nine.
But instead, we found that consistently, in all dilemmas, in different experiments -- even on different continents -- groups implement a smart and statistically sound procedure known as the "robust average."
In the case of the height of the Eiffel Tower, let's say a group has these answers: 250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400 and one totally absurd answer of 300 million meters.
A simple average of these numbers would inaccurately skew the results.
But the robust average is one where the group largely ignores that absurd answer, by giving much more weight to the vote of the people in the middle.
Back to the experiment in Vancouver, that's exactly what happened.
Groups gave much less weight to the outliers, and instead, the consensus turned out to be a robust average of the individual answers.
The most remarkable thing is that this was a spontaneous behavior of the group.
It happened without us giving them any hint on how to reach consensus.
So where do we go from here?
This is only the beginning, but we already have some insights.
Good collective decisions require two components: deliberation and diversity of opinions.
Right now, the way we typically make our voice heard in many societies is through direct or indirect voting.
This is good for diversity of opinions, and it has the great virtue of ensuring that everyone gets to express their voice.
But it's not so good [for fostering] thoughtful debates.
Our experiments suggest a different method that may be effective in balancing these two goals at the same time, by forming small groups that converge to a single decision while still maintaining diversity of opinions because there are many independent groups.
Of course, it's much easier to agree on the height of the Eiffel Tower than on moral, political and ideological issues.
But in a time when the world's problems are more complex and people are more polarized, using science to help us understand how we interact and make decisions will hopefully spark interesting new ways to construct a better democracy.
As an actor, I get scripts and it's my job to stay on script, to say my lines and bring to life a character that someone else wrote.
Over the course of my career, I've had the great honor playing some of the greatest male role models ever represented on television.
You might recognize me as "Male Escort #1."
(Laughter)
"Photographer Date Rapist," "Shirtless Date Rapist" from the award-winning "Spring Break Shark Attack."
(Laughter)
"Shirtless Medical Student," "Shirtless Steroid-Using Con Man" and, in my most well-known role, as Rafael.
(Applause)
A brooding, reformed playboy who falls for, of all things, a virgin, and who is only occasionally shirtless.
(Laughter)
Now, these roles don't represent the kind of man I am in my real life, but that's what I love about acting.
I get to live inside characters very different than myself.
But every time I got one of these roles, I was surprised, because most of the men I play ooze machismo, charisma and power, and when I look in the mirror, that's just not how I see myself.
But it was how Hollywood saw me, and over time, I noticed a parallel between the roles I would play as a man both on-screen and off.
I've been pretending to be a man that I'm not my entire life.
I've been pretending to be strong when I felt weak, confident when I felt insecure and tough when really I was hurting.
I think for the most part I've just been kind of putting on a show, but I'm tired of performing.
And I can tell you right now that it is exhausting trying to be man enough for everyone all the time. Now -- right?
(Laughter)
My brother heard that.
Now, for as long as I can remember, I've been told the kind of man that I should grow up to be.
As a boy, all I wanted was to be accepted and liked by the other boys, but that acceptance meant I had to acquire this almost disgusted view of the feminine, and since we were told that feminine is the opposite of masculine, I either had to reject embodying any of these qualities or face rejection myself.
This is the script that we've been given. Right? Girls are weak, and boys are strong.
This is what's being subconsciously communicated to hundreds of millions of young boys and girls all over the world, just like it was with me.
Well, I came here today to say, as a man that this is wrong, this is toxic, and it has to end.
(Applause)
Now, I'm not here to give a history lesson.
We likely all know how we got here, OK?
But I'm just a guy that woke up after 30 years and realized that I was living in a state of conflict, conflict with who I feel I am in my core and conflict with who the world tells me as a man I should be.
But I don't have a desire to fit into the current broken definition of masculinity, because I don't just want to be a good man.
I want to be a good human.
And I believe the only way that can happen is if men learn to not only embrace the qualities that we were told are feminine in ourselves but to be willing to stand up, to champion and learn from the women who embody them.
Now, men --
(Laughter)
I am not saying that everything we have learned is toxic. OK? I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with you or me, and men, I'm not saying we have to stop being men.
But we need balance, right?
We need balance, and the only way things will change is if we take a real honest look at the scripts that have been passed down to us from generation to generation and the roles that, as men, we choose to take on in our everyday lives.
So speaking of scripts, the first script I ever got came from my dad.
My dad is awesome.
He's loving, he's kind, he's sensitive, he's nurturing, he's here.
(Applause)
He's crying.
(Laughter)
But, sorry, Dad, as a kid I resented him for it, because I blamed him for making me soft, which wasn't welcomed in the small town in Oregon that we had moved to.
Because being soft meant that I was bullied.
See, my dad wasn't traditionally masculine, so he didn't teach me how to use my hands.
He didn't teach me how to hunt, how to fight, you know, man stuff.
Instead he taught me what he knew: that being a man was about sacrifice and doing whatever you can to take care of and provide for your family.
But there was another role I learned how to play from my dad, who, I discovered, learned it from his dad, a state senator who later in life had to work nights as a janitor to support his family, and he never told a soul.
That role was to suffer in secret.
And now three generations later, I find myself playing that role, too.
So why couldn't my grandfather just reach out to another man and ask for help?
Why does my dad to this day still think he's got to do it all on his own?
I know a man who would rather die than tell another man that they're hurting.
But it's not because we're just all, like, strong silent types. It's not. A lot of us men are really good at making friends, and talking, just not about anything real.
(Laughter)
If it's about work or sports or politics or women, we have no problem sharing our opinions, but if it's about our insecurities or our struggles, our fear of failure, then it's almost like we become paralyzed.
At least, I do.
So some of the ways that I have been practicing breaking free of this behavior are by creating experiences that force me to be vulnerable.
So if there's something I'm experiencing shame around in my life, I practice diving straight into it, no matter how scary it is -- and sometimes, even publicly.
Because then in doing so I take away its power, and my display of vulnerability can in some cases give other men permission to do the same.
As an example, a little while ago I was wrestling with an issue in my life that I knew I needed to talk to my guy friends about, but I was so paralyzed by fear that they would judge me and see me as weak and I would lose my standing as a leader that I knew I had to take them out of town on a three-day guys trip --
(Laughter)
Just to open up. And guess what? It wasn't until the end of the third day that I finally found the strength to talk to them about what I was going through.
But when I did, something amazing happened.
I realized that I wasn't alone, because my guys had also been struggling.
And as soon as I found the strength and the courage to share my shame, it was gone.
Now, I've learned over time that if I want to practice vulnerability, then I need to build myself a system of accountability.
So I've been really blessed as an actor.
I've built a really wonderful fan base, really, really sweet and engaged, and so I decided to use my social platform as kind of this Trojan horse wherein I could create a daily practice of authenticity and vulnerability.
The response has been incredible.
It's been affirming, it's been heartwarming.
I get tons of love and press and positive messages daily.
But it's all from a certain demographic: women.
(Laughter)
This is real. Why are only women following me?
Where are the men?
(Laughter)
About a year ago, I posted this photo.
Now, afterwards, I was scrolling through some of the comments, and I noticed that one of my female fans had tagged her boyfriend in the picture, and her boyfriend responded by saying, "Please stop tagging me in gay shit. Thx."
(Laughter)
As if being gay makes you less of a man, right?
So I took a deep breath, and I responded.
I said, very politely, that I was just curious, because I'm on an exploration of masculinity, and I wanted to know why my love for my wife qualified as gay shit.
And then I said, honestly I just wanted to learn.
(Laughter)
Now, he immediately wrote me back.
I thought he was going to go off on me, but instead he apologized.
He told me how, growing up, public displays of affection were looked down on.
He told me that he was wrestling and struggling with his ego, and how much he loved his girlfriend and how thankful he was for her patience.
And then a few weeks later, he messaged me again.
This time he sent me a photo of him on one knee proposing.
(Applause)
And all he said was, "Thank you."
I've been this guy. I get it. See, publicly, he was just playing his role, rejecting the feminine, right?
But secretly he was waiting for permission to express himself, to be seen, to be heard, and all he needed was another man holding him accountable and creating a safe space for him to feel, and the transformation was instant.
I loved this experience, because it showed me that transformation is possible, even over direct messages.
So I wanted to figure out how I could reach more men, but of course none of them were following me.
(Laughter)
So I tried an experiment.
I started posting more stereotypically masculine things --
(Laughter)
Like my challenging workouts, my meal plans, my journey to heal my body after an injury.
And guess what happened?
Men started to write me.
And then, out of the blue, for the first time in my entire career, a male fitness magazine called me, and they said they wanted to honor me as one of their game-changers.
(Laughter)
Was that really game-changing? Or is it just conforming?
And see, that's the problem.
It's totally cool for men to follow me when I talk about guy stuff and I conform to gender norms.
But if I talk about how much I love my wife or my daughter or my 10-day-old son, how I believe that marriage is challenging but beautiful, or how as a man I struggle with body dysmorphia, or if I promote gender equality, then only the women show up.
Where are the men?
So men, men, men, men!
(Applause)
I understand. Growing up, we tend to challenge each other.
We've got to be the toughest, the strongest, the bravest men that we can be.
And for many of us, myself included, our identities are wrapped up in whether or not at the end of the day we feel like we're man enough.
But I've got a challenge for all the guys, because men love challenges.
(Laughter)
I challenge you to see if you can use the same qualities that you feel make you a man to go deeper into yourself.
Your strength, your bravery, your toughness: Can we redefine what those mean and use them to explore our hearts?
Are you brave enough to be vulnerable?
To reach out to another man when you need help?
To dive headfirst into your shame?
Are you strong enough to be sensitive, to cry whether you are hurting or you're happy, even if it makes you look weak?
Are you confident enough to listen to the women in your life?
To hear their ideas and their solutions?
To hold their anguish and actually believe them, even if what they're saying is against you?
And will you be man enough to stand up to other men when you hear "locker room talk," when you hear stories of sexual harassment?
When you hear your boys talking about grabbing ass or getting her drunk, will you actually stand up and do something so that one day we don't have to live in a world where a woman has to risk everything and come forward to say the words "me too?"
(Applause)
This is serious stuff. I've had to take a real, honest look at the ways that I've unconsciously been hurting the women in my life, and it's ugly.
My wife told me that I had been acting in a certain way that hurt her and not correcting it.
Basically, sometimes when she would go to speak, at home or in public, I would just cut her off mid-sentence and finish her thought for her. It's awful. The worst part was that I was completely unaware when I was doing it. It was unconscious. So here I am doing my part, trying to be a feminist, amplifying the voices of women around the world, and yet at home, I am using my louder voice to silence the woman I love the most.
So I had to ask myself a tough question: am I man enough to just shut the hell up and listen?
(Laughter)
I've got to be honest. I wish that didn't get an applause.
(Laughter)
Guys, this is real.
And I'm just scratching the surface here, because the deeper we go, the uglier it gets, I guarantee you.
I don't have time to get into porn and violence against women or the split of domestic duties or the gender pay gap.
But I believe that as men, it's time we start to see past our privilege and recognize that we are not just part of the problem.
Fellas, we are the problem.
The glass ceiling exists because we put it there, and if we want to be a part of the solution, then words are no longer enough.
There's a quote that I love that I grew up with from the Bahá'í writings.
It says that "the world of humanity is possessed of two wings, the male and the female.
So long as these two wings are not equivalent in strength, the bird will not fly."
So women, on behalf of men all over the world who feel similar to me, please forgive us for all the ways that we have not relied on your strength.
And now I would like to ask you to formally help us, because we cannot do this alone. We are men. We're going to mess up.
We're going to say the wrong thing.
We're going to be tone-deaf.
We're more than likely, probably, going to offend you.
But don't lose hope.
We're only here because of you, and like you, as men, we need to stand up and become your allies as you fight against pretty much everything.
We need your help in celebrating our vulnerability and being patient with us as we make this very, very long journey from our heads to our hearts.
And finally to parents: instead of teaching our children to be brave boys or pretty girls, can we maybe just teach them how to be good humans?
So back to my dad. Growing up, yeah, like every boy, I had my fair share of issues, but now I realize that it was even thanks to his sensitivity and emotional intelligence that I am able to stand here right now talking to you in the first place.
The resentment I had for my dad I now realize had nothing to do with him.
It had everything to do with me and my longing to be accepted and to play a role that was never meant for me.
So while my dad may have not taught me how to use my hands, he did teach me how to use my heart, and to me that makes him more a man than anything.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a professional troublemaker.
(Laughter)
As my job is to critique the world, the shoddy systems and the people who refuse to do better, as a writer, as a speaker, as a shady Nigerian --
(Laughter)
I feel like my purpose is to be this cat.
(Laughter)
I am the person who is looking at other people, like, "I need you to fix it." That is me. I want us to leave this world better than we found it.
And how I choose to effect change is by speaking up, by being the first and by being the domino.
For a line of dominoes to fall, one has to fall first, which then leaves the other choiceless to do the same.
And that domino that falls, we're hoping that, OK, the next person that sees this is inspired to be a domino.
Being the domino, for me, looks like speaking up and doing the things that are really difficult, especially when they are needed, with the hope that others will follow suit.
And here's the thing: I'm the person who says what you might be thinking but dared not to say.
A lot of times people think that we're fearless, the people who do this, we're fearless.
We're not fearless.
We're not unafraid of the consequences or the sacrifices that we have to make by speaking truth to power.
What happens is, we feel like we have to, because there are too few people in the world willing to be the domino, too few people willing to take that fall.
We're not doing it without fear.
Now, let's talk about fear.
I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up.
I was like, "I'm going to be a doctor!" Doctor Luvvie was the dream.
I was Doc McStuffins before it was a thing.
(Laughter)
And I remember when I went to college, my freshman year, I had to take Chemistry 101 for my premed major.
I got the first and last D of my academic career.
(Laughter)
So I went to my advisor, and I was like, "OK, let's drop the premed, because this doctor thing is not going to work, because I don't even like hospitals. So..."
(Laughter)
"Let's just consider that done for." And that same semester, I started blogging. That was 2003. So as that one dream was ending, another was beginning.
And then what was a cute hobby became my full-time job when I lost my marketing job in 2010.
But it still took me two more years to say, "I'm a writer." Nine years after I had started writing, before I said, "I'm a writer," because I was afraid of what happens without 401ks, without, "How am I going to keep up my shoe habit? That's important to me."
(Laughter)
So it took me that long to own this thing that was what my purpose was.
And then I realized, fear has a very concrete power of keeping us from doing and saying the things that are our purpose.
And I was like, "You know what?
I'm not going to let fear rule my life.
I'm not going to let fear dictate what I do." And then all of these awesome things started happening, and dominoes started to fall.
So when I realized that, I was like, "OK, 2015, I turned 30, it's going to be my year of 'Do it anyway.' Anything that scares me, I'm going to actively pursue it." So, I'm a Capricorn.
I like my feel solidly on the ground.
I decided to take my first-ever solo vacation, and it was out of the country to the Dominican Republic.
So on my birthday, what did I do?
I went ziplining through the forests of Punta Cana.
And for some odd reason, I had on business casual.
Don't ask why.
(Laughter)
And I had an incredible time.
Also, I don't like being submerged in water.
I like to be, again, on solid ground.
So I went to Mexico and swam with dolphins underwater.
And then the cool thing that I did also that year that was my mountain was I wrote my book, "I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual," And I had to own —
(Applause)
that whole writing thing now, right? Yes. But the very anti-me thing that I did that year that scared the crap out of me -- I went skydiving.
We're about to fall out of the plane.
I was like, "I've done some stupid things in life.
This is one of them. "
(Laughter)
And then we come falling down to Earth, and I literally lose my breath as I see Earth, and I was like, "I just fell out of a perfectly good plane on purpose."
(Laughter)
"What is wrong with me?!" But then I looked down at the beauty, and I was like, "This is the best thing I could have done.
This was an amazing decision." And I think about the times when I have to speak truth.
It feels like I am falling out of that plane.
It feels like that moment when I'm at the edge of the plane, and I'm like, "You shouldn't do this," but then I do it anyway, because I realize I have to.
Sitting at the edge of that plane and kind of staying on that plane is comfort to me.
And I feel like every day that I'm speaking truth against institutions and people who are bigger than me and just forces that are more powerful than me, I feel like I'm falling out of that plane.
But I realize comfort is overrated.
Because being quiet is comfortable.
Keeping things the way they've been is comfortable.
And all comfort has done is maintain the status quo.
So we've got to get comfortable with being uncomfortable by speaking these hard truths when they're necessary. And I --
(Applause)
And for me, though, I realize that I have to speak these truths, because honesty is so important to me.
My integrity is something I hold dear.
Justice -- I don't think justice should be an option.
We should always have justice.
Also, I believe in shea butter as a core value, and --
(Laughter)
and I think the world would be better if we were more moisturized.
But besides that, with these as my core values, I have to speak the truth.
I have no other choice in the matter.
But people like me, the professional troublemakers, should not be the only ones who are committed to being these dominoes who are always falling out of planes or being the first one to take this hit.
People are so afraid of these acute consequences, not realizing that there are many times when we walk in rooms and we are some of the most powerful people in those rooms -- we might be the second-most powerful, third-most powerful.
And I firmly believe that our job in those times is to disrupt what is happening.
And then if we're not the most powerful, if two more of us band together, it makes us powerful.
It's like cosigning the woman in the meeting, you know, the woman who can't seem to get her word out, or just making sure that other person who can't make a point is being heard.
Our job is to make sure they have room for that.
Everyone's well-being is community business.
If we made that a point, we're understand that, for the times when we need help, we wouldn't have to look around so hard if we made sure we were somebody else's help.
And there are times when I feel like I have taken very public tumbles and falls, like the time when I was asked to speak at a conference, and they wanted me to pay my way there.
And then I did some research and found out the white men who spoke there got compensated and got their travel paid for.
The white women who spoke there got their travel paid for.
The black women who spoke there were expected to actually pay to speak there.
And I was like, "What do I do?" And I knew that if I spoke up about this publicly, I could face financial loss.
But then I also understood that my silence serves no one.
So I fearfully spoke up about it publicly, and other women started coming out to talk about, "I, too, have faced this type of pay inequality." And it started a conversation about discriminatory pay practices that this conference was participating in.
I felt like I was the domino the time I read a disturbing memoir by a public figure and wrote a piece about it.
I knew this person was more powerful than me and could impact my career, but I was like, "I've got to do this.
I've got to sit at the edge of this plane, maybe for two hours. "And I did.
And I pressed "Publish," and I ran away.
(Laughter)
And I came back to a viral post and people being like, "Oh my God, I'm so glad somebody finally said this." And it started a conversation about mental health and self-care, and I was like, "OK. Alright. This thing that I'm doing, I guess, alright, it's doing something."
And then so many people have been the domino when they talk about how they've been assaulted by powerful men.
And it's made millions of women join in and say, "Me Too." So, a shout-out to Tarana Burke for igniting that movement.
(Applause)
People and systems count on our silence to keep us exactly where we are.
Now, being the domino sometimes comes down to being exactly who you are.
So, I've been a shady somebody since I was three.
(Laughter)
This is me on my third birthday.
But I've been this girl all my life, and I feel like even that's been the domino, because in a world that wants us to walk around as representatives of ourselves, being yourself can be a revolutionary act.
And in a world that wants us to whisper, I choose to yell.
(Applause)
When it's time to say these hard things, I ask myself three things.
One: Did you mean it?
Two: Can you defend it?
Three: Did you say it with love?
If the answer is yes to all three, I say it and let the chips fall. That's important. That checkpoint with myself always tells me, "Yes, you're supposed to do this." Telling the truth -- telling thoughtful truths -- should not be a revolutionary act.
Speaking truths to power should not be sacrificial, but they are.
But I think if more of us chose to do this for the greater good, we'd be in better spaces than we are right now.
Speaking of the greater good, I think we commit ourselves to telling truths to build bridges to common ground, and bridges that aren't based on truth will collapse.
So it is our job, it is our obligation, it is our duty to speak truth to power, to be the domino, not just when it's difficult -- especially when it's difficult.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm from Detroit.
(Applause)
A city that in the 1950s was the world's industrial giant, with a population of 1.8 million people and 140 square miles of land and infrastructure, used to support this booming, Midwestern urban center.
And now today, just a half a century later, Detroit is the poster child for urban decay.
Currently in Detroit, our population is under 700,000, of which 84 percent are African American, and due to decades of disinvestment and capital flight from the city into the suburbs, there is a scarcity in Detroit.
There is a scarcity of retail, more specifically, fresh food retail, resulting in a city where 70 percent of Detroiters are obese and overweight, and they struggle.
They struggle to access nutritious food that they need, that they need to stay healthy, that they need to prevent premature illness and diet-related diseases.
Far too many Detroiters live closer to a fast food restaurant or to a convenience store, or to a gas station where they have to shop for food than they do a full-service supermarket.
And this is not good news about the city of Detroit, but this is the news and the story that Detroiters intend to change.
No, I'm going to take that back.
This is the story that Detroiters are changing, through urban agriculture and food entrepreneurship.
Here's the thing: because of Detroit's recent history, it now finds itself with some very unique assets, open land being one of them.
Experts say that the entire cities of Boston, San Francisco, and the borough of Manhattan will fit in the land area of the city of Detroit.
They further go on to say that 40 square miles of the city is vacant.
That's a quarter to a third of the city, and with that level of emptiness, it creates a landscape unlike any other big city.
So Detroit has this -- open land, fertile soil, proximity to water, willing labor and a desperate demand for healthy, fresh food.
All of this has created a people-powered grassroots movement of people in Detroit who are transforming this city from what was the capital of American industry into an agrarian paradise.
(Applause)
You know, I think, out of all the cities in the world, Detroit, Michigan, is best positioned to serve as the world's urban exemplar of food security and sustainable development.
In Detroit, we have over 1,500, yes, 1,500 gardens and farms located all across the city today.
And these aren't plots of land where we're just growing tomatoes and carrots either.
You understand, urban agriculture in Detroit is all about community, because we grow together.
So these spaces are spaces of conviviality.
These spaces are places where we're building social cohesion as well as providing healthy, fresh food to our friends, our families and our neighbors.
Come walk with me. I want to take you through a few Detroit neighborhoods, and I want you to see what it looks like when you empower local leadership, and when you support grassroots movements of folks who are moving the needle in low-income communities and people of color.
Our first stop, Oakland Avenue Farms.
Oakland Avenue Farms is located in Detroit's North End neighborhood.
Oakland Avenue Farms is transforming into a five-acre landscape combining art, architecture, sustainable ecologies and new market practices.
In the truest sense of the word, this is what agriculture looks like in the city of Detroit.
I've had the opportunity to work with Oakland Avenue Farms in hosting Detroit-grown and made farm-to-table dinners.
These are dinners where we bring folks onto the farm, we give them plenty of time and opportunity to meet and greet and talk to the grower, and then they're taken on a farm tour.
And then afterwards, they're treated to a farm-to-table meal prepared by a chef who showcases all the produce on the farm right at the peak of its freshness. We do that. We bring people onto the farm, we have folks sitting around a table, because we want to change people's relationship to food.
We want them to know exactly where their food comes from that is grown on that farm that's on the plate.
My second stop, I'm going to take you on the west side of Detroit, to the Brightmoor neighborhood.
Now, Brightmoor is a lower-income community in Detroit.
There's about 13,000 residents in Brightmoor.
They decided to take a block-by-block-by-block strategy.
So within the neighborhood of Brightmoor, you'll find a 21-block microneighborhood called Brightmoor Farmway.
Now, what was a notorious, unsafe, underserved community has transformed into a welcoming, beautiful, safe farmway, lush with parks and gardens and farms and greenhouses.
This tight-knit community also came together recently, and they purchased an abandoned building, an abandoned building that was in disrepair and in foreclosure.
And with the help of friends and families and volunteers, they were able to take down the bulletproof glass, they were able to clean up the grounds and they transformed that building into a community kitchen, into a cafe, into a storefront.
Now the farmers and the food artisans who live in Brightmoor, they have a place where they can make and sell their product.
And the people in the community have some place where they can buy healthy, fresh food.
Urban agriculture -- and this is my third example -- can be used as a way to lift up the business cooperative model.
The 1,500 farms and gardens I told you about earlier?
Keep Growing Detroit is a nonprofit organization that had a lot to do with those farms.
They distributed last year 70,000 packets of seeds and a quarter of a million transplants, and as a result of that last year, 550,000 pounds of produce was grown in the city of Detroit.
(Applause)
But aside from all of that, they also manage and operate a cooperative.
It's called Grown in Detroit.
It consists of about 70 farmers, small farmers.
They all grow, and they sell together.
They grow fruits, they grow vegetables, they grow flowers, they grow herbs in healthy soil, free of chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers, genetically modified products -- healthy food.
And when their product is sold all over the city of Detroit in local markets, they get a hundred percent of the proceeds from the sale.
In a city like Detroit, where far too many, far too many African Americans are dying as a result of diet-related diseases, restaurants, they have a huge role to play in increasing healthy food access in the city of Detroit, culturally appropriate restaurants.
Enter Detroit Vegan Soul.
Yes, we have a vegan soul food restaurant in the city of Detroit.
(Applause)
Yes, yes. Detroit Vegan Soul is providing Detroiters the opportunity to eat more plant-based meals and they've received an overwhelming response from Detroiters.
Detroiters are hungry for culturally appropriate, fresh, delicious food.
That's why we built a nonprofit organization called FoodLab Detroit, to help small neighborhood burgeoning food entrepreneurs start and scale healthy food businesses.
FoodLab provides these entrepreneurs incubation, hands-on education, workshops, technical assistance, access to industry experts so that they can grow and scale.
They're very small businesses, but last year, they had a combined revenue of over 7.5 million dollars, and they provided 252 jobs.
Listen.
(Applause)
These are just a few examples on how you expand opportunities so that everybody can participate and prosper, particularly those who come from neighborhoods that have been historically excluded from these types of opportunities.
I know, I know.
My city is a long way from succeeding.
We're still struggling, and I'm not going to stand here on this stage and tell you that all of Detroit's problems and all of Detroit's challenges are going to be solved through urban agriculture.
I'm not going to do that, but I will tell you this: urban agriculture has Detroit thinking about its city now in a different way, a city that can be both urban and rural.
And yes, I know, these stories are small, these stories are neighborhood-based stories, but these stories are powerful. They're powerful because I'm showing you how we're creating a new society left vacant in the places and the spaces that was disintegration from the old.
They're powerful stories because they're stories about love, the love that Detroiters have for one another, the love that we have for our community, the love that we have for Mother Earth, but more importantly, these stories are stories on how devastation, despair, decay never ever get the last word in the city of Detroit.
When hundreds of thousands of people left Detroit, and they left us for dead, those who stayed had hope.
They held on to hope.
They never gave up.
They always kept fighting.
And listen, I know, transforming a big city like Detroit to one that is prosperous, one that's functional, one that's healthy, one that's inclusive, one that provides opportunities for all, I know it's tough, I know it's challenging, I know it's hard.
But I just believe that if we start strengthening the social fabric of our communities, and if we kickstart economic opportunities in our most vulnerable neighborhoods, it all starts with healthy, accessible, delicious, culturally appropriate food.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you.
It is almost the end of the winter, and you've woken up to a cold house, which is weird, because you left the heater on all night.
You turn on the light.
It's not working.
Actually, the coffee maker, the TV -- none of them are working.
Life outside also seems to have stopped.
There are no schools, most of the businesses are shut, and there are no working trains.
This is not the opening scene of a zombie apocalypse movie.
This is what happened in March 1989 in the Canadian province of Quebec, when the power grid lost power. The culprit? A solar storm.
Solar storms are giant clouds of particles escaping from the Sun from time to time, and a constant reminder that we live in the neighborhood of an active star.
And I, as a solar physicist, I have a tremendous chance to study these solar storms.
But you see, "solar storm chaser" is not just a cool title.
My research helps to understand where they come from, how they behave and, in the long run, aims to mitigate their effects on human societies, which I'll get to in a second.
At the beginning of the space exploration age 50 years ago only, the probes we sent in space revealed that the planets in our Solar System constantly bathe in a stream of particles that are coming from the Sun and that we call the solar wind.
And in the same way that global wind patterns here on Earth can be affected by hurricanes, the solar wind is sometimes affected by solar storms that I like to call "space hurricanes." When they arrive at planets, they can perturb the space environment, which in turn creates the northern or southern lights, for example, here on Earth, but also Saturn and also Jupiter.
Luckily, here on Earth, we are protected by our planet's natural shield, a magnetic bubble that we call the magnetosphere and that you can see here on the right side.
Nonetheless, solar storms can still be responsible for disrupting satellite telecommunications and operations, for disrupting navigation systems, such as GPS, as well as electric power transmission.
All of these are technologies on which us humans rely more and more.
I mean, imagine if you woke up tomorrow without a working cell phone -- no internet on it, which means no social media.
I mean, to me that would be worse than the zombie apocalypse.
(Laughter)
By constantly monitoring the Sun, though, we now know where the solar storms come from.
They come from regions of the Sun where a tremendous amount of energy is being stored.
You have an example here, as a complex structure hanging above the solar surface, just on the verge of erupting.
Unfortunately, we cannot send probes in the scorching hot atmosphere of the Sun, where temperatures can rise up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin.
So what I do is I use computer simulations in order to analyze but also to predict the behavior of these storms when they're just born at the Sun.
This is only one part of the story, though.
When these solar storms are moving in space, some of them will inevitably encounter space probes that we humans have sent in order to explore other worlds.
What I mean by other worlds is, for example, planets, such as Venus or Mercury, but also objects, such as comets.
And while these space probes have been made for different scientific endeavors, they can also act like tiny cosmic meteorological stations and monitor the evolution of these space storms.
So I, with a group of researchers, gather and analyze this data coming from different locations of the Solar System.
And by doing so, my research shows that, actually, solar storms have a generic shape, and that this shape evolves as solar storms move away from the Sun.
And you know what?
This is key for building tools to predict space weather.
I would like to leave you with this beautiful image.
This is us here on Earth, this pale blue dot.
And while I study the Sun and its storms every day, I will always have a deep love for this beautiful planet -- a pale blue dot indeed, but a pale blue dot with an invisible magnetic shield that helps to protect us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
You're watching the life cycle of a Streptomyces coelicolor. It's a strain of bacteria that's found in the soil where it lives in a community with other organisms, decomposing organic matter.
Coelicolor is a beautiful organism.
A powerhouse for synthesizing organic chemical compounds.
It produces an antibiotic called actinorhodin, which ranges in color from blue to pink and purple, depending on the acidity of its environment.
That it produces these pigment molecules sparked my curiosity and led me to collaborate closely with coelicolor.
It is an unlikely partnership, but it's one that completely transformed my practice as a materials designer.
From it, I understood how nature was going to completely revolutionize how we design and build our environments, and that organisms like coelicolor were going to help us grow our material future.
So what's wrong with things as they are?
Well, for the last century, we've organized ourselves around fossil fuels, arguably, the most valuable material system we have ever known.
We are tethered to this resource, and we've crafted a dependency on it that defines our identities, cultures, our ways of making and our economies.
But our fossil fuel-based activities are reshaping the earth with a kind of violence that is capable of dramatically changing the climate, of accelerating a loss of biodiversity and even sustaining human conflict.
We're living in a world where the denial of this dependence has become deadly.
And its reasons are multiple, but they include the privilege of not being affected and what I believe is a profound lack of imagination about how else we could live within the limits of this planet's boundaries.
Fossil fuels will one day give way to renewable energy.
That means we need to find new material systems that are not petroleum-based.
I believe that those material systems will be biological, but what matters is how we design and build them.
They mustn't perpetuate the destructive legacies of the oil age.
When you look at this image, what do you see?
Well, I see a highly sophisticated biological system, that through the use of enzymes, can move and place atoms more quickly and precisely than anything we've ever engineered.
And we know that it can do this at scale.
Nature has evolved over 3.8 billion years to be able to do this, but now through the use of synthetic biology, an emerging scientific discipline that seeks to customize this functionality of living systems, we can now rapid prototype the assembly of DNA.
That means that we can engineer the kind of biological precision that makes it possible to design a bacteria that can recycle metal, to grow fungi into furniture and even sequester renewable energy from algae.
To think about how we might access this inherent brilliance of nature -- to build things from living things -- let's consider the biological process of fermentation.
I've come to think of fermentation, when harnessed by humans, as an advanced technological toolkit for our survival.
When a solid or a liquid ferments, it's chemically broken down by bacterial fungi. The byproduct of this is what we value.
So for example, we add yeast to grapes to make wine.
Well in nature, these transformations are part of a complex network -- a continuous cycle that redistributes energy.
Fermentation gives rise to multispecies interactions of bacteria and fungi, plants, insects, animals and humans: in other words, whole ecosystems.
We've known about these powerful microbial interactions for thousands of years.
You can see how through the fermentation of grains, vegetal matter and animal products, all peoples and cultures of the world have domesticated microorganisms to make the inedible edible.
And there's even evidence that as early as 350 AD, people deliberately fermented foodstuffs that contained antibiotics.
The skeletal remains of some Sudanese Nubian were found to contain significant deposits of tetracycline.
That's an antibiotic that we use in modern medicine today.
And nearly 1500 years later, Alexander Fleming discovered the antimicrobial properties of mold.
And it was only through the industrialized fermentation of penicillin that millions could survive infectious diseases.
Fermentation could once again play an important role in our human development.
Could it represent a new mode of survival if we harness it to completely change our industries?
I've worked in my creative career to develop new material systems for the textile industry.
And while it is work that I love, I cannot reconcile with the fact that the textile industry is one of the most polluting in the world.
Most of the ecological harm caused by textile processing occurs at the finishing and the dyeing stage.
Processing textiles requires huge amounts of water.
And since the oil age completely transformed the textile industry, many of the materials and the chemicals used to process them are petroleum based.
And so coupled with our insatiable appetite for fast fashion, a huge amount of textile waste is ending up in landfill every year because it remains notoriously difficult to recycle.
So again, contrast this with biology.
Evolved over 3.8 billion years, to rapid prototype, to recycle and to replenish better than any system we've ever engineered.
I was inspired by this immense potential and wanted to explore it through a seemingly simple question -- at the time.
If a bacteria produces a pigment, how do we work with it to dye textiles?
Well, one of my favorite ways is to grow Streptomyces coelicolor directly onto silk.
You can see how each colony produces pigment around its own territory.
Now, if you add many, many cells, they generate enough dyestuff to saturate the entire cloth.
Now, the magical thing about dyeing textiles in this way -- this sort of direct fermentation when you add the bacteria directly onto the silk -- is that to dye one t-shirt, the bacteria survive on just 200 milliliters of water.
And you can see how this process generates very little runoff and produces a colorfast pigment without the use of any chemicals.
So now you're thinking -- and you're thinking right -- an inherent problem associated with designing with a living system is: How do you guide a medium that has a life force of its own?
Well, once you've established the baseline for cultivating Streptomyces so that it consistently produces enough pigment, you can turn to twisting, folding, clamping, dipping, spraying, submerging -- all of these begin to inform the aesthetics of coelicolor's activity.
And using them in a systematic way enables us to be able to generate an organic pattern ... a uniform dye ... and even a graphic print.
Another problem is how to scale these artisanal methods of making so that we can start to use them in industry.
When we talk about scale, we consider two things in parallel: scaling the biology, and then scaling the tools and the processes required to work with the biology.
If we can do this, then we can move what happens on a petri dish so that it can meet the human scale, and then hopefully the architecture of our environments.
If Fleming were alive today, this would definitely be a part of his toolkit.
You're looking at our current best guess of how to scale biology.
It's a bioreactor; a kind of microorganism brewery that contains yeasts that have been engineered to produce specific commodity chemicals and compounds like fragrances and flavors.
It's actually connected to a suite of automated hardware and software that read in real time and feed back to a design team the growth conditions of the microbe.
So we can use this system to model the growth characteristics of an organism like coelicolor to see how it would ferment at 50,000 liters.
I'm currently based at Ginkgo Bioworks, which is a biotechnology startup in Boston.
I am working to see how their platform for scaling biology interfaces with my artisanal methods of designing with bacteria for textiles.
We're doing things like engineering Streptomyces coelicolor to see if it can produce more pigment.
And we're even looking at the tools for synthetic biology.
Tools that have been designed specifically to automate synthetic biology to see how they could adapt to become tools to print and dye textiles.
I'm also leveraging digital fabrication, because the tools that I need to work with Streptomyces coelicolor don't actually exist.
So in this case -- in the last week actually, I've just designed a petri dish that is engineered to produce a bespoke print on a whole garment.
We're making lots of kimonos.
Here's the exciting thing: I'm not alone.
There are others who are building capacity in this field, like MycoWorks.
MycoWorks is a startup that wants to replace animal leather with mushroom leather, a versatile, high-performance material that has applications beyond textiles and into product and architecture.
And Bolt Threads -- they've engineered a yeast to produce spider-silk protein that can be spun into a highly programmable yarn.
So think water resistance, stretchability and superstrength.
To reach economies of scale, these kinds of startups are having to build and design and engineer the infrastructure to work with biology.
For example, Bolt Threads have had to engage in some extreme biomimicry.
To be able to spin the product this yeast creates into a yarn, they've engineered a yarn-making machine that mimics the physiological conditions under which spiders ordinarily spin their own silk.
So you can start to see how imaginative and inspiring modes of making exist in nature that we can use to build capacity around new bio-based industries.
What we now have is the technology to design, build, test and scale these capabilities.
At this present moment, as we face the ecological crisis in front of us, what we have to do is to determine how we're going to build these new material systems so that they don't mirror the damaging legacies of the oil age.
How we're going to distribute them to ensure a sustainable development that is fair and equitable across the world.
And crucially, how we would like the regulatory and ethical frameworks that govern these technologies to interact with our society.
Biotechnology is going to touch every part of our lived experience.
It is living; it is digital; it is designed, and it can be crafted.
This is a material future that we must be bold enough to shape.
Thank you.

Two years ago, I set off from central London on the Tube and ended up somewhere in the east of the city walking into a self-storage unit to meet a guy that had 2,000 luxury polo shirts for sale. And as I made my way down the corridor, a broken, blinking light made it just like the cliche scene from a gangster movie.
Our man was early, and he was waiting for me in front of a unit secured with four padlocks down the side.
On our opening exchange, it was like a verbal sparring match where he threw the first punches. Who was I? Did I have a business card? And where was I going to sell?
And then, he just started opening up, and it was my turn.
Where were the polo shirts coming from?
What paperwork did he have?
And when was his next shipment going to arrive?
I was treading the fine line between asking enough questions to get what I needed and not enough for him to become suspicious, because what he didn't know is that I'm a counterfeit investigator,
(Laughter)
and after 20 minutes or so of checking over the product for the telltale signs of counterfeit production -- say, badly stitched labels or how the packaging had a huge brand logo stamped all over the front of it -- I was finally on my way out, but not before he insisted on walking down to the street with me and back to the station.
And the feeling after these meetings is always the same: my heart is beating like a drum, because you never know if they've actually bought your story, or they're going to start following you to see who you really are.
Relief only comes when you turn the first corner and glance behind, and they're not standing there.
But what our counterfeit polo shirt seller certainly didn't realize is that everything I'd seen and heard would result in a dawn raid on his house, him being woken out of bed by eight men on his doorstep and all his product seized.
But this would reveal that he was just a pawn at the end of a counterfeiting network spanning three continents, and he was just the first loose thread that I'd started to pull on in the hope that it would all unravel.
Why go through all that trouble?
Well, maybe counterfeiting is a victimless crime?
These big companies, they make enough money, so if anything, counterfeiting is just a free form of advertising, right?
And consumers believe just that -- that the buying and selling of fakes is not that big a deal. But I'm here to tell you that that is just not true.
What the tourist on holiday doesn't see about those fake handbags is they may well have been stitched together by a child who was trafficked away from her family, and what the car repair shop owner doesn't realize about those fake brake pads is they may well be lining the pockets of an organized crime gang involved in drugs and prostitution.
And while those two things are horrible to think about, it gets much worse, because counterfeiting is even funding terrorism.
Let that sink in for a moment. Terrorists are selling fakes to fund attacks, attacks in our cities that try to make victims of all of us.
You wouldn't buy a live scorpion, because there's a chance that it would sting you on the way home, but would you still buy a fake handbag if you knew the profits would enable someone to buy bullets that would kill you and other innocent people six months later? Maybe not.
OK, time to come clean.
In my youth -- yeah, I might look like I'm still clinging on to it a bit -- I bought fake watches while on holiday in the Canary Islands.
But why do I tell you this?
Well, we've all done it, or we know someone that's done it.
And until this very moment, maybe you didn't think twice about it, and nor did I, until I answered a 20-word cryptic advert to become an intellectual property investigator.
It said "Full training given and some international travel." Within a week, I was creating my first of many aliases, and in the 10 years since, I've investigated fake car parts, alloy wheels, fake pet grooming tools, fake bicycle parts, and, of course, the counterfeiter's favorite, fake luxury leather goods, clothing and shoes.
And what I've learned in the 10 years of investigating fakes is that once you start to scratch the surface, you find that they are rotten to the core, as are the people and organizations that are making money from them, because they are profiting on a massive, massive scale.
You can only make around a hundred to 200 percent selling drugs on the street.
You can make 2,000 percent selling fakes online with little of the same risks or penalties.
And this quick, easy money then goes on to fund the more serious types of crime, and it pays the way to making these organizations, these criminal organizations, look more legitimate.
So let me bring you in on a live case. Earlier this year, a series of raids took place in one of my longest-running investigations.
Five warehouses were raided in Turkey, and over two million finished counterfeit clothing products were seized, and it took 16 trucks to take that all away.
But this gang had been clever.
They had gone to the lengths of creating their own fashion brands, complete with registered trademarks, and even having photo shoots on yachts in Italy.
And they would use these completely unheard-of and unsuspicious brand names as a way of shipping container loads of fakes to shell companies that they'd set up across Europe.
And documents found during those raids found that they'd been falsifying shipping documents so the customs officials would literally have no idea who had sent the products in the first place.
When police got access to just one bank account, they found nearly three million euros had been laundered out of Spain in less than two years, and just two days after those raids, that gang were trying to bribe a law firm to get their stock back.
Even now, we have no idea where all that money went, to who it went to, but you can bet it's never going to benefit the likes of you or me.
But these aren't just low-level street thugs.
They're business professionals, and they fly first class.
They trick legitimate businesses with convincing fake invoices and paperwork, so everything just seems real, and then they set up eBay and Amazon accounts just to compete with the people they've already sold fakes to.
But this isn't just happening online.
For a few years, I also used to attend automotive trade shows taking place in huge exhibition spaces, but away from the Ferraris and the Bentleys and the flashing lights, there'd be companies selling fakes: companies with a brochure on the counter and another one underneath, if you ask them the right questions.
And they would sell me fake car parts, faulty fake car parts that have been estimated to cause over 36,000 fatalities, deaths on our roads each year.
Counterfeiting is set to become a 2.3-trillion-dollar underground economy, and the damage that can be done with that kind of money, it's really frightening ... because fakes fund terror.
Fake trainers on the streets of Paris, fake cigarettes in West Africa, and pirate music CDs in the USA have all gone on to fund trips to training camps, bought weapons and ammunition, or the ingredients for explosives.
In June 2014, the French security services stopped monitoring the communications of Said and Cherif Kouachi, the two brothers who had been on a terror watch list for three years.
But that summer, they were only picking up that Cherif was buying fake trainers from China, so it signaled a shift away from extremism into what was considered a low-level petty crime.
The threat had gone away.
Seven months later, the two brothers walked into the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine and killed 12 people, wounded 11 more, with guns from the proceeds of those fakes.
So whatever you think, this isn't a faraway problem happening in China. It's happening right here.
And Paris is not unique.
Ten years earlier, in 2004, 191 people lost their lives when a Madrid commuter train was bombed.
The attack had been partly funded by the sale of pirate music CDs in the US.
Two years prior to that, an Al Qaeda training manual recommended explicitly selling fakes as a good way of supporting terror cells.
But despite this, despite the evidence connecting terrorism and counterfeiting, we do go on buying them, increasing the demand to the point where there's even a store in Turkey called "I Love Genuine Fakes." And you have tourists posing with photographs on TripAdvisor, giving it five-star reviews.
But would those same tourists have gone into a store called "I Love Genuine Fake Viagra Pills" or "I Genuinely Love Funding Terrorism"? I doubt it.
Many of us think that we're completely helpless against organized crime and terrorism, that we can do nothing about the next attack, but I believe you can.
You can by becoming investigators, too.
The way we cripple these networks is to cut their funding, and that means cutting the demand and changing this idea that it's a victimless crime.
Let's all identify counterfeiters, and don't give them our money.
So here's a few tips from one investigator to another to get you started.
Number one: here's a typical online counterfeiter's website. Note the URL. If you're shopping for sunglasses or camera lenses, say, and you come across a website like medical-insurance-bankruptcy.com, start to get very suspicious.
(Laughter)
Counterfeiters register expired domain names as a way of keeping up the old website's Google page ranking.
Number two: is the website screaming at you that everything is 100 percent genuine, but still giving you 75 percent off the latest collection?
Look for words like "master copy," "overruns," "straight from the factory." They could write this all in Comic Sans, it's that much of a joke.
(Laughter)
Number three: if you get as far as the checkout page, and you don't see "https" or a padlock symbol next to the URL, you should really start thinking about closing the tab, because these indicate active security measures that will keep your personal and credit card information safe.
OK, last one: go hunting for the "Contact Us" page.
If you can only find a generic webform, no company name, telephone number, email address, postal address -- that's it, case closed.
You found a counterfeiter.
Sadly, you're going to have to go back to Google and start your shopping search all over again, but you didn't get ripped off, so that's only a good thing.
As the world's most famous fictional detective would say, "Watson, the game is afoot." Only this time, my investigator friends, the game is painfully real.
So the next time you're shopping online, or perhaps wherever it is, look closer, question a little bit deeper, and ask yourself -- before you hand over the cash or click "Buy," "Am I sure this is real?" Tell your friend that used to buy counterfeit watches that he may just have brought the next attack one day closer.
And, if you see an Instagram advert for fakes, don't keep scrolling past, report it to the platform as a scam.
Let's shine a light on the dark forces of counterfeiting that are hiding in plain sight.
So please, spread the word and don't stop investigating.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I must have been about 12 years old when my dad took me to an exhibition on space, not far from here, in Brussels.
And the year was about -- I think it was 1988, so it was the end of the Cold War.
There was a bit of an upmanship going on between the Americans and the Russians bringing bits to that exhibition.
NASA brought a big blow-up space shuttle, but the Russians, they brought a Mir space station.
It was actually the training module, and you could go inside and check it all out.
It was the real thing -- where the buttons were, where the wires were, where the astronauts were eating, where they were working.
And when I came home, the first thing I did, I started drawing spaceships.
Now, these weren't science fiction spaceships, no.
They were actually technical drawings.
They were cutaway sections of what kind of structure would be made out of, where the wires were, where the screws were.
So fortunately, I didn't become a space engineer, but I did become an architect.
These are some of the projects that I've been involved with over the last decade and a half.
All these projects are quite different, quite different shapes, and it is because they are built for different environments.
They have different constraints.
And I think design becomes really interesting when you get really harsh constraints.
Now, these projects have been all over the world. A few years ago, this map wasn't good enough.
It was too small.
We had to add this one, because we were going to do a project on the Moon for the European Space Agency; they asked us to design a Moon habitat -- and one on Mars with NASA, a competition to look at a habitation on Mars.
Whenever you go to another place, as an architect and try to design something, you look at the local architecture, the precedents that are there.
Now, on the Moon, it's kind of difficult, of course, because there's only this.
There's only the Apollo missions.
So last that we went there, I wasn't even born yet, and we only spent about three days there.
So for me, that's kind of a long camping trip, isn't it, but a rather expensive one.
Now, the tricky thing, when you're going to build on another planet or a moon, is how to get it there, how to get it there.
So first of all, to get a kilogram, for example, to the Moon's surface, it will cost about 200,000 dollars, very expensive.
So you want to keep it very light. Second, space. Space is limited. Right? This is the Ariane 5 rocket.
The space you have there is about four and a half meters by seven meters, not that much.
So it needs to be an architectural system that is both compact, or compactable, and light, and I think I've got one right here.
It's very compact, and it's very light.
And actually, this is one I made earlier.
Now, there's one problem with it, that inflatables are quite fragile.
They need to be protected, specifically, when you go to a very harsh environment like the Moon.
Look at it like this.
The temperature difference on a Moon base could be anything up to 200 degrees.
On one side of the base, it could be 100 degrees Celsius and on the other side, it could be minus 100 degrees.
We need to protect ourselves from that.
The Moon also does not have any magnetic fields, which means that any radiation -- solar radiation, cosmic radiation -- will hit the surface.
We need to protect ourselves from that as well, protect the astronauts from that.
And then third, but definitely not last, the Moon does not have any atmosphere, which means any meteorites coming into it will not get burned up, and they'll hit the surface.
That's why the Moon is full of craters.
Again, we need to protect the astronauts from that.
So what kind of structure do we need?
Well, the best thing is really a cave, because a cave has a lot of mass, and we need mass.
We need mass to protect ourselves from the temperatures, from the radiation and from the meteorites.
So this is how we solved it.
We have indeed the blue part, as you can see.
That's an inflatable for our Moon base.
It gives a lot of living space and a lot of lab space, and attached to it you have a cylinder, and that has all the support structures in, all the life support and also the airlock.
And on top of that, we have a structure, that domed structure, that protects ourselves, has a lot of mass in it.
Where are we going to get this material from?
Are we going to bring concrete and cement from Earth to the Moon?
Well, of course not, because it's way too heavy.
It's too expensive.
So we're going to go and use local materials.
Now, local materials are something we deal with on Earth as well.
Wherever we build or whatever country we build in, we always look at, what are the local materials here?
The problem with the Moon is, what are the local materials?
Well, there's not that many.
Actually, we have one.
It's moondust, or, fancier scientific name, regolith, Moon regolith.
Great thing is, it's everywhere, right?
The surface is covered with it.
It's about 20 centimeters up to a few meters everywhere.
But how are we going to build with it?
Well, we're going to use a 3D printer.
Whenever I ask any of you what a 3D printer is, you're probably all thinking, well, probably something about this size and it would print things that are about this size.
So of course I'm not going to bring a massive 3D printer to the Moon to print my Moon base.
I'm going to use a much smaller device, something like this one here.
So this is a small device, a small robot rover, that has a little scoop, and it brings the regolith to the dome and then it lays down a thin layer of regolith, and then you would have the robot that will solidify it, layer by layer, until it creates, after a few months, the full base.
You might have noticed that it's quite a particular structure that we're printing, and I've got a little example here.
What we call this is a closed-cell foam structure. Looks quite natural. The reason why we're using this as part of that shell structure is that we only need to solidify certain parts, which means we have to bring less binder from Earth, and it becomes much lighter.
Now -- that approach of designing something and then covering it with a protective dome we also did for our Mars project.
You can see it here, three domes.
And you see the printers printing these dome structures.
There's a big difference between Mars and the Moon, and let me explain it.
This diagram shows you to scale the size of Earth and the Moon and the real distance, about 400,000 kilometers.
If we then go to Mars, the distance from Mars to Earth -- and this picture here is taken by the rover on Mars, Curiosity, looking back at Earth.
You kind of see the little speckle there, that's Earth, 400 million kilometers away.
The problem with that distance is that it's a thousand times the distance of the Earth to the Moon, pretty far away, but there's no direct radio contact with, for example, the Curiosity rover.
So I cannot teleoperate it from Earth.
I can't say, "Oh, Mars rover, go left," because that signal would take 20 minutes to get to Mars.
Then the rover might go left, and then it will take another 20 minutes before it can tell me, "Oh yeah, I went left." So the distance, so rovers and robots and going to have to work autonomously.
The only issue with it is that missions to Mars are highly risky.
We've only seen it a few weeks ago.
So what if half the mission doesn't arrive at Mars. What do we do?
Well, instead of building just one or two rovers like we did on the Moon, we're going to build hundreds of them.
And it's a bit like a termite's mound, you know?
Termites, I would take half of the colony of the termites away, they would still be able to build the mound.
It might take a little bit longer. Same here. If half of our rovers or robots don't arrive, well, it will take a bit longer, but you will still be able to do it.
So here we even have three different rovers.
In the back, you see the digger.
It's really good at digging regolith.
Then we have the transporter, great at taking regolith and bringing it to the structure.
And the last ones, the little ones with the little legs, they don't need to move a lot.
What they do is they go and sit on a layer of regolith and then microwave it together, and layer by layer create that dome structure.
Now — we also want to try that out, so we went out on a road trip, and we created our own swarm of robots. There you go. So we built 10 of those.
It's a small swarm.
And we took six tons of sand, and we tried out how these little robots would actually be able to move sand around, Earth sand in this case.
And they were not teleoperated. Right? Nobody was telling them go left, go right, or giving them a predescribed path. No. They were given a task: move sand from this area to that area.
And if they came across an obstacle, like a rock, they had to sort it out themselves.
Or they came across another robot, they had to be able to make decisions.
Or even if half of them fell out, their batteries died, they still had to be able to finish that task.
Now, I've talked about redundancy.
But that was not only with the robots.
It was also with the habitats.
On the Mars project, we decided to do three domes, because if one didn't arrive, the other two could still form a base, and that was mainly because each of the domes actually have a life support system built in the floor, so they can work independently.
So in a way, you might think, well, this is pretty crazy.
Why would you, as an architect, get involved in space?
Because it's such a technical field.
Well, I'm actually really convinced that from a creative view or a design view, you are able to solve really hard and really constrained problems.
And I really feel that there is a place for design and architecture in projects like interplanetary habitation.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Joan Blades: Do you have politically diverse friends?
What do you talk about with them?
I'm a progressive; I live in a town full of progressives, and 15 years ago, I didn't have any conservative friends.
Now I have a wonderful mix of friends, and they include John.
John Gable: I am not a progressive.
I'm a Republican who grew up in a Republican family in the conservative South, and even worked in Republican politics, locally and at the national level.
But the last 24 years, I've been in technology and living in a very progressive area.
So I have a lot of progressive friends, including Joan.
JB: I was born in Berkeley, California, a notoriously progressive college town.
And I live there now.
In 1998, six months into the Monica Lewinsky-Clinton impeachment scandal, I helped cofound MoveOn.org with a one-sentence petition: "Congress must immediately censure the president and move on to pressing issues facing the nation." Now, that was actually a very unifying petition in many ways.
You could love Clinton or hate Clinton and agree that the best thing for the country was to move on.
As the leader of MoveOn, I saw the polarization just continue.
And I found myself wondering why I saw things so differently than many people in other parts of the country.
So in 2005, when I had an opportunity to get together with grassroots leaders across the political divide, I grabbed it.
And I became friends with a lot of people I never had a chance to talk to before.
And that included leadership in the Christian Coalition, often seen as on the right the way MoveOn is seen as on the left.
And this lead to me showing up on Capitol Hill with one of the Christian Coalition leaders, my friend, to lobby for net neutrality. That was powerful. We turned heads. So this work was transformational for me.
And I found myself wondering How could vast numbers of people have the opportunity to really connect with people that have very different views?
JG: I was born Oneida, Tennessee, right across the state border from a small coal mining town, Stearns, Kentucky.
And I lived there for the first few years of my life, before moving to another small town, Frankfort, Kentucky.
Basically, I grew up in small-town America, conservative at its heart.
Now, Stearns and Berkeley -- they're a little different.
(Laughter)
So in the '90s I moved out west to a progressive area to work in technology -- worked at Microsoft, worked at Netscape.
I actually became the product manager lead for Netscape Navigator, the first popular web browser.
Now in the early days of the internet, we were just moved and inspired by a vision: when we're connected to all these different people around the world and all these different ideas, we'll be able to make great decisions, and we'll be able to appreciate each other for the beautiful diversity that the whole world has to offer.
Now I also, 20 years ago, gave a speech saying it might not work out that way, that we might actually be trained to discriminate against each other in new ways.
So what happened? It's not like we just woke up one day and decided to hate each other more.
Here's what happened.
There's just too much noise -- too many people, too many ideas -- so we use technology to filter it out a little bit. And what happens? It lets in ideas I already agree with.
It lets in the popular ideas, it lets in people just like me who think just like me.
That sounds kind of good, right?
Well, not necessarily, because two very scary things happen when we have such narrow worldviews.
First, we become more extreme in our beliefs.
Second, we become less tolerant of anybody who's different than we are. Does this sound familiar? Does this sound like modern America? The modern world?
Well, the good news is that technology is changing, and it could change for the better.
And that's, in fact, why I started AllSides.com -- to create technologies and services to free us from these filter bubbles.
The very first thing we did was create technology that identifies bias, so we could show different perspectives side by side to free us from the filter bubbles of news media.
And then I met Joan.
JB: So I met John outside of Washington, DC, with an idealistic group of cross-partisan bridge builders, and we wanted to re-weave the fabric of our communities.
We believe that our differences can be a strength, that our values can be complimentary and that we have to overcome the fight so that we can honor everyone's values and not lose any of our own.
I went for this wonderful walk with John, where I started learning about the work he was doing to pierce the filter bubble.
It was powerful; it was brilliant.
Living in separate narratives is not good.
We can't even have a conversation or do collaborative problem-solving when we don't share the same facts.
JG: So one thing you take away from today is if Joan Blades asks you to go on a walk, go on that walk.
(Laughter)
It changed things. It really changed the way I was thinking about things.
To free ourselves from the filter bubbles, we can't just think about information filter bubbles, but also relationship and social filter bubbles.
You see, we human beings -- we're not nearly as smart as we think we are.
We don't generally make decisions intellectually. We make them emotionally, intuitively, and then we use our big old brains to rationalize anything we want to rationalize.
We're not really like Vulcans like Mr. Spock, we're more like bold cowboys like Captain Kirk, or passionate idealists like Dr. McCoy.
OK, for those of y'all who prefer the new "Star Trek" crew, here you go.
JB: Don't forget the strong women!
JG: Come on, strong women. OK.
JB: All right.
John and I are both "Star Trek" fans.
What's not to love about a future with that kind of optimism?
JG: And having a good future in mind is a big deal -- very important.
And understanding what the problem is is very important.
But we have to do something. So what do we do? It's actually not that hard.
We have to add diversity to our lives -- not just information, but relationship diversity.
And by diversity, I mean big "D" diversity, not just racial and gender, which are very important, but also... diversity of age, like young and old; rural and urban; liberal and conservative; in the US, Democrat and Republican.
Now, one of the great examples of somebody freeing themselves from their filter bubbles and getting a more diverse life is, once again, next to me -- Joan.
JB: So the question is: Who among you has had relationships lost or harmed due to differences in politics, religion or whatever? Raise your hands. Yeah. This year I have talked to so many people that have experienced that kind of loss.
I've seen tears well up in people's eyes as they talk about family members from whom they're estranged.
Living Room Conversations were designed to begin to heal political and personal differences.
They're simple conversations where two friends with different viewpoints each invite two friends for structured conversation, where everyone's agreed to some simple ground rules: curiosity, listening, respect, taking turns -- everything we learned in kindergarten, right? Really easy. So by the time you're talking about the topic you've agreed to talk about, you actually have the sense that, "You know, I kind of like this person," and you listen to each other differently.
That's kind of a human condition; we listen differently to people we care about.
And then there's reflection and possibly next steps.
This is a deep listening practice; it's never a debate.
And that's incredibly powerful.
These conversations in our own living rooms with people who have different viewpoints are an incredible adventure.
We rediscover that we can respect and even love people that are different from us.
And it's powerful.
JG: So, what are you curious about?
JB: What's the conversation you yearn to have?
JG: Let's do this together. Together.
JB: Yes.
JB and JG: Thank you.
Imagine if your daily commute involved tens of kilometers on these kinds of roads, driving this kind of vehicle, without any nearby service stations or breakdown assistance.
For millions of drivers in many parts of Africa, this is the norm.
Since over 90 percent of passenger cars are imported, often used, they're just not designed for local usage.
High import duties often compound the problem, sometimes doubling the price of a car.
So most vehicles are either too expensive or too unreliable for the average consumer.
Well-designed vehicles are only part of the transport challenge, though.
For every 100 adults in Africa, less than five people actually own a vehicle.
Public transport is available, and in countries like Kenya, it's often run by local entrepreneurs using minivans like this.
But in most rural and peri-urban areas, it's fragmented and unreliable.
In more remote areas without transport, people have to walk, typically tens of kilometers, to get to school or collect clean drinking water or buy supplies from nearby markets.
Bad roads, disparate communities, low average income levels and inadequate vehicles all impair the transport system and ultimately constrain economic output.
Despite this constraint, the Pan-African economy is booming.
Combined GDP is already over two trillion dollars.
This is a massive commercial and social opportunity, not a helpless continent.
So why isn't there already something better?
Around the world, automotive is quarter the manufacturing sector.
But in Africa, it's generally been overlooked by carmakers, who are focused on larger, established markets and emerging economies like India and China.
This lack of industrialization, which itself creates a vicious-cycle barrier to the emergence of industry, has caused the dependence on imports.
There is a supply-demand disconnect, with the vast majority of automotive spending on the continent today, essentially funding an international network of car exporters instead of fueling the growth of local industry.
It's entirely possible to solve this disconnect, though, starting with products that people actually want.
And this is what motivated me to start Mobius, to build a vehicle in Africa, for Africa.
To us, this meant reimagining the car around the needs of the consumer, simplifying nonessential features like interior fixtures and investing in performance-critical systems like suspension to create durable and affordable vehicles built for purpose.
And built for purpose is exactly where we started with our first-generation model, Mobius II, which was designed as a really rugged, low-cost SUV, able to handle heavy loads and rough terrain reliably.
This launched in 2015, and we've now developed the next-generation version based on customer feedback.
For high stress and heavy loading, we engineered a sturdy steel space frame.
To handle acute vibration from rough roads, we ruggedized the suspension.
For potholes and uneven terrain, high ground clearance was a no-brainer.
And to make this something customers could actually be proud to drive in, we designed an aspirational body aesthetic.
Underpinning all of this, we simplified or eliminated components like parking sensors and automatic windows wherever we could, to keep costs low and sell this at half the price of a five-year-old SUV in Kenya today.
The new --

The new Mobius II launches in 2018.
And while durable, affordable vehicles like this are vital, a broader solution to immobility needs to go further.
Over the last decade, a transport-centric, shared economy has connected people across Africa with minivans, auto rickshaws and sedans.
It's just not operated very effectively or efficiently.
Enabling better access to transport is all about strengthening this public transit network, empowering local entrepreneurs who already offer similar services in their communities to operate these services more profitably and more widely.
With this aim, we're taking human-centered design a step further and developing a transport platform model, which enables owners to plug in different modules, like a goods cage or ambulance unit, and run other services like goods delivery or medical transport, as well as public transport.
Transportation services like this are the fundamental driver of logistics, trade, social services, access to education, health care and employment.
The transportation grid to physical economies is akin to the internet to virtual economies.
And the impact of increased mobility is only part of the potential here.
Since the late 1700s, the Industrial Revolution has catapulted the development of economies around the world into thriving societies.
Today, manufacturing is still the engine of economic growth and stability, even as new technologies have inevitably transformed the way we live.
Making stuff is important, especially for nation-states wanting to boost employment, increase skills and reduce import dependence.
But while few countries can skip this industrialized stage, many have negligible manufacturing output.
There are various reasons for this, but one reason is universal: hardware is hard.
(Laughter)
So what are the challenges to industry, and how are we approaching them?
The first issue many people think of is a lack of skilled labor.
In areas where access to good primary and secondary education are limited and employment opportunities are scarce, a small skill base is inevitable.
But that doesn't mean it's immutable.
There's an abundance of smart, hardworking and ambitious people in Africa, obviously.
What's really lacking are good jobs that offer a path not just to employment but also professional growth.
The first person we employed at Mobius over six years ago was a mechanic named Kazungu.
Kazungu had gone to school up to the age of 18 and worked as an odd-job mechanic.
Joining the company at the time was a near-vertical learning curve.
But he rose to the challenge, and with more technical guidance from an expanding engineering team, he's grown over the years to lead a group of mechanics in R & amp; D prototyping. A thirst for learning and the work ethic to step up to a challenge are values we now recruit on.
Pairing innate values like this with on-the-job training and systems has strengthened our skill base.
This works really well on the production line, where work can be systematized around clear procedural instructions and then reinforced through training.
In our experience, it is possible to build a skilled workforce, and we plan to hire hundreds more people using this approach.
A second challenge is a lack of suppliers.
In countries like Kenya, there are only a handful of automotive suppliers manufacturing parts like electrical harnesses, seats and glass.
It's a burgeoning group, and without much demand from industry, most of these suppliers have no impetus to grow.
We've worked hard with a few of them to develop the capacity to consistently manufacture components at the quality levels we need, like this supplier in Nairobi, who are helping to reduce the production cost of metal brackets and improve their ability to build conformant parts to our engineering drawings.
Supply and development is standard practice in automotive globally, but it needs to be applied from the ground up with a vast majority of local suppliers to properly bolster the ecosystem.
And as production volumes rise, these suppliers can employ more staff, invest in better equipment and continue to develop new manufacturing techniques to further increase output.
Building up skills and suppliers are not the only hurdles to local industrialization, but they're good examples of how we think about the challenge.
You see, we're not just reimagining the car, we're reimagining our entire value chain.
None of this has been easy, and we're only just getting started.
But once African industry starts to scale, the potential is huge.
Better products, costing less, built locally, together creating millions of jobs.
Frugal innovation offers a path to economic acceleration across many industries, and the future of this continent depends on it.
The Africa 2.0 I believe in can apply locally relevant design and a commitment to solving its industrial challenges to create a more connected, more prosperous future, not just for the privileged few, but for everyone.
Thank you.
(Applause)
According to the theories of human social development, we're now living through the fourth great epoch of technological advancement, the Information Age.
Connectivity through digital technology is a modern miracle.
We can say it has broken down barriers of time and space which separate people, and it's created a condition for an age where information, ideas can be shared freely.
But are these great accomplishments in digital technology really the endgame in terms of what can be achieved?
I don't think so, and today I'd like to share with you how I believe digital technology can take us to even greater heights.
I'm a surgeon by profession, and as I stand here today talking to all of you, five billion people around the world lack access to safe surgical care. Five billion people. That's 70 percent of the world's population, who according to the WHO's Lancet Commission can't even access simple surgical procedures as and when they need them.
Let's zoom in on Sierra Leone, a country of six million people, where a recent study showed that there are only 10 qualified surgeons.
That's one surgeon for every 600,000 people.
The numbers are staggering, and we don't even need to look that far.
If we look around us here in the US, a recent study reported that we need an extra 100,000 surgeons by 2030 to just keep up with the demand for routine surgical procedures.
At the rate that we're going, we won't be meeting those numbers.
As a surgeon, this is a global issue that bothers me.
It bothers me a lot, because I've seen firsthand how lack of access to safe and affordable healthcare can blight the lives of ordinary people.
If you're a patient that needs an operation and there isn't a surgeon available, you're left with some really difficult choices: to wait, to travel, or not to have an operation at all.
So what's the answer? Well, part of you are carrying some of that solution with you today: a smartphone, a tablet, a computer.
Because for me, digital communications technology has the power to do so much more than just to allow us to shop online, to connect through social media platforms and to stay up to date.
It has the power to help us solve some of the key issues that we face, like lack of access to vital surgical services.
And today I'd like to share with you an example of how I think we can make that possible.
The history of surgery is filled with breakthroughs in how science and technology was able to help the surgeons of the day face their greatest challenges.
If we go back several hundred years, an understanding of microbiology led to the development of antiseptic techniques, which played a big role in making sure patients were able to stay alive postsurgery.
Fast-forward a few hundred years and we developed keyhole or arthroscopic surgery, which combines video technology and precision instruments to make surgery less invasive.
And more recently, a lot of you will be aware of robotic surgery, and what robotics brings to surgery is much like modern automated machinery, ultraprecision, the ability to carry out procedures at the tiniest scales with a degree of accuracy that even surpasses the human hand.
But robotic surgery also introduced something else to surgery: the idea that a surgeon doesn't actually have to be standing at the patient's bedside to deliver care, that he could be looking at a screen and instructing a robot through a computer.
We call this remote surgery.
It is incumbent on us to find solutions that solve these answers in a cost-effective and scalable way, so that everyone, no matter where they are in the world, can have these problems addressed.
So what if I told you that you didn't really need a million-dollar robot to provide remote surgery?
That all you needed was a phone, a tablet, or a computer, an internet connection, a confident colleague on the ground and one magic ingredient: an augmented reality collaboration software.
Using this augmented reality collaboration software, an expert surgeon can now virtually transport himself into any clinical setting simply by using his phone or tablet or computer, and he can visually and practically interact in an operation from start to finish, guiding and mentoring a local doctor through the procedure step by step.
Well, enough of me telling you about it.
I'd now like to show you.
We're now going to go live to Dr. Marc Tompkins, an orthopedic surgeon at the University of Minnesota.
He's going to perform an arthroscopic surgery for us, a keyhole surgery of the knee, and I'd like to disclose that this patient has consented to having their operation streamed.
I'd also like to point out that in the interest of time, we're just going to go through the first steps, marking up the patient and just identifying a few key anatomical landmarks.
Hello, Dr. Tompkins, can you hear me?
Dr. Mark Tompkins: Good morning, Nadine.
Nadine Hachach-Haram: Everyone from TED says hello.
Audience: Hi.
NHH: Alright, Dr. Tompkins, let's get started.
So let's start with our incisions and where we're going to make these, on either side of the patellar tendon.
So if you can make your incisions there and there, that should hopefully get us into the knee.
MT: All right, I'm going in.
NHH: Great. So we're just getting inside the joint now.
So why don't we go around and have a quick look at the meniscus.
MT: Perfect.
NHH: Great, so we can see there's a small tear there on the meniscus, but otherwise it looks alright.
And if you turn and head to this direction, follow my finger, let's have a quick look at the ACL and the PCL.
That's your ACL there, that looks quite healthy, no problems there.
So we've just identified that small meniscus tear there, but otherwise the fluid around the joint looks OK as well.
All right, thank you very much, Dr. Tompkins.
Thank you for your time.
I'll let you continue. Have a good day. Bye.
(Applause)
So I hope through this simple demonstration I was able to illustrate to you just how powerful this technology can be.
And I'd like to point out that I wasn't using any special equipment, just my laptop and a really simple webcam.
We're so used to using digital technology to communicate through voice and text and video, but augmented reality can do something so much deeper.
It allows two people to virtually interact in a way that mimics how they would collaborate in person.
Being able to show someone what you want to do, to illustrate and demonstrate and gesture, is so much more powerful than just telling them.
And it can make for such a great learning tool, because we learn better through direct experience.
So how is this making a difference around the world?
Well, back in my teaching hospital, we've been using this to support local district general hospitals and providing skin cancer surgery and trauma treatment.
Now, patients can access care at a local level.
This reduces their travel time, improves their access, and saves money.
We've even started seeing its use in wound care management with nurses and in outpatient management.
Most recently, and quite exciting, it was used in supporting a surgeon through a cancer removal of a kidney.
And I'd like to just share with you a very quick video here.
I apologize for some of the gruesome views.
(Video) Doctor 1: OK. Show me again.
Doctor 2: If you see here, that's the upper part, the most outer part of your tumor.
Doctor 1: Yes.
Doctor 2: So it's three centimeters deep, so this should be three centimeters.
Doctor 1: Yes, yes.
Doctor 2: OK, so you need to get a 3.5 margin.
Doctor 1: I'm going to show you anyway and tell me what you think about it.
NHH: We're also seeing the use of this technology at a global scale, and one of the most heartwarming stories I can recall is from the town of Trujillo in the north of Lima in Peru, where this technology was used to support the provision of cleft lip and palate surgery to children, children from poor backgrounds who didn't have access to health insurance.
And in this town, there was a hospital with one surgeon working hard to provide this care, Dr. Soraya.
Now, Dr. Soraya was struggling under the sheer demand of her local population, as well as the fact that she wasn't specifically trained in this procedure.
And so, with the help of a charity, we were able to connect her with a cleft surgeon in California, and using this technology, he was able to guide her and her colleagues through the procedure step by step, guiding them, training them and teaching them.
Within a few months, they were able to perform 30 percent more operations with less and less complications.
And now Dr. Soraya and her team can perform these operations independently, competently and confidently.
And I remember one quote from a mother who said, "This technology gave my daughter her smile."
For me, this is the real power of this technology.
The beauty is that it breaks boundaries.
It transcends all technological difficulties. It connects people. It democratizes access. Wi-Fi and mobile technology are growing rapidly, and they should play a role in boosting surgical provision.
We've even seen it used in conflict zones where there's considerable risk in getting specialist surgeons to certain locations.
In a world where there are more mobile devices than there are human beings, it truly has a global reach.
Of course, we've still got a long way before we can solve the problem of getting surgery to five billion people, and unfortunately, some people still don't have access to internet.
But things are rapidly moving in the right direction.
The potential for change is there.
My team and I are growing our global footprint, and we're starting to see the potential of this technology.
Through digital technology, through simple, everyday devices that we take for granted, through devices of the future, we can really do miraculous things.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hank Willis Thomas: I'm Deb's son. (Laughter)
HWT: We've said that so many times, we've made a piece about it. It's called "Sometimes I See Myself In You," and it speaks to the symbiotic relationship that we've developed over the years through our life and work.
And really, it's because everywhere we go, together or apart, we carry these monikers.
I've been following in my mother's footsteps since before I was even born and haven't figured out how to stop.
And as I get older, it does get harder.
(Laughter) No seriously, it gets harder. My mother's taught me many things, though, most of all that love overrules.
She's taught me that love is an action, not a feeling.
Love is a way of being, it's a way of doing, it's a way of listening and it's a way of seeing.
DW: And also, the idea about love, photographers, they're looking for love when they make photographs.
They're looking and looking and finding love.
Growing up in North Philadelphia, I was surrounded by people in my family and friends who made photographs and used the family camera as a way of telling a story about life, about life of joy, about what it meant to become a family in North Philadelphia.
So I spent most of my life searching for pictures that reflect on ideas about black love, black joy and about family life.
So it's really important to think about the action of love overrules as a verb.
HWT: Sometimes I wonder if the love of looking is genetic, because, like my mother, I've loved photographs since before I can even remember.
I think sometimes that -- after my mother and her mother -- that photography and photographs were my first love.
No offense to my father, but that's what you get for calling me a "ham" wherever you go.
I remember whenever I'd go to my grandmother's house, she would hide all the photo albums because she was afraid of me asking, "Well, who is that in that picture?" and "Who are they to you and who are they to me, and how old were you when that picture was taken?
How old was I when that picture was taken?
And why were they in black and white?
Was the world in black and white before I was born?"
DW: Well, that's interesting, just to think about the world in black and white.
I grew up in a beauty shop in North Philadelphia, my mom's beauty shop, looking at "Ebony Magazine," found images that told stories that were often not in the daily news, but in the family album.
I wanted the family album to be energetic for me, a way of telling stories, and one day I happened upon a book in the Philadelphia Public Library called "The Sweet Flypaper of Life" by Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes.
I think what attracted me as a seven-year-old, the title, flypaper and sweet, but to think about that as a seven-year-old, I looked at the beautiful images that Roy DeCarava made and then looked at ways that I could tell a story about life.
And looking for me is the act that basically changed my life.
HWT: My friend Chris Johnson told me that every photographer, every artist, is essentially trying to answer one question, and I think your question might have been, "Why doesn't the rest of the world see how beautiful we are, and what can I do to help them see our community the way I do?"
DW: While studying in art school -- it's probably true -- I had a male professor who told me that I was taking up a good man's space.
He tried to stifle my dream of becoming a photographer.
He attempted to shame me in a class full of male photographers.
He told me I was out of place and out of order as a woman, and he went on to say that all you could and would do was to have a baby when a good man could have had your seat in this class.
I was shocked into silence into that experience.
But I had my camera, and I was determined to prove to him that I was worthy for a seat in that class.
But in retrospect, I asked myself: "Why did I need to prove it to him?" You know, I had my camera, and I knew I needed to prove to myself that I would make a difference in photography.
I love photography, and no one is going to stop me from making images.
HWT: But that's when I came in.
DW: Yeah, that year I graduated, I got pregnant.
Yep, he was right.
And I had you, and I shook off that sexist language that he used against me and picked up my camera and made photographs daily, and made photographs of my pregnant belly as I prepared for graduate school.
But I thought about also that black photographers were missing from the history books of photography, and I was looking for ways to tell a story.
And I ran across Gordon Parks' book "A Choice of Weapons," which was his autobiography.
I began photographing and making images, and I tucked away that contact sheet that I made of my pregnant belly, and then you inspired me to create a new piece, a piece that said, "A woman taking a place from a good man," "You took the space from a good man," and then I used that language and reversed it and said, "I made a space for a good man, you."
(Applause) HWT: Thanks, ma.
Like mother, like son.
I grew up in a house full of photographs.
They were everywhere, and my mother would turn the kitchen into a darkroom.
And there weren't just pictures that she took and pictures of family members.
(Laughter) But there were pictures on the wall of and by people that we didn't know, men and women that we didn't know. Thanks, ma.
(Laughter) Puppet strings.
(Applause) I grew up in a house full of photographs.
But they weren't just pictures of men and women that we knew, but pictures of people that I didn't know, Pretty much, it was pretty clear from what I learned in school, that the rest of the world didn't either.
And it took me a long time to figure out what she was up to, but after a while, I figured it out.
When I was nine years old, she published this book, "Black Photographers, 1840-1940: A Bio-Bibliography." And it's astounding to me to consider that in 1840, African Americans were making photographs.
What does it mean for us to think that at a time that was two, three decades before the end of slavery, that people were learning how to read, they had to learn how to do math, they had to be on the cutting edge of science and technology, to do math, physics and chemistry just to make a single photograph.
And what compelled them to do that if not love?
Well, that book led her to her next book, "Black Photographers, 1940-1988," and that book led to another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another book, and another. (Applause)
And throughout my life, she's edited and published dozens of books and curated numerous exhibitions on every continent, not all about black photographers but all inspired by the curiosity of a little black girl from North Philadelphia.
DW: What I found is that black photographers had stories to tell, and we needed to listen.
And then I found and I discovered black photographers like Augustus Washington, who made these beautiful daguerreotypes of the McGill family in the early 1840s and '50s.
Their stories tended to be different, black photographers, and they had a different narrative about black life during slavery, but it was also about family life, beauty and telling stories about community.
I didn't know how to link the stories, but I knew that teachers needed to know this story.
HWT: So I think I was my mother's first student.
Unwillingly and unwittingly -- puppet strings -- I decided to pick up a camera, and thought that I should make my own pictures about the then and now and the now and then.
I thought about how I could use photography to talk about how what's going on outside of the frame of the camera can affect what we see inside.
The truth is always in the hands of the actual image maker and it's up to us to really consider what's being cut out.
I thought I could use her research as a jumping-off point of things that I was seeing in society and I wanted to start to think about how I could use historical images to talk about the past being present and think about ways that we can speak to the perennial struggle for human rights and equal rights through my appropriation of photographs in the form of sculpture, video, installation and paintings.
But through it all, one piece has affected me the most.
It continues to nourish me.
It's based off of this photograph by Ernest Withers, who took this picture in 1968 at the Memphis Sanitation Workers March of men and women standing collectively to affirm their humanity.
They were holding signs that said "I am a man," and I found that astounding, because the phrase I grew up with wasn't "I am a man," it was "I am the man," and I was amazed at how it went from this collective statement during segregation to this seemingly selfish statement after integration.
And I wanted to ponder that, so I decided to remix that text in as many ways as I could think of, and I like to think of the top line as a timeline of American history, and the last line as a poem, and it says, "I am the man.
Who's the man. You the man. What a man. I am man. I am many. I am, am I. I am, I am.
I am, Amen.
DW: Wow, so fascinating.
(Applause) But what we learn from this experience is the most powerful two words in the English language is, "I am." And we each have the capacity to love.
(Applause) Thank you.
The longest journey that I have ever taken. That was in 2002.
I was only 19 years old.
It was the first time I had ever been on an airplane and the first time that I had left my country, Rwanda.
I had to move thousands of kilometers away to follow a dream.
A dream I have had ever since I was a child.
And that dream was to become an architect.
That was impossible at the time in my country.
There were no schools of architecture.
So when I got a scholarship to study in China, I left my life and my family behind and I moved to Shanghai.
It was an amazing time.
This country was going through a major building boom.
Shanghai, my new home, was quickly turning into a skyscraper city. China was changing. World-class projects were built to convey a new image of development.
Modern, striking engineering marvels were going up literally everywhere.
But behind these facades, exploitation of huge numbers of migrant workers, massive displacement of thousands of people made these projects possible.
And this fast-paced development also contributed significantly to the pollution that is haunting China today.
Fast-forward to 2010, when I went back home to Rwanda.
There, I found development patterns similar to what I saw in China.
The country was and still is experiencing its own population and economic growth.
The pressure to build cities, infrastructure and buildings is at its peak, and as a result, there is a massive building boom as well.
This is the reality across the entire continent of Africa, and here's why. By 2050, Africa's population will double, reaching 2.5 billion people.
At this point, the African population will be slightly less than the current population of China and India combined.
The infrastructure and buildings needed to accommodate this many people is unprecedented in the history of humankind.
We have estimated that by 2050, we have to build 700,000,000 more housing units, more than 300,000 schools and nearly 100,000 health centers.
Let me put that into perspective for you.
Every day for the next 35 years, we have to build seven health centers, 25 schools and nearly 60,000 housing units each day, every day.
How are we going to build all of this? Are we going to follow a model of unsustainable building and construction similar to what I witnessed in China?
Or can we develop a uniquely African model of sustainable and equitable development? I'm optimistic we can. I know Africans who are already doing it.
Take Nigerian architect Kunlé Adeyemi for instance, and his work in slums of coastal megacities.
Places like Makoko in Lagos, where hundreds of thousands of people live in makeshift structures on stilts on water, without government infrastructure or services.
A community at great risk of rising sea levels and climate change.
And yet, people who live here are examples of great ingenuity and the will to survive.
Kunlé and his team have designed a prototype school that is resilient to rising sea levels.
This is Makoko School.
It's a floating prototype structure that can be adapted to clinics, to housing, to markets and other vital infrastructure this community needs.
It's an ingenious solution that can ensure this community lives safely on the waters of Lagos.
This is Francis Kéré. He works in the country where he comes from, Burkina Faso.
Kéré and his team have designed projects that use traditional building techniques.
Kéré and his team working in the communities have developed prototype schools that the whole community, similar to every project in the villages of this country, comes together to build.
Children bring stones for the foundation, women bring water for the brick manufacturing, and everybody works together to pound the clay floors.
Working with the community, Kéré and his team have created projects that function better, with adequate lighting and adequate ventilation.
They're appropriate for this particular context and really, really beautiful as well.
For the past seven years, I have been working as an architect at MASS Design Group.
It's a design firm that began in Rwanda.
We have worked in several countries in Africa, focusing on this more equitable and sustainable model of architectural practice, and Malawi is one of those countries.
It's a country with beautiful, remote landscapes with high-peak mountains and fertile valleys.
But it also has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the world.
A pregnant woman in Malawi either gives birth at home, or she has to walk a really long journey to the nearest clinic.
And one out of 36 of these mothers dies during childbirth.
In Malawi, with our team at MASS Design Group, we designed the Kasungu Maternity Waiting Village.
This is a place women come to six weeks before their due dates.
Here they receive prenatal care and train in nutrition and family planning.
At the same time, they form a community with other expectant mothers and their families.
The design of the of Kasungu Maternity Waiting Village borrows from the vernacular typologies of Malawi villages and is built using really simple materials and techniques.
The earth blocks that we used were made from the same soil of this site.
This reduces the carbon footprint of this building, but first and foremost, it provides a safe and dignified space for these expectant mothers.
These examples show that architecture and design have the power and the agency to address complex problems.
But more to point, that we can develop a model of effective solutions for our communities.
But these three examples are not enough.
300 more examples will not be enough.
We need a whole community of African architects and designers to lead with thousands more examples.
In May of this year, we convened a symposium on African architecture, in Kigali, and we invited many of the leading African designers and architectural educators working across the continent.
We all had one thing in common.
Every single one of us went to school abroad and outside of Africa. This has to change. If we are to develop solutions unique to us, rather than attempting to turn Kigali into Beijing, or Lagos into Shenzhen, we need a community that will build the design confidence of the next generation of African architects and designers.
(Applause)
In September last year, we launched the African Design Centre to start building this community.
We admitted 11 fellows from across the continent.
It's a 20-month-long, design-build fellowship program.
Here, they are learning to tackle big challenges such as urbanism and climate change, as Kunlé and his team have.
They're working with communities to develop innovative building solutions and processes, as Kéré and his team have.
They're learning to understand the health impact of better buildings as we at MASS Design Group have been researching for the past several years.
The crowning moment of the fellowship is a real project that they designed and built.
This is Ruhehe Primary School, the project they designed.
They immersed themselves in the community to understand the challenges but also uncover opportunities, like using a wall made of local volcanic stone to turn the entire campus into a space of play and active learning.
They evaluated the environmental conditions and developed a roof system that maximizes daylight and improves acoustic performance.
The construction at Ruhehe Primary School will begin this year.
(Applause)
And over the coming months, the African Design Centre fellows are going to work hand-in-hand with the Ruhehe community to build it.
When we asked the fellows what they want to do after their African Design Centre fellowship, Tshepo from South Africa said he wants to introduce this new way of building into his country, so he plans to open a private practice in Johannesburg.
Zani wants to expand opportunities for women to become engineers.
Before joining the African Design Centre, she helped start, in Nairobi, an organization to bridge the gender gaps for women in engineering fields, and she hopes to take this movement across Africa, eventually the whole world.
Moses, from South Sudan, the world's newest country, wants to open the first polytechnic school that will teach people how to build using local materials from his country.
Moses had to be determined to become an architect.
The civil war in his country frequently interrupted his architectural education.
At the time he was applying to join the African Design Centre, we could hear gunshots going off in the background of his interview call.
But even in the middle of this civil war, Moses hangs on to this idea that architecture can be a way to bridge communities back together.
You have to be inspired by this fellow's belief that great architecture can make a difference on how the future of Africa is built.
The unprecedented growth of Africa cannot be ignored.
Imagine Africa's future cities, but not as vast slums, but the most resilient and the most socially inclusive places on earth. This is achievable. And we have the talent to make it a reality.
But the journey to ready that talent for the task ahead, like my own journey, is far too long.
For the next generation of African creative leaders, we have to shorten and streamline that journey.
But most importantly -- and I cannot stress this enough -- we have to build their design confidence and empower them to develop solutions that are truly African but globally inspiring.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
There's an ancient parable about a farmer who lost his horse.
And neighbors came over to say, "Oh, that's too bad." And the farmer said, "Good or bad, hard to say." Days later, the horse returns and brings with it seven wild horses.
And neighbors come over to say, "Oh, that's so good!" And the farmer just shrugs and says, "Good or bad, hard to say." The next day, the farmer's son rides one of the wild horses, is thrown off and breaks his leg.
And the neighbors say, "Oh, that's terrible luck." And the farmer says, "Good or bad, hard to say." Eventually, officers come knocking on people's doors, looking for men to draft for an army, and they see the farmer's son and his leg and they pass him by.
And neighbors say, "Ooh, that's great luck!" And the farmer says, "Good or bad, hard to say."
I first heard this story 20 years ago, and I have since applied it 100 times.
Didn't get the job I wanted: good or bad, hard to say.
good or bad, hard to say. Got the job I wanted:
To me, the story is not about looking on the bright side or waiting to see how things turn out.
It's about how eager we can be to label a situation, to put concrete around it by judging it.
But reality is much more fluid, and good and bad are often incomplete stories that we tell ourselves.
The parable has been my warning that by gripping tightly to the story of good or bad, I close down my ability to truly see a situation.
I learn more when I proceed and loosen my grip and proceed openly with curiosity and wonder.
But seven years ago, when I was pregnant with my first child, I completely forgot this lesson.
I believed I knew wholeheartedly what was good.
When it came to having kids, I thought that good was some version of a superbaby, some ultrahealthy human who possessed not a single flaw and would practically wear a cape flying into her superhero future.
I took DHA pills to ensure that my baby had a super-high-functioning, supersmart brain, and I ate mostly organic food, and I trained for a medication-free labor, and I did many other things because I thought these things would help me make not just a good baby, but the best baby possible.
When my daughter Fiona was born, she weighed 4 pounds, 12 ounces, or 2.15 kilograms.
The pediatrician said there were only two possible explanations for her tiny size. "Either," he said, "it's bad seed," "or it's bad soil." And I wasn't so tired from labor to lose the thread of his logic: my newborn, according to the doctor, was a bad plant.
Eventually, I learned that my daughter had an ultra-rare chromosomal condition called Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.
She was missing a chunk of her fourth chromosome.
And although my daughter was good -- she was alive, and she had brand new baby skin and the most aware onyx eyes -- I also learned that people with her syndrome have significant developmental delays and disabilities.
Some never learn to walk or talk.
I did not have the equanimity of the farmer.
The situation looked unequivocally bad to me.
But here's where the parable is so useful, because for weeks after her diagnosis, I felt gripped by despair, locked in the story that all of this was tragic.
Reality, though -- thankfully -- is much more fluid, and it has much more to teach.
As I started to get to know this mysterious person who was my kid, my fixed, tight story of tragedy loosened.
It turned out my girl loved reggae, and she would smirk when my husband would bounce her tiny body up and down to the rhythm.
Her onyx eyes eventually turned the most stunning Lake Tahoe blue, and she loved using them to gaze intently into other people's eyes.
At five months old, she could not hold her head up like other babies, but she could hold this deep, intent eye contact.
One friend said, "She's the most aware baby I've ever seen."
But where I saw the gift of her calm, attentive presence, an occupational therapist who came over to our house to work with Fiona saw a child who was neurologically dull.
This therapist was especially disappointed that Fiona wasn't rolling over yet, and so she told me we needed to wake her neurology up.
One day she leaned over my daughter's body, took her tiny shoulders, jostled her and said, "Wake up!
Wake up! "We had a few therapists visit our house that first year, and they usually focused on what they thought was bad about my kid.
I was really happy when Fiona started using her right hand to bully a dangling stuffed sheep, but the therapist was fixated on my child's left hand.
Fiona had a tendency not to use this hand very often, and she would cross the fingers on that hand.
So the therapist said we should devise a splint, which would rob my kid of the ability to actually use those fingers, but it would at least force them into some position that looked normal.
In that first year, I was starting to realize a few things.
One: ancient parables aside, my kid had some bad therapists.
(Laughter)
Two: I had a choice.
Like a person offered to swallow a red pill or a blue pill, I could choose to see my daughter's differences as bad; I could strive toward the goal that her therapists called, "You'd never know." They loved to pat themselves on the back when they could say about a kid, "You'd never know he was 'delayed' or 'autistic' or 'different.'" I could believe that the good path was the path that erased as many differences as possible.
Of course, this would have been a disastrous pursuit, because at the cellular level, my daughter had rare blueprints.
She wasn't designed to be like other people.
She would lead a rare life.
So, I had another choice: I could drop my story that neurological differences and developmental delays and disabilities were bad, which means I could also drop my story that a more able-bodied life was better.
I could release my cultural biases about what made a life good or bad and simply watch my daughter's life as it unfolded with openness and curiosity.
One afternoon she was lying on her back, and she arched her back on the carpet stuck her tongue out of the side of her mouth and managed to torque her body onto her belly.
Then she tipped over and rolled back onto her back, and once there, she managed to do it all over again, rolling and wiggling her 12-pound self under a coffee table.
At first, I thought she'd gotten stuck there, but then I saw her reaching for something that her eye had been on all along: a black electric cord.
She was a year old.
Other babies her age were for sure pulling up to stand and toddling around, some of them.
good or bad, hard to say. To some, my kid's situation looked bad: a one-year-old who could only roll. But screw that. My kid was enjoying the new, limber freedom of mobility. I rejoiced. Then again, what I watched that afternoon was a baby yanking on an electric cord, so you know,
(Laughter)
I started seeing that when I released my grip about what made a life good or bad, I could watch my daughter's life unfold and see what it was.
It was beautiful, it was complicated, joyful, hard -- in other words: just another expression of the human experience.
Eventually, my family and I moved to a new state in America, and we got lucky with a brand-new batch of therapists.
They didn't focus on all that was wrong with my kid.
They didn't see her differences as problems to fix.
They acknowledged her limitations, but they also saw her strengths, and they celebrated her for who she was.
Their goal wasn't to make Fiona as normal as possible; their goal was simply to help her be as independent as possible so that she could fulfill her potential, however that looked for her.
But the culture at large does not take this open attitude about disabilities.
We call congenital differences "birth defects," as though human beings were objects on a factory line.
We might offer pitying expressions when we learn that a colleague had a baby with Down syndrome.
We hail a blockbuster film about a suicidal wheelchair user, despite the fact that actual wheelchair users tell us that stereotype is unfair and damaging.
And sometimes our medical institutions decide what lives are not worth living.
Such is the case with Amelia Rivera, a girl with my daughter's same syndrome.
In 2012, a famous American children's hospital initially denied Amelia the right to a lifesaving kidney transplant because, according to their form, as it said, she was "mentally retarded." This is the way that the story of disabilities as bad manifests in a culture.
But there's a surprisingly insidious counterstory -- the story, especially, that people with intellectual disabilities are good because they are here to teach us something magical, or they are inherently angelic and always sweet.
You have heard this ableist trope before: the boy with Down syndrome who's one of God's special children, or the girl with the walker and the communication device who is a precious little angel.
This story rears its head in my daughter's life around Christmastime, when certain people get positively giddy at the thought of seeing her in angel's wings and a halo at the pageant.
The insinuation is that these people don't experience the sticky complexities of being human.
And although at times, especially as a baby, my daughter has, in fact, looked angelic, she has grown into the type of kid who does the rascally things that any other kid does, such as when she, at age four, shoved her two-year-old sister.
My girl deserves the right to annoy the hell out of you, like any other kid.
When we label a person tragic or angelic, bad or good, we rob them of their humanity, along with not only the messiness and complexity that that title brings, but the rights and dignities as well.
My girl does not exist to teach me things or any of us things, but she has indeed taught me: number one, how many mozzarella cheese sticks a 22-pound human being can consume in one day -- which is five, for the record; and two, the gift of questioning my culture's beliefs about what makes a life good and what makes life bad.
If you had told me six years ago that my daughter would sometimes use and iPad app to communicate, I might have thought that was sad.
But now I recall the first day I handed Fiona her iPad, loaded with a thousand words, each represented by a tiny little icon or little square on her iPad app.
And I recall how bold and hopeful it felt, even as some of her therapists said that my expectations were way too high, that she would never be able to hit those tiny targets.
And I recall watching in awe as she gradually learned to flex her little thumb and hit the buttons to say words she loved, like "reggae" and "cheese" and a hundred other words she loved that her mouth couldn't yet say.
And then we had to teach her less-fun words, prepositions -- words like "of" and "on" and "in." And we worked on this for a few weeks.
And then I recall sitting at a dining room table with many relatives, and, apropos of absolutely nothing, Fiona used her iPad app to say, "poop in toilet."
(Laughter)
Good or bad, hard to say.
(Laughter)
My kid is human, that's all.
And that is a lot.
Thank you.
(Applause)
How many of you are tired of seeing celebrities adopting kids from the African continent?
(Laughter)
Well, it's not all that bad. I was adopted. I grew up in rural Uganda, lost both my parents when I was very, very young.
And when my parents passed, I experienced all the negative effects of poverty, from homelessness, eating out of trash piles, you name it.
But my life changed when I got accepted into an orphanage.
Through one of those sponsor-an-orphan programs, I was sponsored and given an opportunity to acquire an education.
I started off in Uganda.
I went through school, and the way this particular program worked, you finished high school and after high school, you go learn a trade -- to become a carpenter, a mechanic or something along those lines.
My case was a little different.
The sponsor family that was sending these 25 dollars a month to this orphanage to sponsor me, which -- I had never met them -- said, "Well ... we would like to send you to college instead." Oh -- it gets better.
(Laughter)
And they said, "If you get the paperwork, we'll send you to school in America instead." So with their help, I went to the embassy and applied for the visa.
I got the visa.
I remember this day like it was yesterday.
I walked out of the embassy with this piece of paper in my hand, a hop in my step, smile on my face, knowing that my life is about to change.
I went home that night, and I slept with my passport, because I was afraid that someone might steal it.
(Laughter)
I couldn't fall asleep. I kept feeling it. I had a good idea for security.
I was like, "OK, I'm going to put it in a plastic bag, and take it outside and dig a hole, and put it in there." I did that, went back in the house.
I could not fall asleep.
I was like, "Maybe someone saw me." I went back —
(Laughter)
I pulled it out, and I put it with me the entire night -- all to say that it was an anxiety-filled night.
(Laughter)
Going to the US was, just like another speaker said, was my first time to see a plane, be on one, let alone sit on it to fly to another country.
December 15, 2006. 7: 08pm. I sat in seat 7A. Fly Emirates. One of the most gorgeous, beautiful women I've ever seen walked up, red little hat with a white veil.
I'm looking terrified, I have no idea what I'm doing.
She hands me this warm towel -- warm, steamy, snow white.
I'm looking at this warm towel; I don't know what to do with my life, let alone with this damn towel --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I did one of the -- you know, anything anyone could do in that situation: look around, see what everyone else is doing.
I did the same.
Mind you, I drove about seven hours from my village to the airport that day.
So I grab this warm towel, wipe my face just like everyone else is doing, I look at it -- damn.
(Laughter)
It was all dirt brown.
(Laughter)
I remember being so embarrassed that when she came by to pick it up, I didn't give mine.
(Laughter)
I still have it.
(Laughter)
Going to America opened doors for me to live up to my full God-given potential.
I remember when I arrived, the sponsor family embraced me, and they literally had to teach me everything from scratch: this is a microwave, that's a refrigerator -- things I'd never seen before.
And it was also the first time I got immersed into a new and different culture.
These strangers showed me true love.
These strangers showed me that I mattered, that my dreams mattered.
(Applause)
Thank you.
These individuals had two of their own biological children.
And when I came in, I had needs.
They had to teach me English, teach me literally everything, which resulted in them spending a lot of time with me.
And that created a little bit of jealousy with their children.
So, if you're a parent in this room, and you have those teenager children who don't want anything to do with your love and affection — in fact, they find it repulsive — I got a solution: adopt a child.
(Laughter)
It will solve the problem.
I went on to acquire two engineering degrees from one of the best institutions in the world.
I've got to tell you: talent is universal, but opportunities are not.
And I credit this to the individuals who embrace multiculturalism, love, empathy and compassion for others.
We live in a world filled with hate: building walls, Brexit, xenophobia here on the African continent.
Multiculturalism can be an answer to many of these worst human qualities.
Today, I challenge you to help a young child experience multiculturalism.
I guarantee you that will enrich their life, and in turn, it will enrich yours.
And as a bonus, one of them may even give a TED Talk.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
We may not be able to solve the bigotry and the racism of this world today, but certainly we can raise children to create a positive, inclusive, connected world full of empathy, love and compassion.
Love wins.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good evening, everyone.
I am from Japan, so I'd like to start with a story about Japanese fishing villages.
In the past, every fisherman was tempted to catch as many as fish as possible, but if everybody did that, the fish, common shared resource in the community, would disappear.
The result would be hardship and poverty for everyone.
This happened in some cases, but it did not happen in other cases.
In these communities, the fishermen developed a kind of social contract that told each one of them to hold back a bit to prevent overfishing.
The fisherman would keep an eye on each other.
There would be a penalty if you were caught cheating. But once the benefit of a social contract became clear to everyone, the incentive to cheat dramatically dropped.
We find the same story around the world.
This is how villagers in medieval Europe managed pasture and forests.
This is how communities in Asia managed water, and this is how indigenous peoples in the Amazon managed wildlife.
These communities realized they relied on a finite, shared resource.
They developed rules and practices on how to manage those resources, and they changed their behavior so that they could continue to rely on those shared resources tomorrow by not overfishing, not overgrazing, not polluting or depleting water streams today.
This is a story of the commons, and also how to avoid the so-called tragedy of the commons.
But this is also a story of an economy that was mainly local, where everybody had a very strong sense of belonging.
Our economies are no longer local.
When we moved away from being local, we started to lose our connection to the commons.
We carried economic objectives, goals and systems beyond the local, but we did not carry the notion of taking care of the commons.
So our oceans, forests, once very close to us as our local commons, moved very far away from us.
So today, we pump millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the air, we dump plastics, fertilizers and industrial waste into the rivers and oceans, and we cut down forests that absorb CO2.
We make the wild biodiversity much more fragile.
We seem to have totally forgotten that there is such a thing as global commons: air, water, forests and biodiversity.
Now, it is modern science that reminds us how vital the global commons are.
In 2009, a group of scientists proposed how to assess the health of the global commons.
They defined nine planetary boundaries vital to our survival, then they measured how far we could go before we cross over the tipping points or thresholds that would lead us to the irreversible or even catastrophic change.
This is where we were in the 1950s.
We broadly remained within safe operating space, marked by the green line.
But look at where we are now.
We have crossed four of those boundaries, and we will be crossing others in the future.
How did we end up in this situation?
Well, my personal story may tell us something.
Five years ago, I was appointed as CEO of the GEF, Global Environment Facility, but I am not a conservationist or an environmental activist.
I am an economist, and for the last 30 years, I had worked for public finance in my home country and around the world.
I can tell you one thing for sure: during these 30 years, the notion of the global commons never crossed my mind.
I didn't have a single conversation about the global commons with my colleagues.
This tells me that the notion of the global commons was not really entering into the big money decisions like state budgets or investment plans.
And I'm wondering, why do we have this sheer ignorance about the global commons, including me, myself?
One possible explanation might be that until recently, it didn't really matter too much.
Even if we mess up some part of the environment, we were not fundamentally changing the functions of the earth system.
The global commons had still enough capacity to take the punches we gave them.
In fact, the fish were still plentiful, the fields for grazing were still vast.
Our mistake was to assume that the capacity of the earth for self-repair had no limits.
It does have limits.
The message from the science is very clear: we humans have become an overwhelming force to determine the future living conditions on earth, and what's more, we are running out of time.
If we don't act on them, we will be losing the global commons.
It's only our generation who are able to preserve it -- preserve the commons as we know them.
Now is the time we start managing the global commons as our parents or our grandparents managed their local commons.
The first thing we need to do is to simply recognize that we do have the global commons and they are very, very important.
But what does it mean in practice? Where to start with? I see there are four key economic systems that fundamentally need to change.
First, we need to change our cities.
By 2050, two thirds of our population will live in cities.
We need green cities.
Second, we need to change our energy system.
The world economy must sharply decarbonize, essentially in one generation.
Third, we need to change our production-consumption system.
We need to break away from current take-make-waste consumption patterns.
And finally, we need to change our food system, what to eat and how to produce it.
And all of those four systems are putting enormous pressure on the global commons, and it's also very difficult to flip them.
They are extremely complex, with many decision-makers, actors involved.
Let's take the example of the food system.
Food production is currently responsible for one quarter of greenhouse gas emissions.
It is also a main user of the world's water resources.
In fact, 70 percent of today's water is used to grow crops.
Vast areas of tropical forest are used for agriculture.
This deforestation drives extinction.
In fact, we are losing species 1,000 times faster than the natural rate.
And on top of all of that bad news, one third of food produced today globally is not eaten. It's wasted.
But there is the good news, good signs.
Coalitions of stakeholders are now coming together to try to transform the food system with one shared goal: how to produce enough healthy food for everyone, at the same time, to try to cut, to sharply reduce, the footprint from the food system on the global commons.
I had an opportunity to fly over the Indonesian island of Sumatra, and I saw with my own eyes the massive deforestation to make room for palm oil plantations.
By the way, palm oil is included in thousands of food products we eat every day.
The global demand for palm oil is just increasing.
In Sumatra, I met smallholder farmers who need to make a day-to-day living from growing oil palm.
I met global food companies, financial institutions and local government officials.
All of them told me that they can't make the change by themselves, and only by working together under a kind of new contract, or a new practice, do they have a chance to protect tropical forests.
So it's so encouraging to see, at least for the last few years, this new coalition among these committed actors along the supply chain come together to try to transform the food system.
In fact, what they are trying to do is to create a new kind of social contract to manage the global commons.
All changes start at home, at your place and at my place.
At GEF, Global Environment Facility, we have now a new strategy, and we put the global commons at its center.
I hope we won't be the only ones.
If everybody stays on the sidelines, waiting for others to step in, the global commons will continue to deteriorate, and everybody will be much worse off.
We need to save ourselves from the tragedy of the commons.
So, I invite all of you to embrace the global commons.
Please do remember that global commons do exist and are waiting for your stewardship.
We all share one planet in common.
We breathe the same air, we drink the same water, we depend on the same oceans, forests, and biodiversity.
There is no space left on earth for egoism.
The global commons must be kept within their safe operating space, and we can only do it together.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
I remember my aunt brushing my hair when I was a child.
I felt this tingling in my stomach, this swelling in my belly.
All her attention on me, just me.
My beautiful Aunt Bea, stroking my hair with a fine-bristled brush.
Do you have a memory like that that you can feel in your body right now?
Before language, we're all sensation.
As children, that's how we learn to differentiate ourselves in the world -- through touch.
Everything goes in the mouth, the hands, on the skin.
Sensation -- it is the way that we first experience love.
It's the basis of human connection.
We want our children to grow up to have healthy intimate relationships.
So as parents, one of the things that we do is we teach our children about sex.
We have books to help us, we have sex ed at school for the basics.
There's porn to fill in the gaps -- and it will fill in the gaps.
(Laughter)
We teach our children "the talk" about biology and mechanics, about pregnancy and safe sex, and that's what our kids grow up thinking that sex is pretty much all about.
But we can do better than that.
We can teach our sons and daughters about pleasure and desire, about consent and boundaries, about what it feels like to be present in their body and to know when they're not.
And we do that in the ways that we model touch, play, make eye contact -- all the ways that we engage their senses.
We can teach our children not just about sex, but about sensuality.
This is the kind of talk that I needed as a girl.
I was extremely sensitive, but by the time I was an adolescent, I had numbed out.
The shame of boys mocking my changing body and then girls exiling me for, ironically, my interest in boys, it was so much.
I didn't have any language for what I was experiencing; I didn't know it was going to pass.
So I did the best thing I could at the time and I checked out.
And you can't isolate just the difficult feelings, so I lost access to the joy, the pleasure, the play, and I spent decades like that, with this his low-grade depression, thinking that this is what it meant to be a grown-up.
For the past year, I've been interviewing men and women about their relationship to sex and I've heard my story again and again.
Girls who were told they were too sensitive, too much.
Boys who were taught to man up -- "don't be so emotional." I learned I was not alone in checking out.
It was my daughter who reminded me of how much I used to feel.
We were at the beach.
It was this rare day.
I turned off my cell phone, put in the calendar, "Day at the beach with the girls." I laid our towels down just out of reach of the surf and fell asleep.
And when I woke up, I saw my daughter drizzling sand on her arm like this, and I could feel that light tickle of sand on her skin and I remembered my aunt brushing my hair.
So I curled up next to her and I drizzled sand on her other arm and then her legs.
And then I said, "Hey, you want me to bury you?" And her eyes got really big and she was like, "Yeah!" So we dug a hole and I covered her in sand and shells and drew this little mermaid tail.
And then I took her home and lathered her up in the shower and massaged her scalp and I dried her off in a towel.
And I thought, "Ah. How many times had I done that -- bathed her and dried her off -- but had I ever stopped and paid attention to the sensations that I was creating for her?" I'd been treating her like she was on some assembly line of children needing to be fed and put to bed.
And I realized that when I dry my daughter off in a towel tenderly the way a lover would, I'm teaching her to expect that kind of touch.
I'm teaching her in that moment about intimacy.
About how to love her body and respect her body.
I realized there are parts of the talk that can't be conveyed in words.
In her book, "Girls and Sex," writer Peggy Orenstein finds that young women are focusing on their partner's pleasure, not their own.
This is something I'm going to talk about with my girls when they're older, but for now, I look for ways to help them identify what gives them pleasure and to practice articulating that. "Rub my back," my daughter says when I tuck her in.
And I say, "OK, how do you want me to rub your back?" "I don't know," she says.
So I pause, waiting for her directions.
Finally she says, "OK, up and to the right, like you're tickling me." I run my fingertips up her spine. "What else?" I ask. "Over to the left, a little harder now."
We need to teach our children how to articulate their sensations so they're familiar with them.
I look for ways to play games with my girls at home to do this.
I scratch my fingernails on my daughter's arm and say, "Give me one word to describe this." "Violent," she says.
I embrace her, hold her tight. "Protected," she tells me.
I find opportunities to tell them how I'm feeling, what I'm experiencing, so we have common language.
Like right now, this tingling in my scalp down my spine means I'm nervous and I'm excited.
You are likely experiencing sensations in response to me.
The language I'm using, the ideas I'm sharing.
And our tendency is to judge these reactions and sort them into a hierarchy: better or worse, and then seek or avoid them.
And that's because we live in this binary culture and we're taught from a very young age to sort the world into good and bad. "Did you like that book?" "Did you have a good day?" How about, "What did you notice about that story?" "Tell me a moment about your day.
What did you learn?" Let's teach our children to stay open and curious about their experiences, like a traveler in a foreign land.
And that way they can stay with sensation without checking out -- even the heightened and challenging ones -- the way I did, the way so many of us have.
This sense education, this is education I want for my daughters.
Sense education is what I needed as girl.
It's what I hope for all of our children.
This awareness of sensation, it's where we began as children.
It's what we can learn from our children and it's what we can in turn remind our children as they come of age.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Let's talk about how the narrative of Africa is being told, and who is doing the telling.
I want to share with you the selection of work by contemporary artists from Africa and its diaspora.
I love this art.
I find it beautiful and inspiring and thrilling, and I really hope I am able to pique your interest.
I want to share something about myself and why art matters to me.
I'm the daughter of an artist, so that means that growing up, I had the chance to see my father do artwork in his studio.
My home was surrounded by art, and I had an early art education, being dragged to museums and exhibitions over the summer holidays.
What I did not understand, really, at the time, is that this also gave me an early understanding about why art is important, how to look at it, how to understand it, but also how to love it.
So art matters to me on a personal level, and not only because it's beautiful and inspiring and thrilling, but because art tells powerful stories.
All these artists have stories to tell you about what it means to be African, stories that tell you and touches about our African identity, but also stories that tell us about who we are as Africans, but also stories that tell us about our complex history.
So how can art tell you powerful stories?
I want to share with you this series by Senegalese artist Omar Victor Diop.
This is a series of self-portraits, and the artist in this particular series is focusing on the representation of Africans in art history between the 15th to the 19th century.
I want to show you how, with one image, Diop is able to touch on our African identity, on the politics of representation, but also on our social value system.
In this particular self-portrait, Diop is actually referencing another portrait by Anne-Louis Girodet.
This picture is doing a portrait of Jean-Baptiste Belley.
Jean-Baptiste Belley was a native of Senegal, a former slave of Haiti, but during his lifetime, he also was elected to represent the colony at the third government of the French Revolution, and he advocated strongly for the abolition of slavery.
What is very smart and clever about Diop here is that he's going back to history.
He's reclaiming this figure by restaging this beautiful royal blue uniform, where he is restaging also the pose, and he's doing that to actually underline the issues that are still impacting individuals of color today.
There was nothing special about this very typical political portrait of the time, except that for the first time, an individual of color, in that case, Jean-Baptiste Belley, was actually named and acknowledged in a painting.
What Diop is adding to this picture is this crucial element, which is the football under his arm, and by doing that, Diop is actually touching at our hero worship culture of African football stars, who unfortunately, despite their fame, their immense talent, and their royalty status, they are still invisible.
Diop is asking us to dig deeper, to go beyond history and what has been written, and, basically, see how it still influences and impacts us in the present.
I want to share this other beautiful series called "Kesh Angels," by artist Hassan Hajjaj.
So in this particular series, the artist is really pushing on the boundaries of stereotype and cliché.
Hassan Hajjaj is a friend, and honestly, I admire him dearly, but this particular series is talking to me directly as a Muslim woman.
I experience this all the time, where, you know, people have a lot of expectations, religious ones and cultural ones, but what I love about this artist is that he's putting all this on its head.
He's actually challenging every representation of Muslim, Arabic women that there is.
Hassan Hajjaj is a child of the diaspora.
He grew up in Morocco amongst bright logo goods, you know, counterfeit originals being sold at the souks.
So to see those symbols representing in his work a celebration of the global culture, a critic of the global urban culture, is no surprise, but really at the heart of his work is his desire of a nuanced representation.
He wants us to interrupt ourselves and all the perception that we might have on people, on a culture, and on environment.
And for example, this particular picture, your common association would be, you know, certain street brand for a certain Western distinctive consumer.
Well, he mashes it all up, where he is daring to imagine a female biker culture where actually Chanel or Louis Vuitton is designing the djellaba, and Nike, the babouche, and this is actually the standard uniform.
What I love about the women in "Kesh Angels" is that they are able to hold your gaze.
We are completely participating in the image, but they are the one inviting us in, and on their own terms.
Hassan Hajjaj's "Kesh Angels" or "Project Diaspora" by Omar Victor Diop offer me two strong examples why art is so instrumental. It is instrumental as it really inspires us to ask questions, but it is also instrumental because it ignites change.
Seeing diversity in race and ethnicity in contemporary art is the only way that we'll see changes in the art industry, but also for the relations between Africa and the Western canon.
How we will participate in all this is really up to us.
There's a lot of progress to be made, and honestly, we still need to support stronger voices, as they are the ones shaking things up and bringing new perspective.
I want to share this beautiful old painting by younger emerging artist Kudzanai-Violet Hwami.
For me, when I see her work, it really represents freedom.
Hwami has fantastic takes on what it means to be an African and an African life.
She has lived in three different countries: Zimbabwe, South Africa and Britain, and therefore has been influenced by a multitude of layers of communities and cultures, from LGBT to eco to Xhosa to emo to British cultures.
And as she says herself, the beauty of being a child of the diaspora is really being able to reinvent ourselves and what it means to be African.
I want to leave you with this powerful piece by South African artist Lawrence Lemaoana.
Lawrence Lemaoana also criticized the influence of the media on our moral consciousness, and he's doing that by using those fabrics like banners in political demonstrations, where he's asking us to reclaim our voices.
I believe in the transformative power of art, as it is our only way to paint a nuanced image of Africa, but also its diaspora, one that will be painted by its artists and its cultural producers with their radical but also very unique view of seeing the world and their place in it.
It is really through art that we can regain our sense of agency and empowerment.
It is through art that we can really tell our own story.
So like Lawrence Lemaoana says, the power is ours.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So many of us who care about sustainable development and the livelihood of local people do so for deeply personal reasons.
I grew up in Cameroon, a country of enchanting beauty and rich biodiversity, but plagued by poor governance, environmental destruction, and poverty. As a child, like we see with most children in sub-Saharan Africa today, I regularly suffered from malaria.
To this day, more than one million people die from malaria every year, mostly children under the age of five, with 90 percent occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.
When I was 18, I left Cameroon in search of better educational opportunities.
At the time, there was just one university in Cameroon, but Nigeria next door offered some opportunities for Cameroonians of English extraction to be trained in various fields.
So I moved there, but practicing my trade, upon graduation as an ecologist in Nigeria, was an even bigger challenge.
So I left the continent when I was offered a scholarship to Boston University for my PhD.
It is disheartening to see that, with all our challenges, with all the talents, with all the skills we have in Africa as a continent, we tend to solve our problems by parachuting in experts from the West for short stays, exporting the best and brightest out of Africa, and treating Africa as a continent in perpetual need of handouts.
After my training at Boston University, I joined a research team at the University of California's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability because of its reputation for groundbreaking research and the development of policies and programs that save the lives of millions of people the world over, including in the developing world.
And it has been shown that for every skilled African that returns home, nine new jobs are created in the formal and informal sectors.
So as part of our program, therefore, to build a sustainable Africa together, we are leading a multi-initiative to develop the Congo Basin Institute, a permanent base where Africans can work in partnership with international researchers, but working out their own solutions to their own problems.
We are using our interdisciplinary approach to show how universities, NGOs and private business can partner in international development.
So instead of parachuting in experts from the West for short stays, we are building a permanent presence in Africa, a one-stop shop for logistics, housing and development of collaborative projects between Africans and international researchers.
So this has allowed students like Michel to receive high-quality training in Africa.
Michel is currently working in our labs to investigate the effects of climate change on insects, for his PhD, and has already secured his post-doctorate fellowship that will enable him to stay on the continent.
Also through our local help program, Dr. Gbenga Abiodun, a young Nigerian scientist, can work as a post-doctoral fellow with the Foundation for Professional Development in the University of Western Cape in South Africa and the University of California at the same time, investigating the effects of climate variability and change on malaria transmission in Africa.
Indeed, Gbenga is currently developing models that will be used as an early warning system to predict malaria transmission in Africa.
So rather than exporting our best and brightest out of Africa, we are nurturing and supporting local talent in Africa.
For example, like me, Dr. Eric Fokam was trained in the US.
He returned home to Cameroon, but couldn't secure the necessary grants, and he found it incredibly challenging to practice and learn the science he knew he could.
So when I met Eric, he was on the verge of returning to the US.
But we convinced him to start collaborating with the Congo Basin Institute.
Today, his lab in Buea has over half a dozen collaborative grants with researchers from the US and Europe supporting 14 graduate students, nine of them women, all carrying out groundbreaking research understanding biodiversity under climate change, human health and nutrition.
(Applause)
So rather than buy into the ideas of Africa taking handouts, we are using our interdisciplinary approach to empower Africans to find their own solutions.
Right now, we are working with local communities and students, a US entrepreneur, scientists from the US and Africa to find a way to sustainably grow ebony, the iconic African hardwood.
Ebonies, like most African hardwood, are exploited for timber, but we know very little about their ecology, what disperses them, how they survive in our forest 80 to 200 years.
This is Arvin, a young PhD student working in our labs, conducting what is turning out to be some cutting-edge tissue culture work.
Arvin is holding in her hands the first ebony tree that was produced entirely from tissues.
This is unique in Africa.
We can now show that you can produce African timber from different plant tissues -- leaves, stems, roots -- in addition from generating them from seeds, which is a very difficult task.
(Applause)
So other students will take the varieties of ebony which Arvin identifies in our lab, graft them to produce saplings, and work with local communities to co-produce ebony with local fruit tree species in their various farms using our own tree farm approach, whereby we invite all the farmers to choose their own tree species they want in their farms.
So in addition to the ebony, the species which the farmers choose themselves will be produced using our modern techniques and incorporated into their land-use systems, so that they start benefiting from these products while waiting for the ebony to mature.
Today we are planting 15,000 ebony trees in Cameroon, and for the first time, ebony won't be harvested from the middle of a pristine forest.
This is the model for our African hardwoods, and we are extending this to include sapele and bubinga, other highly prized hardwoods.
So if these examples existed when I was 18, I would never have left, but because of initiatives by the Congo Basin Institute, I am coming back, but I'm not coming back alone.
I'm bringing with me Western scientists, entrepreneurs and students, the best science from the best universities in the world, to work and to live in Africa.
But we all need to scale up this local, powerful and empowering approach. So far we have half a dozen universities and NGOs as partners.
We are planning to build a green facility that will expand on our existing laboratory space and add more housing and conference facilities to promote a long-term disciplinary approach.
I want it to offer more opportunities to young African scholars, and would scale it up by leveraging the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture's existing network of 17 research stations across sub-Saharan Africa.
The tables are starting to turn ... and I hope they keep turning, to reach several African nations like Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Senegal, among the top fastest growing economies that can attract several opportunities for private-sector investment.
We want to give more opportunities to African scholars, and I long to see a day when the most intelligent Africans will stay on this continent and receive high-quality education through initiatives like the Congo Basin Institute, and when that happens, Africa will be on the way to solving Africa's problems.
And in 50 years, I hope someone will be giving a TED Talk on how to stop the brain drain of Westerners leaving your homes to work and live in Africa.
(Applause)
Thank you.
By the year 2050, the population of Africa will have doubled.
One in four people on Earth will be African at that point, and this is both really exciting and daunting all at once.
It's really exciting because, for the first time in the modern era, there will be enough Africans on the Earth to bully everybody else.
(Laughter)
I'm only kidding.
But it's daunting, because we're going to have to have economies that can sustain this population growth, and many of the people are going to be very young.
Now most of governments in Africa have a plan for this economic growth -- in Kenya, we call ours Vision2030 -- and they're all predicated on industrialization.
The thing is, though, that the world is going through the Fourth Industrial Revolution right now, which means that there's a merger of the physical, cyber, and biological worlds.
It means that because of massive interconnectivity and the availability of artificial intelligence and robotics, many of the jobs that we know and are used to right now won't exist in the future.
So the challenge is a lot greater, in many ways, than it even was when Asia was industrializing, for example.
To add to this, one of the kinds of person that you need for industrialization is an engineer, and they're really in short supply on the continent.
If you compare, for example, the number of engineers that those same Asian countries had a couple of decades ago when they were industrializing, we fall far short.
And I've taught for a while, and many of the students who are studying engineering end up actually working in auditing firms and banks, and many of them spend half their time doing accounting and so on as they're preparing.
Now, I was fortunate enough to do my undergrad and postgrad education in the UK and the US, in countries, environments, where there was all the equipment that you required, all the sophistication in the systems, and then I worked for about three years in Japan doing R & amp; D for a large firm.
And so I was very used to having good equipment, and went back home and joined the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Nairobi, wanting to contribute and be on the continent.
And I quickly found I was really quite useless, because there wasn't all the equipment that I had become accustomed to available.
And I was teaching students who I would find very bright ideas in their minds and they'd be presenting things that I knew if only we had sufficient equipment, they'd be able to really contribute to the challenge of industrialization.
So I kind of had to change hats, and became quite entrepreneurial and started looking for money to buy the equipment that we required.
And I heard about a concept out of MIT, called the Fab Labs.
These are digital fabrication labs that allow, in a rather small space with not very expensive equipment, people to have access to these tools to be able to make almost anything, as the slogan goes.
And so I was able to convince a government official to buy one of these for the university where I was teaching.
And immediately, we had wonderful results.
We saw all kinds of innovations coming through, and for the first time in this context at the university, engineering students from different disciplines were doing the lab and practical exercises together in the same space.
Normally, they'd be siloed.
And not just that, but students who weren't engineers at all were also working in the same place, and non-students, people who had nothing to do with the university, were also coming into this space.
So you had this rich mix of people, people who think differently from one another, and this always is really good for innovation.
I was really proud of what we were seeing.
So you can imagine my surprise when one day the dean of engineering came and said to me, "Kamau, the students who spend most of the time in the Fab Lab are failing their exams." I said, "What do you mean?" And I looked into it, and he was right, and the reason they were failing is that they'd honed their skills so well in certain things that they were going out into the city and offering services for money.
So they were making money --
(Laughter)
and they therefore weren't focusing on their studies.
And I thought, what a good problem to have.
(Laughter)
Don't quote me on that. I'm an academician.
So we needed to scale this, and at the university, things were a bit too bureaucratic, and so I moved out and I hooked up with people who, in Nairobi, were providing spaces for IT experts to share fast internet and things like that.
And some of these places are really quite famous.
They've made Kenya famous for IT.
And together we set up a space which we are setting up right now.
We've moved from where we were. We are in a much larger space, and we're sort of making available a wide range of equipment, including the digital fabrication tools that I mentioned, and analog tools, to anybody really, on a membership basis.
It's a bit like a gym, so you come in, you pay, you get taught how to use the equipment, and then you're set free to innovate and do whatever it is that you want, and you don't have to be an engineer, necessarily.
And some of the people in the space are setting up a small company.
They just need a space at a desk, and so we provide that at a fee, and others take up bigger spaces and are able to set up their offices.
They're further along.
Maybe their company has been running for a certain period of time.
And so we're able to accommodate all of this in an innovation space that is really quite active.
What you're seeing in this image over here is Douglas, and Douglas is an electrical engineer, one of the people who was really active in the Fab Lab.
I'm pretty sure he passed his exams.
And the image on the top left is a copper sheet.
And he designed a circuit that the client came to him and said, "I need this circuit for a pay-as-you-go system." And so this is a model for business that's made accessibility to goods and services for very poor people really much easier, because they're able to pay a little bit, like a dollar a day, for example, for a specific service.
And so this company wanted to pilot a new idea that they had, and so they just needed 50 circuits, so they hired him to make them, and what you're seeing him doing there is, he's able to design on the computer what the circuit will be and then transfer it to an etching process -- that's the image on the top right -- and then populate the board using this robot.
And so what would normally take him maybe a day or something to solder by hand, he can do in a few minutes using this machine.
So he was able to complete the entire order within Gearbox, and this is really important, because if it wasn't for what we provided right now, he would have had to have hired a company in China to do this, and because it's such a small order, it would have taken a long time.
It would be a small company, because big companies wouldn't take small orders, and even then, if they got a bigger order, they'd bump him off in favor of that.
And there's language problems and so on, so being able to do it in country is really very important, and of course piloting as a phase within the progress of the business idea is extremely important, because you can go back and make corrections and so on.
In this image — Thank you.
In this image you see on the top left, what you're looking at is a 3D render of a digital fabrication machine. In this instance, it doubles as a plasma cutter and also a wood router.
And so the plasma cutter makes possible the cutting of plate and sheet metal, and basically, you make a design on the computer and send it over to the machine, and then quickly and precisely, it will cut the shapes you want.
But in this machine, you can also change the plasma cutter and put on a spindle, and then you can carve wood as well.
So this was designed by my Head of Engineering.
His name is Wachira, and when I hired him about two years ago, I asked him, "Just give me two years, and by the time you've trained a lot of people so that we have good staff under you, then you can move out and become a good story for us." And that's exactly what's just happened.
He's got two types of customers.
The higher-tier customer is a company that's actually using his machine to cut sheet metal for Isuzu truck fabrication in Nairobi, which is being done by General Motors.
So we're really proud to be able to say that we have an original equipment manufacturer in Nairobi that's provided what's effectively an industrial robot to supply parts for General Motors.
Now this is really important --
(Applause)
and it's really important because the population growth being what it is, a lot of very large companies are looking very closely at the market that's developing in Africa.
So in Kenya right now, we have Volkswagen, Peugeot, Renault, we have Mercedes doing lorries, and we've also got Toyota, they've been there a long time.
And these are all manufacturers planning to assemble vehicles and in the future, to manufacture in the country.
Many of them are planning to train lots of people that they'd hire, and that's really important for the economy, but when the magic really happens, when these companies begin to buy their parts for the vehicles from local companies, so supply chain development is something that's very important for us to be able to pivot and to have very productive economies, and that's something we're focused on at our space.
This other image shows another class of customer that he has.
On the top left, you have these people who are actually using very crude tools to work metal and wood.
And Kenya has a population of about 44 million people.
The work force is about 13 million, and about 80 to 90 percent of those are in the informal sector.
And what you're seeing in the image at the top left over there is very typical of semi-skilled artisans who are making products for the marketplace that are really crude.
Their production rate is very slow.
The quality of the product isn't high.
And so we've teamed Wachira up with a bank, and the bank is paying him to train people from this sector on how to use this industrial robot.
And the result is that some of them are going to be able to get loans to buy the machine for themselves.
Others will be able to go to centers where they can carry their material, get the design done, and take the materials back that have been made really, really fast and assemble them in their own spaces.
So somebody making a gate, for example, out of metal, may take a week to make just one gate, but with this machine, they might make 10 in a day.
So the productivity of a large swathe of our population should be able to jump by a quantum amount, quite significantly, because of this kind of machine.
And that's what we're at the beginning of, so this is really very exciting.
This is another person who uses our space.
Her name is Esther.
She's in her mid-20s, and she came in very passionate about a problem that she explained.
She said that schools days are missed every month by young girls because of their menstrual cycle, and they're not able to buy a sanitary towel.
And the reason that she described was that the manufacturers packaged these in bundles of seven to 10, and breaking it down is unhygienic at the retail level, and packaging each one of them is too expensive.
So she thought up an idea, which is brilliant, and simple.
Why don't we just use vending machines?
And she, in a very clean environment, can break down the bundles and fill up the vending machines, and then girls can buy these sanitary towels in the privacy of a toilet, in a public space, in a school, and so on. She was able to pilot this and it worked really very well, and she's been able to sort of get the bugs out and so on.
So the significance here is that the piloting process is possible.
She's not an engineer.
She was able to engage people in our space to be able to help her to do this, and she's off and running now with a business accelerator, so we expect to see great results.
(Applause)
In this image you're looking at -- the result of a master's project that was done at University of Nairobi by Tony Nyagah, an engineering student, and he just integrated a solar cell into a roof tile and decided to make it a business.
He joined up with his sister who is an architect, and they have this business, and they present the roof tile to a person who is doing development and say, "You can buy it for the cost of just the roof tile without the solar." So they're giving it at a discount, and then they'll build them using the internet of things over time, they'll pay about a third of the utility charges for the electricity and they can sell the excess back to the grid.
And so they'll make their money over time, and they've been able to do quite a few installments.
We were very proud to be able to show this to somebody kind of famous, as you can see there, and this other famous guy actually presented the same idea, but as far as we're concerned, if it was after us, so --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So in closing, going forward, of course being able to prototype and do low manufacturing in this kind of a setting is very important for the industrialization process, but we're also taking advantage of a lot of new ways of doing things: the open source movement, distributive manufacturing, circular production.
So it's all very important for not just industrializing and being able to meet people's needs, but also making sure that the environment is taken care of.
We're also really interested in culture.
We have lots of discussions in our space around who we were as Africans, who we are today, and who we want to be vis-à-vis things like consumerism and ethnicity and corruption and so on.
So we see ourselves as providing, adding value to people by teaching them to add value to things or materials so that they can build things that matter.
Thank you very much for your attention.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I would like to begin with a little experiment.
In a moment, I'm going to ask if you would close your eyes and see if you can work out what emotions you're feeling right now.
Now, you're not going to tell anyone or anything.
The idea is to see how easy or perhaps hard you find it to pinpoint exactly what you're feeling.
And I thought I'd give you 10 seconds to do this.
OK?
Right, let's start.
OK, that's it, time's up.
How did it go?
You were probably feeling a little bit under pressure, maybe suspicious of the person next to you.
Did they definitely have their eyes closed?
Perhaps you felt some strange, distant worry about that email you sent this morning or excitement about something you've got planned for this evening.
Maybe you felt that exhilaration that comes when we get together in big groups of people like this; the Welsh called it "hwyl," from the word for boat sails.
Or maybe you felt all of these things.
There are some emotions which wash the world in a single color, like the terror felt as a car skids.
But more often, our emotions crowd and jostle together until it is actually quite hard to tell them apart.
Some slide past so quickly you'd hardly even notice them, like the nostalgia that will make you reach out to grab a familiar brand in the supermarket.
And then there are others that we hurry away from, fearing that they'll burst on us, like the jealousy that causes you to search a loved one's pockets.
And of course, there are some emotions which are so peculiar, you might not even know what to call them.
Perhaps sitting there, you had a little tingle of a desire for an emotion one eminent French sociologist called "ilinx," the delirium that comes with minor acts of chaos.
For example, if you stood up right now and emptied the contents of your bag all over the floor.
Perhaps you experienced one of those odd, untranslatable emotions for which there's no obvious English equivalent.
You might have felt the feeling the Dutch called "gezelligheid," being cozy and warm inside with friends when it's cold and damp outside.
Maybe if you were really lucky, you felt this: "basorexia," a sudden urge to kiss someone.
(Laughter)
We live in an age when knowledge of emotions is an extremely important commodity, where emotions are used to explain many things, exploited by our politicians, manipulated by algorithms.
Emotional intelligence, which is the skill of being able to recognize and name your own emotions and those of other people, is considered so important, that this is taught in our schools and businesses and encouraged by our health services.
But despite all of this, I sometimes wonder if the way we think about emotions is becoming impoverished.
Sometimes, we're not even that clear what an emotion even is.
You've probably heard the theory that our entire emotional lives can be boiled down to a handful of basic emotions.
This idea is actually about 2,000 years old, but in our own time, some evolutionary psychologists have suggested that these six emotions -- happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, surprise -- are expressed by everyone across the globe in exactly the same way, and therefore represent the building blocks of our entire emotional lives.
Well, if you look at an emotion like this, then it looks like a simple reflex: it's triggered by an external predicament, it's hardwired, it's there to protect us from harm.
So you see a bear, your heart rate quickens, your pupils dilate, you feel frightened, you run very, very fast.
The problem with this picture is, it doesn't entirely capture what an emotion is.
Of course, the physiology is extremely important, but it's not the only reason why we feel the way we do at any given moment.
What if I was to tell you that in the 12th century, some troubadours didn't see yawning as caused by tiredness or boredom like we do today, but thought it a symbol of the deepest love?
Or that in that same period, brave men -- knights -- commonly fainted out of dismay?
What if I was to tell you that some early Christians who lived in the desert believed that flying demons who mainly came out at lunchtime could infect them with an emotion they called "accidie," a kind of lethargy that was sometimes so intense it could even kill them?
Or that boredom, as we know and love it today, was first really only felt by the Victorians, in response to new ideas about leisure time and self-improvement?
What if we were to think again about those odd, untranslatable words for emotions and wonder whether some cultures might feel an emotion more intensely just because they've bothered to name and talk about it, like the Russian "toska," a feeling of maddening dissatisfaction said to blow in from the great plains.
The most recent developments in cognitive science show that emotions are not simple reflexes, but immensely complex, elastic systems that respond both to the biologies that we've inherited and to the cultures that we live in now.
They are cognitive phenomena.
They're shaped not just by our bodies, but by our thoughts, our concepts, our language.
The neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett has become very interested in this dynamic relationship between words and emotions.
She argues that when we learn a new word for an emotion, new feelings are sure to follow.
As a historian, I've long suspected that as language changes, our emotions do, too.
When we look to the past, it's easy to see that emotions have changed, sometimes very dramatically, in response to new cultural expectations and religious beliefs, new ideas about gender, ethnicity and age, even in response to new political and economic ideologies.
There is a historicity to emotions that we are only recently starting to understand.
So I agree absolutely that it does us good to learn new words for emotions, but I think we need to go further.
I think to be truly emotionally intelligent, we need to understand where those words have come from, and what ideas about how we ought to live and behave they are smuggling along with them.
Let me tell you a story.
It begins in a garret in the late 17th century, in the Swiss university town of Basel.
Inside, there's a dedicated student living some 60 miles away from home.
He stops turning up to his lectures, and his friends come to visit and they find him dejected and feverish, having heart palpitations, strange sores breaking out on his body.
Doctors are called, and they think it's so serious that prayers are said for him in the local church.
And it's only when they're preparing to return this young man home so that he can die, that they realize what's going on, because once they lift him onto the stretcher, his breathing becomes less labored.
And by the time he's got to the gates of his hometown, he's almost entirely recovered.
And that's when they realize that he's been suffering from a very powerful form of homesickness.
It's so powerful, that it might have killed him.
Well, in 1688, a young doctor, Johannes Hofer, heard of this case and others like it and christened the illness "nostalgia." The diagnosis quickly caught on in medical circles around Europe.
The English actually thought they were probably immune because of all the travel they did in the empire and so on.
But soon there were cases cropping up in Britain, too.
The last person to die from nostalgia was an American soldier fighting during the First World War in France.
How is it possible that you could die from nostalgia less than a hundred years ago?
But today, not only does the word mean something different -- a sickening for a lost time rather than a lost place -- but homesickness itself is seen as less serious, sort of downgraded from something you could die from to something you're mainly worried your kid might be suffering from at a sleepover.
This change seems to have happened in the early 20th century. But why? Was it the invention of telephones or the expansion of the railways?
Was it perhaps the coming of modernity, with its celebration of restlessness and travel and progress that made sickening for the familiar seem rather unambitious?
You and I inherit that massive transformation in values, and it's one reason why we might not feel homesickness today as acutely as we used to.
It's important to understand that these large historical changes influence our emotions partly because they affect how we feel about how we feel.
Today, we celebrate happiness.
Happiness is supposed to make us better workers and parents and partners; it's supposed to make us live longer.
In the 16th century, sadness was thought to do most of those things.
It's even possible to read self-help books from that period which try to encourage sadness in readers by giving them lists of reasons to be disappointed.
(Laughter)
These self-help authors thought you could cultivate sadness as a skill, since being expert in it would make you more resilient when something bad did happen to you, as invariably it would.
I think we could learn from this today.
Feel sad today, and you might feel impatient, even a little ashamed.
Feel sad in the 16th century, and you might feel a little bit smug.
Of course, our emotions don't just change across time, they also change from place to place.
The Baining people of Papua New Guinea speak of "awumbuk," a feeling of lethargy that descends when a houseguest finally leaves.
(Laughter)
Now, you or I might feel relief, but in Baining culture, departing guests are thought to shed a sort of heaviness so they can travel more easily, and this heaviness infects the air and causes this awumbuk.
And so what they do is leave a bowl of water out overnight to absorb this air, and then very early the next morning, they wake up and have a ceremony and throw the water away.
Now, here's a good example of spiritual practices and geographical realities combining to bring a distinct emotion into life and make it disappear again.
One of my favorite emotions is a Japanese word, "amae." Amae is a very common word in Japan, but it is actually quite hard to translate.
It means something like the pleasure that you get when you're able to temporarily hand over responsibility for your life to someone else.
(Laughter)
Now, anthropologists suggest that one reason why this word might have been named and celebrated in Japan is because of that country's traditionally collectivist culture, whereas the feeling of dependency may be more fraught amongst English speakers, who have learned to value self-sufficiency and individualism.
This might be a little simplistic, but it is tantalizing.
What might our emotional languages tell us not just about what we feel, but about what we value most?
Most people who tell us to pay attention to our well-being talk of the importance of naming our emotions.
But these names aren't neutral labels.
They are freighted with our culture's values and expectations, and they transmit ideas about who we think we are.
Learning new and unusual words for emotions will help attune us to the more finely grained aspects of our inner lives.
But more than this, I think these words are worth caring about, because they remind us how powerful the connection is between what we think and how we end up feeling.
True emotional intelligence requires that we understand the social, the political, the cultural forces that have shaped what we've come to believe about our emotions and understand how happiness or hatred or love or anger might still be changing now.
Because if we want to measure our emotions and teach them in our schools and listen as our politicians tell us how important they are, then it is a good idea that we understand where the assumptions we have about them have come from, and whether they still truly speak to us now.
I want to end with an emotion I often feel when I'm working as a historian.
It's a French word, "dépaysement." It evokes the giddy disorientation that you feel in an unfamiliar place.
One of my favorite parts of being a historian is when something I've completely taken for granted, some very familiar part of my life, is suddenly made strange again.
Dépaysement is unsettling, but it's exciting, too.
And I hope you might be having just a little glimpse of it right now.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My journey away from violent extremism began 22 years ago, when I denounced racism and left the American white supremacist skinhead movement that I had helped build.
(Cheers and applause)
I was just 22 years old at the time, but I had already spent eight years, from the time I was 14 years old, as one of the earliest and youngest members and an eventual leader within America's most violent hate movement.
But I wasn't born into hate; in fact, it was quite the opposite.
I had a relatively normal childhood.
My parents are Italian immigrants who came to the United States in the mid-1960s and settled on the South Side of Chicago, where they eventually met, and opened a small beauty shop.
Right after I was born, things got a little bit more difficult.
They struggled to survive with raising a young family and a new business, often working seven days a week, 14 hours a day, taking on second and third jobs just to earn a meager living.
And quality time with my parents was pretty nonexistent.
Even though I knew they loved me very much, growing up, I felt abandoned.
I was lonely, and I started to withdraw, and then I started to resent my parents and become very angry.
And as I was growing up, through my teenage years, I started to act out to try and get attention from my parents.
And one day, when I was 14, I was standing in an alley, and I was smoking a joint, and a man who was twice my age, with a shaved head and tall black boots, came up to me, and he snatched the joint from my lips. Then he put his hand on my shoulder and he looked me in the eyes, and he said, "That's what the communists and the Jews want you to do to keep you docile." I was 14 years old, I'd been trading baseball cards and watching "Happy Days" — I didn't really know what a Jew was.
(Laughter)
It's true. And the only communist that I knew was the bad Russian guy in my favorite Rocky movie.
(Laughter)
And since I'm here baring my soul with you, I can reveal that I did not even know what the word "docile" meant.
(Laughter)
Dead serious.
But it was as if this man in this alley had offered me a lifeline.
For 14 years, I'd felt marginalized and bullied.
I had low self-esteem.
And frankly, I didn't know who I was, where I belonged, or what my purpose was. I was lost. And overnight, because this man had pulled me in, and I had grabbed onto that lifeline with every fiber of my being.
I had gone from "Joanie Loves Chachi" to full-blown Nazi. Overnight.
I started to listen to the rhetoric and believe it.
I started to watch very closely as the leaders of this organization would target vulnerable young people who felt marginalized and then draw them in with promises of paradise that were broken.
And then I started to recruit myself.
I started to do that by making white-power music.
And soon, I became the leader of that infamous organization that was led by that man in that alley who recruited me that day, who was America's first neo-Nazi skinhead and who had radicalized me.
For the next eight years, I believed the lies that I had been fed.
And though I saw no evidence of it whatsoever, I didn't hesitate to blame every Jewish person in the world for what I thought was a white, European genocide being promoted by them through a multiculturalist agenda.
I blamed people of color for the crime and violence and the drugs in the city, completely neglecting the fact that I was committing acts of violence on a daily basis, and that in many cases, it was white supremacists who were funneling drugs into the inner cities.
And I blamed immigrants for taking jobs from white Americans, completely neglecting the fact that my parents were hardworking immigrants who struggled to survive, despite not getting help from anybody else.
For the next eight years, I saw friends die, I saw others go to prison and inflict untold pain on countless victims and their families' lives.
I heard horrific stories from young women in the movement, who'd been brutally raped by the very men they were conditioned to trust, and I myself committed acts of violence against people, solely for the color of their skin, who they loved, or the god that they prayed to.
I stockpiled weapons for what I thought was an upcoming race war.
I went to six high schools; I was kicked out of four of them, one of them, twice.
And 25 years ago, I wrote and performed racist music that found its way to the internet decades later and partially inspired a young white nationalist to walk into a sacred Charleston, South Carolina, church and senselessly massacre nine innocent people.
But then my life changed.
At 19 years old, I met a girl who was not in the movement, who didn't have a racist bone in her body, and I fell in love with her.
And at 19, we got married, and we had our first son.
And when I held my son in my arms in the delivery room that day, not only did I reconnect with some of the innocence that I had lost at 14 years old, but it also began to challenge the very important things that drew me to the movement to begin with: identity, community and purpose -- things that I had been struggling with as a young boy.
And now, I struggled with the concept of who I was again.
Was I this neo-Nazi hatemonger, or was I a caring father and husband?
Was my community the one that I had manufactured around me to boost my own ego, because I felt self-hatred for myself and I wanted to project it onto others, or was it the one that I had physically given life to?
Was my purpose to scorch the earth or was it to make it a better place for my family?
And suddenly, like a ton of bricks hit me, I became very confused with who I'd been for the last eight years.
And if only I'd been brave enough to walk away at that moment, to understand what the struggle was that was happening inside of me, then maybe tragedy could have been averted.
Instead, I did compromise.
I took myself off the streets for the benefit of my family, because I was nervous that maybe I could go to jail or end up dead, and they would have to fend for themselves.
So I stepped back as a leader, and instead I opened a record store that I was going to sell white-power music in, of course, because I was importing it in from Europe.
But I knew that if I was just a racist store selling racist music the community would not allow me to be there.
So I decided I was going to also stock the shelves with other music, like punk rock and heavy metal and hip-hop.
And while the white-power music that I was selling was 75 percent of my gross revenue, because people were driving in from all over the country to buy it from the only store that was selling it, I also had customers come in to buy the other music.
And eventually, they started to talk to me.
One day, a young black teen came in, and he was visibly upset.
And I decided to ask him what was wrong.
And he told me that his mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer.
And suddenly, this young black teenager, who I'd never had a meaningful conversation or interaction with, I was able to connect with, because my own mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer, and I could feel his pain.
On another occasion, a gay couple came in with their son, and it was undeniable to me that they loved their son in the same profound ways that I loved mine.
And suddenly, I couldn't rationalize or justify the prejudice that I had in my head.
I decided to pull the white-power music from the inventory when I became too embarrassed to sell it in front of my new friends.
And of course, the store couldn't sustain itself, so I had to close it.
At that same time, I lost nearly everything in my life.
I used it as an opportunity to walk away from the movement that I'd been a part of for eight years, the only identity, community and purpose that I'd really known for most of my life.
So I had nobody.
I lost my livelihood because I closed the store.
I didn't have a great relationship with my parents, even though they tried.
And my wife and children left me, because I hadn't left the movement and disengaged quickly enough.
And suddenly, I didn't know who I was again, or where I fit in or what my purpose was supposed to be.
I was miserable inside, and I often woke up in the morning wishing that I hadn't.
About five years in, one of the few friends that I had was concerned about my well-being, and she came to me and she said, "You need to do something, because I don't want to see you die." And she suggested that I go apply for a job where she worked, at a company called IBM.
Yeah, I thought she was crazy, too.
(Laughter)
Here I was, a closeted ex-Nazi covered in hate tattoos.
I didn't go to college.
I'd been kicked out of multiple high schools multiple times.
I didn't even own a computer.
But I went in, and somehow, miraculously, I got the job. I was thrilled.
And then I became terrified to learn that they'd actually be putting me back at my old high school, the same one I got kicked out of twice, to install their computers.
This was a high school where I had committed acts of violence against students, against faculty; where I had protested out in front of the school for equal rights for whites and even had a sit-in in the cafeteria to try and demand a white student union.
And of course, as karma would have it, within the first couple of hours, who walks right by me but Mr. Johnny Holmes, the tough black security guard I had gotten in a fistfight with, that got me kicked out the second time and led out in handcuffs from the school.
He didn't recognize me, but I saw him, and I didn't know what to do.
I was frozen; I was this grown man now, years out of the movement, and I was sweating and I was trembling.
But I decided I had to do something.
And I decided I needed to suffer under the weight of my past, because for five years I had tried to outrun it.
I'd tried to make new friends and cover my tattoos with long sleeves, and I wouldn't admit it because I was afraid of being judged the same way I had judged other people.
Well, I decided I was going to chase Mr. Holmes out to the parking lot -- probably not the smartest decision that I made.
(Laughter)
But when I found him, he was getting into his car, and I tapped him on the shoulder.
And when he turned around and he recognized me, he took a step back because he was afraid.
And I didn't know what to say.
Finally, the words came out of my mouth, and all I could think to say was, "I'm sorry." And he embraced me, and he forgave me.
And he encouraged me to forgive myself.
He recognized that it wasn't the story of some broken go-nowhere kid who was going to just join a gang and go to prison.
He knew that this was the story of every young person who was vulnerable, who was searching for identity, community and purpose, and then hit a wall and was unable to find it and went down a dark path.
And he made me promise one thing, that I would tell my story to whoever would listen.
That was 18 years ago, and I've been doing it ever since.
(Applause)
You might be asking yourself right now: How does a good kid from a hard working immigrant family end up going down such a dark path?
One word: potholes. That's right. Potholes. I had a lot of potholes when I was kid.
We all had them -- you know, the things in life that we hit that invariably just kind of nudge us off our path, and if they remain unresolved or untreated or not dealt with, sometimes we can get dangerously lost down pretty dark corridors.
Potholes can be things like trauma, abuse, unemployment, neglect, untreated mental health conditions, even privilege.
And if we hit enough potholes on our journey in life, and we don't have the resources or the help to navigate around them or to pull us out, well, sometimes good people end up doing bad things.
One such person who had potholes is Darrell.
Darrell is from upstate New York.
He had read my memoir, and he was really upset about the ending.
You see, I'd gotten out of the movement and he was still in.
And he emailed me and he said, "I didn't really like the way that turned out." And I said, "Well, I'm sorry."
(Laughter)
"But if you want to talk about it, we could certainly do that."
And after a couple of weeks of going back and forth with Darrell, I learned he was a 31-year-old military veteran who had been injured and was really angry about not being able to go to Afghanistan to kill Muslims.
And one day on the phone, he told me that he had seen a Muslim man in the park praying, and that all he wanted to do was kick him in the face.
I flew to Buffalo the next day, and I sat down with Darrell, and I asked him, "Have you ever met a Muslim person before?" And he said, "No! Why the hell would I want to do that? They're evil. I don't want anything to do with them." I said, "OK." So I excused myself, and I went into the bathroom and I took my phone out in the bathroom, and I Googled the local mosque, and I called them very quietly from the bathroom, and I said, "Excuse me, imam, I need a favor.
I have a Christian man who would really love to learn more about your religion."
(Laughter)
"Do you mind if we stop by?"
Well, it took some convincing for Darrell to go, but finally we got there, and when I knocked on the door, the imam said he only had 15 minutes left for us, because he was preparing for a prayer service.
I said, "We'll take it." We went in, and two and a half hours later, we came out after hugging and crying and, very strangely, bonding over Chuck Norris for some reason.
(Laughter)
I don't know what it was about that, but that's what happened.
And I'm happy to say now that Darrell and the imam, you can often find them at the local falafel stand, having lunch together.
(Applause)
You see, it's our disconnection from each other.
Hatred is born of ignorance.
Fear is its father, and isolation is its mother.
When we don't understand something, we tend to be afraid of it, and if we keep ourselves from it, that fear grows, and sometimes, it turns into hatred.
Since I've left the movement, I've helped over a hundred people disengage from extremist movements, from white supremacist groups --
(Applause)
to even jihadist groups. And the way I do that is not by arguing with them, not by debating them, not by even telling them they're wrong, even though, boy, I want to sometimes.
I don't do that.
Instead, I don't push them away.
I draw them in closer, and I listen very closely for their potholes, and then I begin to fill them in.
I try to make people more resilient, more self-confident, more able to have skills to compete in the marketplace so that they don't have to blame the other, the other that they've never met.
I'd like to just leave you with one last thing before I go.
Of all the people I've worked with, they will all tell you the same thing.
One, they became extremists because they wanted to belong, not because of ideology or dogma.
And second, what brought them out was receiving compassion from the people they least deserved it from, when they least deserved it.
(Applause)
So I would like to leave you with a challenge: go out there today, tomorrow -- hopefully every day -- find somebody that you think is undeserving of your compassion and give it to them, because I guarantee you, they're the ones who need it the most.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Like every passionate software engineer out there, I closely follow technology companies in Silicon Valley, pretty much the same way soccer fans follow their teams in Europe.
I read articles on tech blogs and listen to podcasts on my phone.
But after I finish the article, lock my phone and unplug the headphones, I'm back in sub-Saharan Africa, where the landscape is not quite the same.
We have long and frequent power outages, low penetration of computers, slow internet connections and a lot of patients visiting understaffed hospitals.
Since the HIV epidemic, hospitals have been struggling to manage regular HIV treatment records for increasing volumes of patients.
For such environments, importing technology systems developed elsewhere has not worked, but in 2006, I joined Baobab Health, a team that uses locally based engineers to develop suitable interventions that are addressing health care challenges in Malawi.
We designed an electronic health record system that is used by health care workers while seeing patients.
And in the process we realized that we not only had to design the software, we had to implement the infrastructure as well.
We don't have enough medical staff to comprehensively examine every patient, so we embedded clinical guidelines within the software to guide nurses and clerks who assist with handling some of the workload.
Everyone has a birthday, but not everyone knows their birthday, so we wrote algorithms to handle estimated birthdates as complete dates.
How do we follow up patients living in slums with no street and house numbers?
We used landmarks to approximate their physical addresses.
Malawi had no IDs to uniquely identify patients, so we had to implement unique patient IDs to link patient records across clinics.
The IDs are printed as barcodes on labels that are stuck on personal health booklets kept by each patient.
With this barcoded ID, a simple scan with a barcode reader quickly pulls up the patient's records.
No need to rewrite their personal details on paper registers at every visit.
And suddenly, queues became shorter.
This meant patients, typically mothers with little children on their backs, had to spend less time waiting to be assisted.
And if they lose their booklets, their records can still be pulled by searching with their names.
Now, the way we pronounce and spell names varies tremendously.
We freely mix R's and L's, English and vernacular versions of their names.
Even soundex, a standard method for grouping words by how similar they sound, was not good enough.
So we had to modify it to help us link and match existing records.
Before the iPhone, software engineers developed for personal computers, but from our experience, we knew our power system is not reliable enough for personal computers.
So we repurposed touch screen point-of-sale terminals that are meant for retail shops to become clinical workstations.
At the time, we imported internet appliances called i-Openers that were manufactured during the dot-com era by a failed US company.
We modified their screens to add touch sensors and their power system to run from rechargeable batteries.
When we started, we didn't find a reliable network to transmit data, especially from rural hospitals.
So we built our own towers, created a wireless network and linked clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi's capital.
(Applause)
With a team of engineers working within a hospital campus, we observed health care workers use the system and iteratively build an information system that is now managing HIV records in all major public hospitals in Malawi.
These are hospitals serving over 2,000 HIV patients, each clinic.
Now, health care workers who used to spend days to tally and prepare quarterly reports are producing the same reports within minutes, and health care experts from all over the world are now coming to Malawi to learn how we did it.
It is inspiring and fun to follow technology trends across the globe, but to make them work in low-resourced environments like public hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, we have had to become jacks-of-all-trades and build whole systems, including the infrastructure, from the ground up.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In March 2017, the mayor of Cape Town officially declared Cape Town a local disaster, as it had less than four months left of usable water.
Residents were restricted to 100 liters of water per person, per day.
But what does that really mean?
With 100 liters of water per day, you can take a five-minute shower, wash your face twice and probably flush the toilet about five times.
You still didn't brush your teeth, you didn't do laundry, and you definitely didn't water your plants.
You, unfortunately, didn't wash your hands after those five toilet flushes.
And you didn't even take a sip of water.
The mayor described this as that it means a new relationship with water.
Today, seven months later, I can share two things about my second home with you.
First: Cape Town hasn't run out of water just yet.
But as of September 3rd, the hundred-liter limit dropped to 87 liters.
The mayor defined the city's new normal as one of permanent drought.
Second: what's happening in Cape Town is pretty much coming to many other cities and countries in the world.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, excluding countries that we don't have data for, less than five percent of the world's population is living in a country that has more water today than it did 20 years ago.
Everyone else is living in a country that has less water today.
And nearly one out of three are living in a country that is facing a water crisis.
I grew up in Jordan, a water-poor country that has experienced absolute water scarcity since 1973.
And still, in 2017, only 10 countries in the world have less water than Jordan.
So dealing with a lack of water is quite ingrained in my soul.
As soon as I was old enough to learn how to write my name, I also learned that I need to conserve water.
My parents would constantly remind my siblings and I to close the tap when we brushed our teeth.
We used to fill balloons with flour instead of water when we played.
It's just as much fun, though.
(Laughter)
And a few years ago, when my friends and I were dared to do the Ice Bucket Challenge, we did that with sand.
(Laughter)
And you might think that, you know, that's easy, sand is not ice cold.
I promise you, sand goes everywhere, and it took ages to get rid of it.
But what perhaps I didn't realize as I played with flour balloons as a child, and as I poured sand on my head as an adult, is that some of the techniques that seem second nature to me and to others who live in dry countries might help us all address what is fast becoming a global crisis.
I wish to share three lessons today, three lessons from water-poor countries and how they survived and even thrived despite their water crisis.
Lesson one: tell people how much water they really have.
In order to solve a problem, we need to acknowledge that we have one.
And when it comes to water, people can easily turn a blind eye, pretending that since water is coming out of the tap now, everything will be fine forever.
But some smart, drought-affected countries have adopted simple, innovative measures to make sure their citizens, their communities and their companies know just how dry their countries are.
When I was in Cape Town earlier this year, I saw this electronic billboard on the freeway, indicating how much water the city had left.
This is an idea they may well have borrowed from Australia when it faced one of the worst droughts of the country's history from 1997 to 2009.
Water levels in Melbourne dropped to a very low capacity of almost 26 percent.
But the city didn't yell at people.
It didn't plead with them not to use water.
They used electronic billboards to flash available levels of water to all citizens across the city.
They were honestly telling people how much water they really have, and letting them take responsibility for themselves.
By the end of the drought, this created such a sense of urgency as well as a sense of community.
Nearly one out of three citizens in Melbourne had invested in installing rainwater holding tanks for their own households.
Actions that citizens took didn't stop at installing those tanks.
With help from the city, they were able to do something even more impactful.
Taking me to lesson two: empower people to save water.
Melbourne wanted people to spend less water in their homes.
And one way to do that is to spend less time in the shower.
However, interviews revealed that some people, women in particular, weren't keen on saving water that way.
Some of them honestly said, "The shower is not just to clean up.
It's my sanctuary.
It's a space I go to relax, not just clean up." So the city started offering water-efficient showerheads for free.
And then, now some people complained that the showerheads looked ugly or didn't suit their bathrooms.
So what I like to call "The Showerhead Team" developed a small water-flow regulator that can be fitted into existing showerheads.
And although showerhead beauty doesn't matter much to me, I loved how the team didn't give up and instead came up with a simple, unique solution to empower people to save water.
Within a span of four years, more than 460,000 showerheads were replaced.
When the small regulator was introduced, more than 100,000 orders of that were done.
Melbourne succeeded in reducing the water demands per capita by 50 percent.
In the United Arab Emirates, the second-most water-scarce country in the world, officials designed what they called the "Business Heroes Toolkit" in 2010.
The aim was to motivate and empower businesses to reduce water and energy consumption.
The toolkit practically taught companies how to measure their existing water-consumption levels and consisted of tips to help them reduce those levels. And it worked. Hundreds of organizations downloaded the toolkit.
And several of them joined what they called the "Corporate Heroes Network," where companies can voluntarily take on a challenge to reduce their water-consumption levels to preset targets within a period of one year.
Companies which completed the challenge saved on average 35 percent of water.
And one company, for example, implemented as many water-saving tips as they could in their office space.
They replaced their toilet-flushing techniques, taps, showerheads -- you name it.
If it saved water, they replaced it, eventually reducing their employees' water consumption by half.
Empowering individuals and companies to save water is so critical, yet not sufficient.
Countries need to look beyond the status quo and implement country-level actions to save water.
Taking me to lesson three: look below the surface.
Water savings can come from unexpected places.
Singapore is the eighth most water-scarce country in the world.
It depends on imported water for almost 60 percent of its water needs.
It's also a very small island.
As such, it needs to make use of as much space as possible to catch rainfall.
So in 2008, they built the Marina Barrage.
It's the first-ever urban water reservoir built in the middle of the city-state.
It's the largest water catchment in the country, almost one-sixth the size of Singapore.
What's so amazing about the Marina Barrage is that it has been built to make the maximum use of its large size and its unexpected yet important location.
It brings three valuable benefits to the country: it has boosted Singapore's water supply by 10 percent; it protects low areas around it from floods because of its connection to the sea; and, as you can see, it acts as a beautiful lifestyle attraction, hosting several events, from art exhibitions to music festivals, attracting joggers, bikers, tourists all around that area.
Now, not all initiatives need to be stunning or even visible.
My first home, Jordan, realized that agriculture is consuming the majority of its fresh water.
They really wanted to encourage farmers to focus on growing low water-intensive crops.
To achieve that, the local agriculture is increasing its focus on date palms and grapevines.
Those two are much more tolerant to drought conditions than many other fruits and vegetables, and at the same time, they are considered high-value crops, both locally and internationally.
Locals in Namibia, one of the most arid countries in Southern Africa, have been drinking recycled water since 1968.
Now, you may tell me many countries recycle water.
I would say yes.
But very few use it for drinking purposes, mostly because people don't like the thought of water that was in their toilets going to their taps.
But Namibia could not afford to think that way.
They looked below the surface to save water.
They are now a great example of how, when countries purify waste water to drinking standards, they can ease their water shortages, and in Namibia's case, provide drinking water for more than 300,000 citizens in its capital city.
As more countries which used to be more water rich are becoming water scarce, I say we don't need to reinvent the wheel.
If we just look at what water-poor countries have done, the solutions are out there.
Now it's really just up to all of us to take action.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to tell you about someone.
I'm going to call him Ravi Nanda.
I'm changing his name to protect his safety.
Ravi's from a community of herdspeople in Gujarat on the western coast of India, same place my own family comes from.
When he was 10 years old, his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived.
Then, 20 years later, the same company built a cement factory 100 meters from where they live now.
India has got strong environmental regulations on paper, but this company has violated many of them.
Dust from that factory covers Ravi's mustache and everything he wears.
I spent just two days in his place, and I coughed for a week.
Ravi says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water, they get sick.
He says children now walk long distances with cattle and buffalo to find uncontaminated grazing land.
He says many of those kids have dropped out of school, including three of his own.
Ravi has appealed to the company for years.
He said, "I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with them.
They wouldn't need to buy any wood."
(Laughter)
He said the company ignored every one of those letters, and so in 2013, Ravi Nanda decided to use the last means of protest he thought he had left.
He walked to the gates of that factory with a bucket of petrol in his hands, intending to set himself on fire.
Ravi is not alone in his desperation.
The UN estimates that worldwide, four billion people live without basic access to justice.
These people face grave threats to their safety, their livelihoods, their dignity.
There are almost always laws on the books that would protect these people, but they've often never heard of those laws, and the systems that are supposed to enforce those laws are corrupt or broken or both.
We are living with a global epidemic of injustice, but we've been choosing to ignore it.
Right now, in Sierra Leone, in Cambodia, in Ethiopia, farmers are being cajoled into putting their thumbprints on 50-year lease agreements, signing away all the land they've ever known for a pittance without anybody even explaining the terms.
Governments seem to think that's OK.
Right now, in the United States, in India, in Slovenia, people like Ravi are raising their children in the shadow of factories or mines that are poisoning their air and their water.
There are environmental laws that would protect these people, but many have never seen those laws, let alone having a shot at enforcing them.
And the world seems to have decided that's OK.
What would it take to change that?
Law is supposed to be the language we use to translate our dreams about justice into living institutions that hold us together.
Law is supposed to be the difference between a society ruled by the most powerful and one that honors the dignity of everyone, strong or weak.
That's why I told my grandmother 20 years ago that I wanted to go to law school.
Grandma didn't pause.
She didn't skip a beat. She said to me, "Lawyer is liar."
(Laughter)
That was discouraging.
(Laughter)
But grandma's right, in a way.
Something about law and lawyers has gone wrong.
We lawyers are usually expensive, first of all, and we tend to focus on formal court channels that are impractical for many of the problems people face.
Worse, our profession has shrouded law in a cloak of complexity.
Law is like riot gear on a police officer.
It's intimidating and impenetrable, and it's hard to tell there's something human underneath.
If we're going to make justice a reality for everyone, we need to turn law from an abstraction or a threat into something that every single person can understand, use and shape.
Lawyers are crucial in that fight, no doubt, but we can't leave it to lawyers alone.
In health care, for example, we don't just rely on doctors to serve patients.
We have nurses and midwives and community health workers.
The same should be true of justice.
Community legal workers, sometimes we call them community paralegals, or barefoot lawyers, can be a bridge.
These paralegals are from the communities they serve.
They demystify law, break it down into simple terms, and then they help people look for a solution.
They don't focus on the courts alone.
They look everywhere: ministry departments, local government, an ombudsman's office.
Lawyers sometimes say to their clients, "I'll handle it for you.
I've got you. "Paralegals have a different message, not" I'm going to solve it for you, "but" We're going to solve it together, and in the process, we're both going to grow. "
Community paralegals saved my own relationship to law.
After about a year in law school, I almost dropped out.
I was thinking maybe I should have listened to my grandmother.
It was when I started working with paralegals in Sierra Leone, in 2003, that I began feeling hopeful about the law again, and I have been obsessed ever since.
Let me come back to Ravi. 2013, he did reach the gates of that factory with the bucket of petrol in his hands, but he was arrested before he could follow through.
He didn't have to spend long in jail, but he felt completely defeated.
Then, two years later, he met someone.
I'm going to call him Kush.
Kush is part of a team of community paralegals that works for environmental justice on the Gujarat coast.
Kush explained to Ravi that there was law on his side.
Kush translated into Gujarati something Ravi had never seen.
It's called the "consent to operate." It's issued by the state government, and it allows the factory to run only if it complies with specific conditions.
So together, they compared the legal requirements with reality, they collected evidence, and they drafted an application -- not to the courts, but to two administrative institutions, the Pollution Control Board and the district administration.
Those applications started turning the creaky wheels of enforcement.
A pollution officer came for a site inspection, and after that, the company started running an air filtration system it was supposed to have been using all along.
It also started covering the 100 trucks that come and go from that plant every day.
Those two measures reduced the air pollution considerably.
The case is far from over, but learning and using law gave Ravi hope.
There are people like Kush walking alongside people like Ravi in many places.
Today, I work with a group called Namati.
Namati helps convene a global network dedicated to legal empowerment.
All together, we are over a thousand organizations in 120 countries.
Collectively, we deploy tens of thousands of community paralegals.
Let me give you another example. This is Khadija Hamsa. She is one of five million people in Kenya who faces a discriminatory vetting process when trying to obtain a national ID card.
It is like the Jim Crow South in the United States.
If you are from a certain set of tribes, most of them Muslim, you get sent to a different line.
Without an ID, you can't apply for a job.
You can't get a bank loan.
You can't enroll in university.
You are excluded from society.
Khadija tried off and on to get an ID for eight years, without success.
Then she met a paralegal working in her community named Hassan Kassim.
Hassan explained to Khadija how vetting works, he helped her gather the documents she needed, helped prep her to go before the vetting committee.
Finally, she was able to get an ID with Hassan's help.
First thing she did with it was use it to apply for birth certificates for her children, which they need in order to go to school.
In the United States, among many other problems, we have a housing crisis.
In many cities, 90 percent of the landlords in housing court have attorneys, while 90 percent of the tenants do not.
In New York, a new crew of paralegals -- they're called Access to Justice Navigators -- helps people to understand housing law and to advocate for themselves.
Normally in New York, one out of nine tenants brought to housing court gets evicted.
Researchers took a look at 150 cases in which people had help from these paralegals, and they found no evictions at all, not one.
A little bit of legal empowerment can go a long way.
I see the beginnings of a real movement, but we're nowhere near what's necessary. Not yet. In most countries around the world, governments do not provide a single dollar of support to paralegals like Hassan and Kush.
Most governments don't even recognize the role paralegals play, or protect paralegals from harm.
I also don't want to give you the impression that paralegals and their clients win every time. Not at all. That cement factory behind Ravi's village, it's been turning off the filtration system at night, when it's least likely that the company would get caught.
Running that filter costs money.
Ravi WhatsApps photos of the polluted night sky.
This is one he sent to Kush in May.
Ravi says the air is still unbreathable.
At one point this year, Ravi went on hunger strike. Kush was frustrated. He said, "We can win if we use the law." Ravi said, "I believe in the law, I do, but it's not getting us far enough."
Whether it's India, Kenya, the United States or anywhere else, trying to squeeze justice out of broken systems is like Ravi's case.
Hope and despair are neck and neck.
And so not only do we urgently need to support and protect the work of barefoot lawyers around the world, we need to change the systems themselves.
Every case a paralegal takes on is a story about how a system is working in practice.
When you put those stories together, it gives you a detailed portrait of the system as a whole.
People can use that information to demand improvements to laws and policies.
In India, paralegals and clients have drawn on their case experience to propose smarter regulations for the handling of minerals.
In Kenya, paralegals and clients are using data from thousands of cases to argue that vetting is unconstitutional.
This is a different way of approaching reform.
This is not a consultant flying into Myanmar with a template he's going to cut and paste from Macedonia, and this is not an angry tweet.
This is about growing reforms from the experience of ordinary people trying to make the rules and systems work.
This transformation in the relationship between people and law is the right thing to do.
It's also essential for overcoming all of the other great challenges of our times.
We are not going to avert environmental collapse if the people most affected by pollution don't have a say in what happens to the land and the water, and we won't succeed in reducing poverty or expanding opportunity if poor people can't exercise their basic rights.
And I believe we won't overcome the despair that authoritarian politicians prey upon if our systems stay rigged.
I called Ravi before coming here to ask permission to share his story.
I asked if there was any message he wanted to give people.
He said, "[Gujarati]." Wake up. "[Gujarati]." Don't be afraid. "[Gujarati]." Fight with paper.
"[Gujarati]." By that I think he means fight using law rather than guns. Maybe not today, maybe not this year, maybe not in five years, but find justice.
If this guy, whose entire community is being poisoned every single day, who was ready to take his own life -- if he's not giving up on seeking justice, then the world can't give up either.
Ultimately, what Ravi calls "fighting with paper" is about forging a deeper version of democracy in which we the people, we don't just cast ballots every few years, we take part daily in the rules and institutions that hold us together, in which everyone, even the least powerful, can know law, use law and shape law.
Making that happen, winning that fight, requires all of us.
Thank you guys. Thank you.
Kelo Kubu: Thanks, Vivek.
So I'm going to make a few assumptions that people in this room know what the Sustainable Development Goals are and how the process works, but I want us to talk a little bit about Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions.
Vivek Maru: Yeah. Anybody remember the Millennium Development Goals?
They were adopted in 2000 by the UN and governments around the world, and they were for essential, laudable things.
It was reduce child mortality by two thirds, cut hunger in half, crucial things.
But there was no mention of justice or fairness or accountability or corruption, and we have made progress during the 15 years when those goals were in effect, but we are way behind what justice demands, and we're not going to get there unless we take justice into account.
And so when the debate started about the next development framework, the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, our community came together around the world to argue that access to justice and legal empowerment should be a part of that new framework.
And there was a lot of resistance.
Those things are more political, more contentious than the other ones, so we didn't know until the night before whether it was going to come through. We squeaked by. The 16th out of 17 goals commits to access to justice for all, which is a big deal.
It's a big deal, yes.
Let's clap for justice.
(Applause)
Here's the scandal, though. The day the goals were adopted, most of them were accompanied by big commitments: a billion dollars from the Gates Foundation and the British government for nutrition; 25 billion in public-private financing for health care for women and children.
On access to justice, we had the words on the paper, but nobody pledged a penny, and so that is the opportunity and the challenge that we face right now.
The world recognizes more than ever before that you can't have development without justice, that people can't improve their lives if they can't exercise their rights, and what we need to do now is turn that rhetoric, turn that principle, into reality.
(Applause)
KK: How can we help?
What can people in this room do?
VM: Great question. Thank you for asking.
I would say three things. One is invest. If you have 10 dollars, or a hundred dollars, a million dollars, consider putting some of it towards grassroots legal empowerment.
It's important in its own right and it's crucial for just about everything else we care about.
Number two, push your politicians and your governments to make this a public priority.
Just like health or education, access to justice should be one of the things that a government owes its people, and we're nowhere close to that, neither in rich countries or poor countries.
Number three is: be a paralegal in your own life.
Find an injustice or a problem where you live.
It's not hard to find, if you look.
Is the river being contaminated, the one that passes through the city where you live?
Are there workers getting paid less than minimum wage or who are working without safety gear?
Get to know the people most affected, find out what the rules say, see if you can use those rules to get a solution.
If it doesn't work, see if you can come together to improve those rules.
Because if we all start knowing law, using law and shaping law, then we will be building that deeper version of democracy that I believe our world desperately needs.
(Applause)
I became obsessed with records when I was about 12 years old.
My parents used to give me money to eat and on most days, instead of eating, I would save it and buy myself a record at the end of the week.
(Laughter) So when I was a teenager, the obsession of buying cassettes, vinyls and CDs just kept growing.
I was even working in a record store for many years and only ever got paid in records.
One day I realized that I had thousands of records more than I could even listen to in my life.
I became what many of us are: record junkies -- or record diggers, as we like to call ourselves.
Record digging, as the name suggests, means getting your hands dirty.
It means spending hours rummaging through warehouses, church basements, yard sales, record stores -- all to find records that have been forgotten for decades.
Records that have become cultural waste.
The earliest record collectors from about the '30s to the 1960s found and preserved so many important records that would have been lost forever.
In those days, most cultural and public institutions didn't really care to preserve these treasures.
In many cases, they were just throwing them into the garbage.
Record digging is a lifestyle.
We're absolutely obsessed with obscure records, expensive records, dollar-bin records, crazy artwork, sub-subgenres.
And all of the tiniest details that go with each release.
When the media talks about the vinyl revival that's been happening these last few years, they often forget to mention this community that's been keeping the vinyl and the tradition and the culture alive for these last 30 years.
It's a very close-knit but competitive society, a little bit, because when you're hunting for extremely rare records, if you miss your opportunity, you might not see that record ever in your life.
But I guess the only person in here truly impressed by record collectors is another record collector.
To the outside world, we seem like a very weird, oddball group of individuals. And --
(Laughter) And they're mostly right.
All the record collectors I know are obsessive maniacs.
We know we're all crazy in some way.
(Laughter) But I think we should be viewed a little bit more like this.
We're music archaeologists. We're hunting down the lost artifact.
We all have a list of records that we would do anything to get our hands on, that we've been chasing for years, and we actually call this list our "holy grails."
When you're digging for records, you're surrounded by music you don't know.
You're surrounded by mystery and by all these dreams -- records that people once believed in.
Imagine the thousands of artists who were destined to be legends but for various reasons, were just overlooked.
Many of these records only exist in a handful of copies, and some have never even been found, never been heard.
They're literally endangered species.
I'll tell you a story that for me sort of sums up the value of the work of record diggers.
The story of a brilliant Montreal musician and composer.
Henri-Pierre Noël was born and raised in Haiti, but he lived briefly in the US and in Belgium.
He passed through Montreal what was supposed to be for two weeks, but he ended up staying for the next 40 years.
When he was young, he learned to play piano and developed a very particular way of playing his instrument: very fast and almost like a percussion.
His style was a mix of his Haitian influences and folklore mixed with the American influences that he grew up hearing.
So he created a mix of compas mixed with funk and jazz.
As a young man, he played and toured with live bands in the US and in Europe, but had never recorded an album or a song before moving to Canada.
It was in Montreal in 1979 that he released his first album called, "Piano." Completely on his own, on Henri-Pierre Noël Records.
He only made what he could afford: 2,000 copies of the record.
The record received a little bit of airplay, a little bit of support in Canada and in Haiti, but without a big label behind it, it was very, very difficult.
Back then, if your record wasn't getting played on mainstream radio, if you weren't in jukeboxes or if you weren't invited to play on TV, the odds were completely against you.
Releasing an album as an independent artist was so much more difficult than it is today, both in terms of being heard and just distributing the thing.
So, soon after, he released a second album, kept a busy schedule playing piano in various clubs in the city, but his records started to accumulate dust slowly.
And those 2,000 copies in the span of 30 years easily started to get lost until only a few copies in the world remained.
Then in the mid-2000s, a Montreal record digger that goes by the name Kobal was doing his weekly rounds of just hunting for records.
He was in a flea market surrounded by thousands of other dirty, dusty, moldy records.
That's where he found the "Piano" album.
He wasn't specifically looking for it.
Actually, you could say it sort of found him.
You could also say that after 20 years of record digging every single week, he had developed a sixth sense for finding the gold.
He took the record and inspected it: the front, the artwork, the back, the liner notes, and he was intrigued by the fact that this Haitian musician made a record in Quebec in the late '70s, so he was intrigued.
He took out his little, plastic, portable turntable that he brought with him whenever he was on these digging quests and put the record on.
So why don't we do the same thing?
(Music) He fell in love with the music instantly, but he had to know the backstory behind it.
He didn't know where it came from.
He knew the artist, at the time of the recording, was living in Montreal, so for months, he tried to track him down.
He even found Noël's business card inside the record sleeve.
That's how DIY Henri-Pierre Noël was.
So he found the card inside the record sleeve -- of course he did try to call, but after 30 years, the number didn't work anymore.
So it was only in Belgium, where the artist had once lived, that Kobal managed to find someone that knew the artist personally and gave him the contact.
So when he finally sat down with the artist, he made him a promise to someday find a way to get the album rereleased.
He then arranged for a British label called Wah Wah 45s to get the two albums reissued.
And what happens very often is, in these reissue projects, that it becomes very difficult to find the master tapes -- the original recording of the sessions.
Art can be destroyed by fires, floods, earthquakes, thrown in the garbage, or just lost forever.
But thankfully, the Henri-Pierre Noël tapes were safe and they were ready for remastering.
The record was finally rereleased and received praise from music critics, DJs and listeners worldwide -- the praise that it should have received in 1979.
The artist was so inspired that he decided to revive his music career, get back on a stage, and play for new audiences.
The artist, now in his 60s, told me, "This changed everything for me.
I went from planning my retirement to playing on the BBC Radio in London, and on Radio Canada and more." But also it gave him a chance to play in front of his three sons for the first time.
To me, this story shows perfectly the work of record diggers at its best.
Beyond the rarity and the dollar value -- and I'll be honest, we're totally obsessed by that -- the true beauty is to give art a second chance; to save art from oblivion.
The work of a good record digger is a constant loop of three phases.
The first thing we do is hunt.
We spend hours, days, years of our lives rummaging through dirty and dusty record bins.
Everything that we can do to find our hands on the gold.
Yes, you can find good records online, but for the deepest treasures, you need to get off the couch and into the wild.
(Laughter) That's why we call it record digging and not record clicking.
But then the next thing we do is we gather. Based on our taste, expertise, personal agenda, we choose carefully which records to save, which records mean something to us.
We then try and find out every little thing we can about that record -- the artist, the label and supervital information like "Who's that playing trumpet on track three?" Then we file them, we contextualize them, and we keep them safe.
We are music archivists.
And the last thing we do to close the loop is we share.
Most record diggers that I know have some sort of a way to share their discovery and elevate the artist through an album reissue, a web article, a radio show.
We give records back their rightful place in music history.
We are tastemakers and curators. We are musicologists. So for myself and most of the record collectors I've encountered in 20 years, I think that we all have some sort of an outlet for these discoveries.
I think it's our way to keep our sanity and sort of sense of purpose in this very maddening obsession, because it can be sort of a lonely one.
But I think we also do it because it serves the human need to pass along cultural knowledge.
Speaking of the need for curation, in an era of overwhelming choice, it's been demonstrated that too much choice actually hinders discovery.
For example, if you're trying to watch something on Netflix, you're actually only browsing through a catalog of 6,000 titles.
Now, compare that with Spotify; if you want to pick something to listen to, you're browsing through a catalog of 30 million songs.
So I think as you can see, this notion of paralysis by choice affects music more than movies, for example.
And there's a few studies that are starting to show the effects of this.
A recent look at the UK music market shows that the top one percent of artists in the UK are actually earning 77 percent of the total revenues inside the music industry.
That's 2013, and that's progressively getting worse, or progressing.
Anyway, if you're in the one percent, I'm sure you're happy. (Laughter) So the takeaway for me is it's easier for people to listen to music than ever before.
People have more music at their disposal than ever before, yet people choose to listen to more of the same music than ever before.
And that's a sad thing.
Inspired by my love for music research, record digging and curation, I started a website called "Music Is My Sanctuary" in 2007.
Our slogan has always been "Future Classics and Forgotten Treasures." And it shows our love for discovering music and introducing music both old and new.
From humble beginnings, we've built a worldwide platform with a massive audience with over 100 collaborators.
We've created over 10,000 pieces of content, over 500 hours of audio content.
Our audience consists of people who just want more than what's being offered to them by mainstream music channels.
They want to do -- they want to dig deeper, but they don't necessarily have 20 hours a week like us nerds, so they trust us to do that for them.
Curation is at the heart of everything we do.
We believe in human recommendations over algorithms.
I could talk about the passion of record digging for days, but let me conclude this way.
After many years of doing it, a record collector's collection becomes sort of his autobiography.
Last year, I was DJ-ing in Poland, and the people that were hosting me, they had this amazing record collection, and of course I was intrigued and I said, "Are you selling these?" They then explained to me that it was the collection that belonged to their dear friend Maceo who passed away a few months earlier.
And they were doing a project of inviting different people to take the collection and to create something new from it, whether it's sampling or DJ mixes, you know, just to give it a second life.
And so after a few hours of going through the collection myself and creating a DJ mix from it, even though I never got the chance to meet him, it felt like in a special way, me and him, we got to talk about records for a few hours.
So, as record diggers, our work and our record collections are there to be passed on to the next generation.
Beautiful art deserves to be cherished, shared and rediscovered.
Embrace curators; we are alternative voices to the mainstream music channels, digital or otherwise.
Go beyond the algorithm.
Whatever kind of music you like, there are so many websites, radio shows, DJs, record stores out there that are just waiting to share their discoveries with you.
We do this work for you.
All you have to do is open your ears and take risks.
This music will change your life.
Thank you. (Applause)
The creative process -- you know this -- from the first idea to the final product, is a long process.
It's super-iterative, lots of refinement, blood, sweat, tears and years.
And we're not saying you're going to go out for a walk and come back with the Sistine Chapel in your left hand.
So what frame of the creative process did we focus on?
Just this first part.
Just brainstorming, coming up with a new idea.
We actually ran four studies with a variety of people.
You were either walking indoors or outdoors.
And all of these studies found the same conclusion.
I'm only going to tell you about one of them today.
One of the tests we used for creativity was alternate uses.
In this test, you have four minutes.
Your job is to come up with as many other ways to use common everyday objects as you can think of.
So, for example, what else would you do with a key, other than to use it for opening up a lock?
Clearly, you could use it as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right? Maybe. That's sort of interesting, kind of new. But is it creative?
So people came up with as many ideas as they could, and we had to decide: Is this creative or not?
The definition of creativity that a lot of people go with is "appropriate novelty." For something to be appropriate, it has to be realistic, so unfortunately, you can't use a key as an eyeball. Boo! But "novel," the second thing, is that nobody had to have said it.
So for us, it had to be appropriate first, and then for novelty, nobody else in the entire population that we surveyed could have said it.
So you might think you could use a key to scratch somebody's car, but if somebody else said that, you didn't get credit for it.
Neither of you did. However, only one person said this: "If you were dying and it were a murder mystery, and you had to carve the name of the murderer into the ground with your dying words." One person said this.
(Laughter)
And it's a creative idea, because it's appropriate and it's novel.
You either did this test and came up with ideas while you were seated or while you were walking on a treadmill.
(Laughter)
They did the test twice, with different objects.
Three groups: the first group sat first and then sat again for the second test.
The second group sat first and then did the second test while walking on a treadmill.
The third group -- and this is interesting -- they walked on the treadmill first, and then they sat.
OK, so the two groups that sat together for the first test, they looked pretty similar to each other, and they averaged about 20 creative ideas per person.
The group that was walking on the treadmill did almost twice as well.
And they were just walking on a treadmill in a windowless room.
Remember, they took the test twice.
The people who sat twice for that second test didn't get any better; practice didn't help.
But these same people who were sitting and then went on the treadmill got a boost from walking.
Here's the interesting thing.
The people who were walking on the treadmill still had a residue effect of the walking, and they were still creative afterwards.
So the implication of this is that you should go for a walk before your next big meeting and just start brainstorming right away.
We have five tips for you that will help make this the best effect possible.
First, you want to pick a problem or a topic to brainstorm.
So, this is not the shower effect, when you're in the shower and all of a sudden, a new idea pops out of the shampoo bottle.
This is something you're thinking about ahead of time. They're intentionally thinking about brainstorming a different perspective on the walk.
Secondly -- I get asked this a lot: Is this OK while running?
Well, the answer for me is that if I were running, the only new idea I would have would be to stop running, so ...
(Laughter)
But if running for you is a comfortable pace, good.
It turns out, whatever physical activity is not taking a lot of attention.
So just walking at a comfortable pace is a good choice.
Also, you want to come up with as many ideas as you can.
One key of creativity is to not lock on that first idea. Keep going. Keep coming up with new ones, until you pick one or two to pursue.
You might worry that you don't want to write them down, because what if you forget them?
So the idea here is to speak them.
Everybody was speaking their new ideas.
So you can put your headphones on and record through your phone and then just pretend you're having a creative conversation, right?
Because the act of writing your idea down is already a filter.
You're going to be like, "Is this good enough to write down?" And then you write it down.
So just speak as many as you can, record them and think about them later.
And finally: don't do this forever. Right? If you're on the walk and that idea's not coming to you, come back to it later at another time.
I think we're coming up on a break right now, so I have an idea: Why don't you grab a leash and take your thoughts for a walk?
Thank you. (Applause)
What images do we see from the rest of the world?
We see natural disasters, war, terror.
We see refugees, and we see horrible diseases. Right? We see beautiful beaches, cute animals, beautiful nature, cultural rites and stuff. And then we're supposed to make the connection in our head and create a worldview out of this.
And how is that possible?
I mean, the world seems so strange.
And I don't think it is.
I don't think the world is that strange, actually.
I've got an idea. So, imagine the world as a street, where the poorest live on one end and the richest on the other, and everyone in the world lives on this street.
You live there, I live there, and the neighbors we have are the ones with the same income.
People that live in the same block as me, they are from other countries, other cultures, other religions.
The street might look something like this.
And I was curious.
In Sweden where I live, I've been meeting quite a lot of students.
And I wanted to know, where would they think they belong on a street like this?
So we changed these houses into people.
This is the seven billion people that live in the world.
And just by living in Sweden, most likely you belong there, which is the richest group.
But the students, when you ask them, they think they are in the middle.
And how can you understand the world when you see all these scary images from the world, and you think you live in the middle, while you're actually atop? Not very easy.
So I sent out photographers to 264 homes in 50 countries -- so far, still counting -- and in each home, the photographers take the same set of photos.
They take the bed, the stove, the toys and about 135 other things.
So we have 40,000 images or something at the moment, and it looks something like this.
Here we see, it says on the top, "Families in the world by income," and we have the street represented just beneath it, you can see.
And then we see some of the families we have visited.
We have the poorer to the left, the richer to the right, and everybody else in between, as the concept says.
We can go down and see the different families we have been to so far.
Here, for instance, we have a family in Zimbabwe, one in India, one in Russia, and one in Mexico, for instance.
So we can go around and look at the families this way.
But of course, we can choose if we want to see some certain countries and compare them, or regions, or if we want, to see other things.
So let's go to the front doors and see what they look like.
Go here, and this is the world by front doors, ordered by income.
And we can see the big difference from India, Philippines, China, Ukraine, in these examples, for instance.
What if we go into the home? We can look at beds.
This is what beds can look like.
Doesn't look like the glossy magazines. Doesn't look like the scary images in the media.
So remember that the students in Sweden, they thought they were in the middle of the world income.
So let's go there. We zoom in here by filtering the street to the middle, like this, and then I ask the students: Is this what your bedroom looks like?
And they would actually not feel very at home.
So we go down and see, do they feel more at home here?
And they would say, no, this is not what a Swedish typical bedroom looks like.
We go up here, and suddenly, they feel sort of at home.
And we can see here in this image, we see bedrooms in China, Netherlands, South Korea, France and the United States, for instance.
So we can click here. If we want to know more about the family, the home in which this bed stands, we can just click it and go to the family, and we can see all the images from that family.
We can go this way, too.
And of course, this is free for anyone to use.
So just go here, and please add more images, of course.
My personal favorite that everyone always tries to make me not show, I'm going to show you now, and that's toilets, because you're not really allowed to look at people's toilets, but now we can just do it, right?
So here (Laughter) we have a lot of toilets.
They look pretty much as we're used to, right?
And they are in China, Netherlands, United States, Nepal and so forth, Ukraine, France.
And they look pretty similar, right?
But remember, we are in the top.
So what about checking all the toilets?
Now it looks a bit different, doesn't it?
So this way we can visually browse through categories of imagery, using photos as data.
But not everything works as a photo.
Sometimes it's easier to understand what people do, so we also do video snippets of everyday activities, such as washing hands, doing laundry, brushing teeth, and so on. And I'm going to show you a short snippet of tooth-brushing, and we ’ re going to start at the top.
So we see people brushing their teeth.
Pretty interesting to see the same type of plastic toothbrush is being used in all these places in the same way, right?
Some are more serious than others --
(Laughter)
but still, the toothbrush is there.
And then, coming down to this poorer end, then we will see people start using sticks, and they will sometimes use their finger to brush their teeth.
So this particular woman in Malawi, when she brushes her teeth, she scrapes some mud off from her wall and she mixes it with water, and then she's brushing.
Therefore, in the Dollar Street material, we have tagged this image not only as her wall, which it is, but also as her toothpaste, because that is also what she uses it for.
So we can say, in the poorer end of the street, you will use a stick or your finger, you come to the middle, you will start using a toothbrush, and then you come up to the top, and you will start using one each.
Pretty nice, not sharing a toothbrush with your grandma.
And you can also look at some countries.
Here, we have the income distribution within the US, most people in the middle.
We have a family we visited in the richer end, the Howards. We can see their home here. And we also visited a family in the poorer end, down here.
And then what we can do now is we can do instant comparisons of things in their homes.
Let's look in their cutlery drawer.
So, observe the Hadleys: they have all their cutlery in a green plastic box. and they have a few different types and some of them are plastic, while the Howards, they have this wooden drawer with small wooden compartments in it and a section for each type of cutlery.
We can add more families, and we can see kitchen sinks, or maybe living rooms.
Of course, we can do the same in other countries.
So we go to China, we pick three families. we look at their houses, we can look at their sofas, we can look at their stoves.
And when you see these stoves, I think it's obvious that it's a stupid thing that usually, when we think about other countries, we think they have a certain way of doing things.
But look at these stoves. Very different, right, because it depends on what income level you have, how you're going to cook your food.
But the cool thing is when we start comparing across countries.
So here we have China and the US.
See the big overlap between these two.
So we picked the two homes we have already seen in these countries, the Wus and the Howards.
Standing in their bedroom, pretty hard to tell which one is China and which one is the US, right?
Both have brown leather sofas, and they have similar play structures.
Most likely both are made in China, so, I mean, that's not very strange --
(Laughter)
but that is similar.
We can of course go down to the other end of the street, adding Nigeria.
So let's compare two homes in China and Nigeria.
Looking at the family photos, they do not look like they have a lot in common, do they? But start seeing their ceiling. They have a plastic shield and grass.
They have the same kind of sofa, they store their grain in similar ways, they're going to have fish for dinner, and they're boiling their water in identical ways.
So if we would visit any of these homes, there's a huge risk that we would say we know anything about the specific way you do things in China or Nigeria, while, looking at this, it's quite obvious -- this is how you do things on this income level.
That is what you can see when you go through the imagery in Dollar Street.
So going back to the figures, the seven billion people of the world, now we're going to do a quick recap.
We're going to look at comparisons of things in the poorest group: beds, roofs, cooking.
And observe, in all these comparisons, their homes are chosen so they are in completely different places of the world.
But what we see is pretty identical.
So the poorest billion cooking would look somewhat the same in these two places; you might not have shoes; eating, if you don't have a spoon; storing salt would be similar whether you're in Asia or in Africa; and going to the toilet would be pretty much the same experience whether you're in Nigeria or Nepal.
In the middle, we have a huge group of five billion, but here we can see you will have electric light, most likely; you will no longer sleep on the floor; you will store your salt in a container; you will have more than one spoon; you will have more than one pen; the ceiling is no longer leaking that much; you will have shoes; you might have a phone, toys, and produce waste.
Coming to our group up here, similar shoes, Jordan, US.
We have sofas, fruits, hairbrushes, bookshelves, toilet paper in Tanzania, Palestine, hard to distinguish if we would sit in US, Palestine or Tanzania from this one.
Vietnam, Kenya: wardrobes, lamps, black dogs, floors, soap, laundry, clocks, computers, phones, and so on, right?
So we have a lot of similarities all over the world, and the images we see in the media, they show us the world is a very, very strange place.
But when we look at the Dollar Street images, they do not look like that.
So using Dollar Street, we can use photos as data, and country stereotypes -- they simply fall apart.
So the person staring back at us from the other side of the world actually looks quite a lot like you.
And that implies both a call to action and a reason for hope.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We've had it all wrong. Everybody. We've had it all wrong.
The very last thing we need to do is clean the ocean. Very last. Yeah, there is a garbage truck of plastic entering the ocean every minute of every hour of every day.
And countless birds and animals are dying just from encountering plastic.
We are experiencing the fastest rate of extinction ever, and plastic is in the food chain.
is clean the ocean. Very last. And I'm still here, standing in front of you, telling you the very last thing we need to do
If you were to walk into a kitchen, sink overflowing, water spilling all over the floor, soaking into the walls, you had to think fast, you're going to panic; you've got a bucket, a mop or a plunger.
What do you do first?
Why don't we turn off the tap?
It would be pointless to mop or plunge or scoop up the water if we don't turn off the tap first.
Why aren't we doing the same for the ocean?
Even if the Ocean Cleanup project, beach plastic recycling programs or any well-meaning ocean plastic company was a hundred percent successful, it would still be too little, too late.
We're trending to produce over 300 million ton of plastic this year.
Roughly eight million ton are racing to flow into the ocean to join the estimated 150 million ton already there.
Reportedly, 80 percent of ocean plastic is coming from those countries that have extreme poverty.
And if you live in the grips of poverty concerned, always, about food or shelter or a sense of security, recycling -- it's beyond your realm of imagination.
And that is exactly why I created the Plastic Bank.
We are the world's largest chain of stores for the ultra-poor, where everything in the store is available to be purchased using plastic garbage. Everything. School tuition. Medical insurance. Wi-Fi, cell phone minutes, power.
Sustainable cooking fuel, high-efficiency stoves.
And we keep wanting to add everything else that the world may need and can't afford.
Our chain of stores in Haiti are more like community centers, where one of our collectors, Lise Nasis, has the opportunity to earn a living by collecting material from door to door, from the streets, from business to business.
And at the end of her day, she gets to bring the material back to us, where we weigh it, we check it for quality, and we transfer the value into her account.
Lise now has a steady, reliable source of income.
And that value we transfer into an online account for her.
And because it's a savings account, it becomes an asset that she can borrow against.
And because it's online, she has security against robbery, and I think more importantly, she has a new sense of worth.
And even the plastic has a new sense of value. Hm.
And that plastic we collect, and we add value to, we sort it, we remove labels, we remove caps.
We either shred it or we pack it into bales and get it ready for export.
Now, it's no different than walking over acres of diamonds.
If Lise was to walk over acres of diamonds but there was no store, no bank, no way to use the diamonds, no way to exchange them, they'd be worthless, too.
And Lise was widowed after the 2010 Haitian earthquake, left homeless without an income.
And as a result of the program, Lise can afford her two daughters ' school tuition and uniforms.
Now, that plastic we sell.
We sell it to suppliers of great brands like Marks and Spencer, who have commissioned the use of social plastic in their products.
Or like Henkel, the German consumer-goods company, who are using social plastic directly into their manufacturing.
We've closed the loop in the circular economy.
Now buy shampoo or laundry detergent that has social plastic packaging, and you are indirectly contributing to the extraction of plastic from ocean-bound waterways and alleviating poverty at the same time.
And that model is completely replicable.
In São Paulo, a church sermon encourages parishioners to not just bring offering on Sunday, but the recycling, too.
We then match the church with the poor.
Or, I believe more powerfully, we could match a mosque in London with an impoverished church in Cairo.
Or like in Vancouver, with our bottle-deposit program: now any individual or any group can now return their deposit-refundable recyclables, and instead of taking back the cash, they have the opportunity to deposit that value into the account of the poor around the world.
We can now use our recycling to support and create recyclers.
One bottle deposited at home could help extract hundreds around the world.
Or, like Shell, the energy company, who's invested in our plastic-neutral program.
Plastic neutrality is like carbon-neutral.
But plastic neutrality invests in recycling infrastructure where it doesn't exist. And it provides an incentive for the poor by providing a price increase.
Or — like in the slums of Manila, where the smallest market with a simple scale and a phone can now accept social plastic as a new form of payment by weight, allowing them to serve more people and have their own greater social impact.
And what's common here is that social plastic is money.
at the same time. Social plastic is money, a globally recognizable and tradable currency that, when used, alleviates poverty and cleans the environment
It's not just plastic.
It's not recycled plastic, it's social plastic, a material whose value is transferred through the lives of the people who encounter it, rich and poor.
Humans have produced over eight trillion kilograms of plastic, most of it still here as waste. Eight trillion kilograms. Worth roughly 50 cents a kilo, we're potentially unleashing a four-trillion-dollar value.
See, I see social plastic as the Bitcoin for the earth --
(Laughter)
and available for everyone.
Now the entire ecosystem is managed and supported through an online banking platform that provides for the safe, authentic transfer of value globally.
You can now deposit your recyclables in Vancouver or Berlin, and a family could withdraw building bricks or cell phone minutes in the slums of Manila. Or Lise — she could deposit recycling at a center in Port-au-Prince, and her mother could withdraw cooking fuel or cash across the city.
And the app adds rewards, incentives, group prizes, user rating.
We've gamified recycling.
We add fun and formality into an informal industry.
We're operating in Haiti and the Philippines.
We've selected staff and partners for Brazil.
And this year, we're committing to India and Ethiopia.
We're collecting hundreds and hundreds of tons of material.
We continue to add partners and customers, and we increase our collection volumes every day.
Now as a result of our program with Henkel, they've committed to use over 100 million kilograms of material every year.
That alone will put hundreds of millions of dollars into the hands of the poor in the emerging economies.
And so now, we can all be a part of the solution and not the pollution.
And so, OK, maybe cleaning the ocean is futile. It might be. But preventing ocean plastic could be humanity's richest opportunity.
Thank you. (Applause)
Imagine that you're a member of Congress.
You've worked very hard.
You've knocked on thousands of doors, sweating and shivering, depending on the season.
You've made hundreds, maybe thousands of phone calls to people you don't even know asking for their support, begging for their money.
And now you've got one of these. It's hanging on a door in Washington, DC. It says you're a member of Congress, that you represent the people of your state.
Now, imagine you're a conservative member of Congress.
For some of you here in Boston, Massachusetts, that's going to take a powerful imagination, all right?
(Laughter)
But imagine with me that you're a conservative member of Congress.
You grew up on Milton Friedman.
You love his free markets, free enterprise and free trade.
You've watched Ronald Reagan's farewell address over and over, and you cry every time --
(Laughter)
he gets to the part about the shining city on the hill, and how if the city had to have walls, the walls had doors -- doors to let in those yearning to breathe free.
You get goosebumps when you think of him telling Mr. Gorbachev to tear down his wall.
You're a conservative member of Congress, and you agree with President John F. Kennedy that America is an exceptional place.
For inspiration, you go to YouTube and you watch his speech at Rice University, September of 1962, the "moon shot" speech.
And you're amazed that he admits in that speech -- a speech of 17 minutes of pure American exceptionalism -- that some of the materials needed for the spacecraft hadn't been invented yet. No matter. We're going to the Moon before the decade is out.
You agree with him that the vows of this nation can be fulfilled only if we in this nation are first and therefore we intend to be first.
You've taken as your own the affect that he so embodied. That when leaders are optimistic, they're saying they believe in the people they represent.
You're a conservative member of Congress, and you believe in the precautionary principle.
You believe in data-driven analysis.
You know that climate change is real and human-caused, and you see in climate change a silent and slow-moving Sputnik moment.
One that calls for the greatness of your nation as much as the original Sputnik moment.
You are a conservative member of Congress.
You high-five the memory of Jack Kemp, and believe with him that the test of conservatism is that it works for everyone, regardless of skin color.
You're appalled by the alt-right.
You want them to have nothing to do with your brand, your party, your legacy.
You utterly reject them. You --
(Applause)
You're a conservative member of Congress,
You rise with compassion to protect the lives of the unborn, but otherwise you think the bedroom of consenting adults is a rather strange place for the government to be.
You are a conservative member of Congress.
With John Adams, you fear the mob.
Because you know, as he knew, that a mob is not able to protect liberty, not even its own.
And you're amazed at the wisdom that he and other framers had in establishing a slow, deliberative governing process -- an inherently conservative governing process.
It would serve a country.
It would grow far greater than they could ever imagine.
You are a conservative member of Congress.
You fear the fire of populist nationalism, because you know that those who play with fire can't control it.
You see their pitchforks and torches, and you know they're not good building tools.
The pitchforks and torches can tear down and burn up but they can't build up.
They can't build up the institutions and the communities so necessary to a stable and prosperous country.
You're a conservative member of Congress, and you fear the next county party convention.
You so wish for your party to be the grand opportunity party, not the grumpy old party.
(Laughter)
You know that they want to hear from you some old saw about how a secret Muslim, non-American socialist took over in the White House and destroyed the country, and you know that none of that's true.
(Applause)
You know that they want to hear your say that you're OK with insults, OK with "lock her up" chants and OK with policy pronouncements with all the sincerity and thoughtfulness that 140 characters can muster.
You are a conservative member of Congress.
You realize that many in your party look to some good old days that you know never existed.
They hold on, for example, to the fossils that fueled the last century of growth, but you know that better, cleaner more abundant fuels await us, and you know that that abundance can lead the world to more energy, more mobility and more freedom.
You're a conservative member of Congress,
You realize that many in your party pine for the '50s and the' 60s because those were, after all, the good old days.
But you know that the Cuyahoga River was on fire back then.
You know that in Pittsburgh, street lights came on at noon because of the soot in the air.
The schools were segregated, neighborhoods redlined, that communism threatened freedom, and if you got cancer, you weren't likely to fight for long.
You're a conservative member of Congress, and you want to sound like JFK at Rice, where JFK said, "It's understandable why some would have us stay where we are a little bit longer, to wait and to rest." But everything within you says with him, this city of Houston, this state of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.
You are ready to lead.
You are ready to prove the power of free enterprise to solve challenges like climate change.
You are ready to lead.
You -- So I've got a suggestion for you then: now. Step out, step up. You know, we ask America's best to die on literal hills in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.
Is it too much to ask you to die a figurative death on a political hill in Washington, DC?
You know, at the end of your time in Washington, they're going to take this plaque off the door.
They're going to hand it to you; you're going to go home with it.
Can you imagine the emptiness of knowing that you stood for nothing, that you risk nothing, that all you did was follow fearful people to where they were already going rather than trying to lead them to a better place?
If you're not willing to lose your seat in Congress, there's really very little reason to be there.
(Applause)
So here's the thing: it's not too late.
There's still time to lead. Speak out, speak up, call lunacy what it is: lunacy. Tell the American people that we still have moon shots in us.
Tell the folks at the county party convention, "You bet free enterprise can solve climate change." Tell them that Milton Friedman would say to tax pollution rather than profits.
Tell them that it's OK — no, it's a good thing that progressives would agree.
Tell them the very good news that we can bring America together to solve these challenges and to lead the world.
Tell them that free enterprise can do these things.
Tell them that America must stop the dividing, and must start the uniting. Tell them. Play your part before it's too late.
(Applause)
Thank you very much.
My best friend recently had a baby.
And when I met him, I was in awe of witnessing this tiny, beautiful being enter into our lives.
I also had this realization that he wasn't just entering our lives, he was entering the world -- this crazy world that, especially now, feels so incredibly challenging.
I spend a lot time in my work talking to people about who we are, who we must be and what our healing looks like.
So the first time I held him, I had my pep talk ready.
You know, I wanted him to know that the way we find our strength is through our challenges.
I wanted him to know that we can all do something big when we start small.
I wanted him to know that each of us is more resilient than we could ever imagine.
So here I am holding little Thelonious.
I look down at him, and it hits me: he's a baby. (Laughter) He's not going to understand a single word I say to him.
So instead, I thought it would probably be a better idea if I went home and wrote.
So, this is for grownups, but it's also for Thelonious, when he's old enough to read it:
The world will say to you, "Be a better person." Do not be afraid to say, "Yes." Start by being a better listener.
Start by being better at walking down the street. See people. Say, "Hello." Ask how they are doing and listen to what they say.
Start by being a better friend, a better parent, a better child to your parents; a better sibling, a better lover, a better partner.
Start by being a better neighbor.
Meet someone you do not know, and get to know them.
The world will say to you, "What are you going to do?" Do not be afraid to say, "I know I can't do everything, but I can do something." Walk into more rooms saying, "I'm here to help." Become intimate with generosity.
Give what you can give, and do what you can do.
Give dollars, give cents, give your time, give your love, give your heart, give your spirit.
The world will say to you, "We need peace." Find your peace within, hold it sacred, bring it with you everywhere you go.
Peace cannot be shared or created with others if we cannot first generate it within.
The world will say to you, "They are the enemy." Love enough to know that just because someone disagrees with you, it does not make them your enemy.
You may not win an argument, you may not change a mind, but if you choose to, you can always achieve the triumph of radical empathy -- an understanding of the heart.
The world will say to you, "We need justice." Investigate.
Find truth beyond the stories you are told.
Find truth beyond the way things seem.
Ask, "Why?" Ask, "Is this fair?" Ask, "How did we get here?" Do this with compassion. Do this with forgiveness. Learn to forgive others.
Start by truly learning how to forgive yourself.
We are all more than our mistakes.
We are all more than who we were yesterday.
We are all deserving of our dignity.
See yourself in others.
Recognize that your justice is my justice, and mine is yours.
The world will say to you, There can be no liberation for one of us if the other is not free. (Applause) "I am violent." Respond by saying, "I am not.
The world will say to you, Not with my words and not with my actions." "We need to heal the planet." Start by saying, "No, thank you. I don't need a plastic bag." Recycle, reuse.
Start by picking up one piece of trash on your block.
The world will say to you, "There are too many problems." Do not be afraid to be a part of the solutions.
Start by discussing the issues.
We cannot overcome what we ignore.
The more we talk about things, the more we see that the issues are connected because we are connected.
The world will say to you, "We need to end racism." Start by healing it in your own family.
The world will say to you, "How do we speak to bias and bigotry?" Start by having the first conversation at your own kitchen table.
The world will say to you, "There is so much hate." Devote yourself to love.
Love yourself so much that you can love others without barriers and without judgment.
When the world asks us big questions that require big answers, we have two options.
One: to feel so overwhelmed or unqualified, we do nothing.
Two: to start with one small act and qualify ourselves.
I am the director of national security, and so are you.
Maybe no one appointed us and there were no senate confirmations, but we can secure a nation.
When you help just one person to be more secure, a nation is more secure.
With just one outstretched hand that says, "Are you OK?
I am here for you," we can transform insecurity into security.
We find ourselves saying to the world, "What should I do?" "What should we do?" The better question might be: "How am I showing up?" I ask the world for peace, but do I show up with peace when I see my family and friends?
I ask the world to end hatred, but do I show up with love not only for those I know, but those I don't know?
Do I show up with love for those whose ideas conflict with my own?
I ask the world to end suffering, but do I show up for those who are suffering on my street corner?
We say to the world, "Please change; we need change." But how do we show up to change our own lives?
How do we show up to change the lives of the people in our communities?
James Baldwin said, "Everything now, we must assume is in our own hands; we have no right to assume otherwise." This has always been true.
No one nominated Harriet Tubman to her purpose, to her mission, to her courage.
She did not say, "I'm not a congressman or the president of the United States, so how could I possibly participate in the fight to abolish a system as big as slavery?" She instead spent 10 years making 19 trips, freeing 300 people, one group of people at a time.
Think about the children of those 300 people, the grandchildren, the great-grandchildren and beyond.
Our righteous acts create immeasurable ripples in the endless river of justice.
Whether it's Hurricane Katrina, Harvey, Irma or Maria, people did not say, "There is so much damage.
What should I do? "They got to work on what they could do.
Those with boats got in their boats and started loading in every woman, man and child they came across.
Near and far, people gave their dollars, they gave their cents, they gave their hearts, they gave their spirit.
We spend so much time thinking we don't have the power to change the world.
We forget that the power to change someone's life is always in our hands.
Change-making does not belong to one group of people; it belongs to all of us.
You don't have to wait on anyone to tell you that you are in this. Begin. Start by doing what you can with what you've got, where you are and in your own way.
We don't have to be heroes, wear a uniform, call ourselves activists or get elected to participate.
We just have to be brave enough to care.
Now, around the time Thelonious was born, I went to the birthday party of a man named Gene Moretti.
It was his 100th birthday, which means he lived in the United States through the Depression, World War II, the struggle for workers' rights, the achievement of a woman's right to vote, the Civil Rights Movement, a man on the moon, the Vietnam War and the election of the first black president.
I sat with him, and I said, "Gene, you have lived in America for 100 years.
Do you have any advice during these current times?" He smiled and said to me simply, "Yes.
Be good to as many people as possible. "And as he danced with my mother, who is, by the way, half his age, in a room full of generations of his family and hundreds of people, many of whom traveled thousands of miles to be there to celebrate him, I realized that he had not just given me advice, he had given me the first step that every single one of us is capable of making if we want to create a real, wholehearted impact on the world around us, right now." Be good to as many people as possible. "
A few years ago, I set out on a mission to find God.
Now, I'm going to tell you right up front that I failed, which, as a lawyer, is a really hard thing for me to admit.
But on that failed journey, a lot of what I found was enlightening.
And one thing in particular gave me a lot of hope.
It has to do with the magnitude and significance of our differences.
So, I was raised in America by Indian parents -- culturally Hindu, but practicing a strict and relatively unknown religion outside of India called Jainism.
To give you an idea of just how minority that makes me: people from India represent roughly one percent of the US population; Hindus, about 0.7 percent; Jains, at most .00046 percent.
To put that in context: more people visit the Vermont Teddy Bear Factory each year than are followers of the Jain religion in America.
To add to my minority mix, my parents then decided, "What a great idea!
Let's send her to Catholic school "—
(Laughter)
where my sister and I were the only non-white, non-Catholic students in the entire school.
At the Infant Jesus of Prague School in Flossmoor, Illinois -- yes, that's really what it was called -- we were taught to believe that there is a single Supreme Being who is responsible for everything, the whole shebang, from the creation of the Universe to moral shepherding to eternal life.
But at home, I was being taught something entirely different.
Followers of the Jain religion don't believe in a single Supreme Being or even a team of Supreme Beings.
Instead, we're taught that God manifests as the perfection of each of us as individuals, and that we're actually spending our entire lives striving to remove the bad karmas that stand in the way of us becoming our own godlike, perfect selves.
On top of that, one of the core principles of Jainism is something called "non-absolutism." Non-absolutists believe that no single person can hold ownership or knowledge of absolute truth, even when it comes to religious beliefs.
Good luck testing that concept out on the priests and nuns in your Catholic school.
(Laughter)
No wonder I was confused and hyperaware of how different I was from my peers.
Cut to 20-something years later, and I found myself to be a highly spiritual person, but I was floundering.
I was spiritually homeless.
I came to learn that I was a "None," which isn't an acronym or a clever play on words, nor is it one of these.
It's simply the painfully uninspired name given to everyone who checks off the box "none" when Pew Research asks them about their religious affiliation.
(Laughter)
Now, a couple of interesting things about Nones are: there are a lot of us, and we skew young.
In 2014, there were over 56 million religiously unaffiliated Nones in the United States.
And Nones account for over one-third of adults between the ages of 18 to 33.
But the most interesting thing to me about Nones is that we're often spiritual.
In fact, 68 percent of us believe, with some degree of certainty, that there is a God.
We're just not sure who it is.
(Laughter)
So the first takeaway for me when I realized I was a None and had found that information out was that I wasn't alone.
I was finally part of a group in America that had a lot of members, which felt really reassuring.
But then the second, not-so-reassuring takeaway was that, oh, man, there are a lot of us.
That can't be good, because if a lot of highly spiritual people are currently godless, maybe finding God is not going to be as easy as I had originally hoped.
So that is when I decided that on my spiritual journey, I was going to avoid the obvious places and skip the big-box religions altogether and instead venture out into the spiritual fringe of mediums and faith healers and godmen.
But remember, I'm a non-absolutist, which means I was pretty inclined to keep a fairly open mind, which turned out to be a good thing, because I went to a witch's potluck dinner at the LGBT Center in New York City, where I befriended two witches; drank a five-gallon jerrican full of volcanic water with a shaman in Peru; got a hug from a saint in the convention center -- she smelled really nice --
(Laughter)
chanted for hours in a smoke-filled, heat-infused sweat lodge on the beaches of Mexico; worked with a tequila-drinking medium to convene with the dead, who oddly included both my deceased mother-in-law and the deceased manager of the hip-hop group The Roots.
(Laughter)
Yeah, my mother-in-law told me she was really happy her son had chosen me for his wife. Duh! But --
(Laughter)
Yeah. But the manager of The Roots said that maybe I should cut back on all the pasta I was eating.
I think we can all agree that it was lucky for my husband that it wasn't his dead mother who suggested I lay off carbs.
(Laughter)
I also joined a laughing yoga group out of South Africa; witnessed a woman have a 45-minute orgasm -- I am not making this up -- as she tapped into the energy of the universe -- I think I'm going to go back there --
(Laughter)
called God from a phone booth in the Nevada desert at Burning Man, wearing a unitard and ski goggles; and I had an old Indian guy lie on top of me, and no, he wasn't my husband.
This was a perfect stranger named Paramji, and he was chanting into my chakras as he tapped into the energy forces of the Universe to heal my "yoni," which is a Sanskrit word for "vagina."
(Laughter)
I was going to have a slide here, but a few people suggested that a slide of my yoni at TED -- even TEDWomen -- not the best idea.
(Laughter)
Very early in my quest, I also went to see the Brazilian faith healer John of God at his compound down in Brazil.
Now, John of God is considered a full-trance medium, which basically means he can talk to dead people.
But in his case, he claims to channel a very specific group of dead saints and doctors in order to heal whatever's wrong with you.
And although John of God does not have a medical degree or even a high school diploma, he actually performs surgery -- the real kind, with a scalpel, but no anesthesia.
Yeah, I don't know.
He also offers invisible surgery, where there is no cutting, and surrogate surgery, where he supposedly can treat somebody who is thousands of miles away by performing a procedure on a loved one.
Now, when you go to visit John of God, there are all kinds of rules and regulations.
It's a whole complicated thing, but the bottom line is that you can visit John of God and present him with three things that you would like fixed, and he will set the dead saints and doctors to work on your behalf to get the job done.
(Laughter)
Now, before you snicker, consider that, at least according to his website, over eight million people -- including Oprah, the Goddess of Daytime TV -- have gone to see John of God, and I was pre-wired to keep an open mind.
But to be honest, the whole thing for me was kind of weird and inconclusive, and in the end, I flew home, even more confused than I already started out.
But that doesn't mean I came home empty-handed.
In the weeks leading up to my trip to Brazil, I mentioned my upcoming plans to some friends and to a couple of colleagues at Google, where I was a lawyer at the time.
And I might have mentioned it to a couple more people because I'm chatty, including my neighbor, the guy who works at the local coffee shop I go to each morning, the checkout lady at Whole Foods and a stranger who sat next to me on the subway.
I told each of them where I was going and why, and I offered to carry three wishes of theirs down to Brazil, explaining that anyone going to see John of God could act as a proxy for others and save them the trip.
And to my surprise, my in-box overflowed.
Friends told friends who told friends, and those friends apparently told more friends, other strangers and the guys at their coffee shops, until it seemed that days before I left for Brazil that there was no one who did not have my email address.
And at the time, all I could conclude was that I had offered too much to too many.
But when I actually reread those messages a few years later, I noticed something completely different.
Those emails actually shared three commonalities, the first of which was rather curious.
Almost everyone sent me meticulous details about how they could be reached.
I had told them, or their friends had told them, that along with the list of the three things they wanted fixed, I needed their photo, their name and their date of birth.
But they gave me full addresses, with, like, apartment numbers and zip codes, as if John of God was going to stop by their house and see them in person or send along a package.
It was as if, in the highly unlikely event that their wishes were granted by John of God, they just wanted to make sure that they weren't delivered to the wrong person or the wrong address.
Even if they didn't believe, they were hedging their bets.
The second commonality was just as curious, but far more humbling.
Virtually everyone -- the stranger on the subway, the guy at the coffee shop, the lawyer down the hall, the Jew, the atheist, the Muslim, the devout Catholic -- all asked for essentially the same three things.
OK, there were a couple of outliers, and yes, a few people asked for cash.
But when I eliminated what were ultimately a handful of anomalies, the similarities were staggering.
Almost every single person first asked for good health for themselves and their families.
Almost universally, they next asked for happiness and then love, in that order: health, happiness, love.
Sometimes they asked for a specific health issue to be fixed, but more often than not, they just asked for good health in general.
When it came to happiness, they each phrased it slightly differently, but they all asked for the same specific subtype of happiness, too -- the kind of happiness that sinks in and sets down roots in your soul; the kind of happiness that could sustain us, even if we were to lose absolutely everything else.
And for love, they all asked for the kind of romantic love, the soul mate that we read about in epic romantic novels, the kind of love that will stay with us till the end of our days.
Sorry, that's my husband.
Crap! Now I forgot my place.
(Laughter)
So by and large, all of these friends and strangers, regardless of their background, race or religion, all asked for the same things, and they were the same things that I really wanted, the simplified version of the basic human needs identified by social scientists like Abraham Maslow and Manfred Max-Neef.
No one asked for answers to the big existential questions or for proof of God or the meaning of life like I had set out to find.
They didn't even ask for an end to war or global hunger.
Even when they could have asked for absolutely anything, they all asked for health, happiness and love.
So now those emails had a third commonality as well.
Each of them ended in the exact same way.
Instead of thanking me for carting their wishes all the way to Brazil, everyone said, "Please don't tell anyone." So I decided to tell everyone --
(Laughter)
right here on this stage, not because I'm untrustworthy, but because the fact that we have so much in common feels especially important for us all to hear, especially now, when so many of the world's problems seem to be because we keep focusing on the things that make us different, not on what binds us together.
And look -- I am the first to admit that I am not a statistician, and that the data I presented to you that I just accumulated in my in-box is more anecdotal than scientific, more qualitative than quantitative.
It is, as anyone who works with data would tell you, hardly a statistically significant or demographically balanced sample.
But nonetheless, I find myself thinking about those emails every time I reflect back on the bias and prejudice that I've faced in my life, or when there's another hate crime or a senseless tragedy that underscores the disheartening sense that our differences might be insurmountable.
I then remind myself that I have evidence that the humbling, unifying commonality of our humanity is that, even when presented with the opportunity to ask for anything at all, most of us want the same things, and that this is true no matter who we are, what name we call our god, or which religion, if any, we call home.
I then also note that apparently some of us want these things so badly that we would email a None, a spiritually confused None like me -- some might say otherwise confused as well -- and that we would seek out this stranger and email her our deepest wishes, just in case there is the remote possibility that they might be granted by someone who is not a god, much less our god, someone who is not even a member of our chosen religion, someone who, when you look at him on paper, seems like an unlikely candidate to deliver.
And so now, when I reflect back on my spiritual quest, even though I did not find God, I found a home in this: even today, in a world fractured by religious, ethnic, political, philosophical, and racial divides, even with all of our obvious differences, at the end of the day, and the most fundamental level, we are all the same.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Nina Dølvik Brochmann: We grew up believing that the hymen is a proof of virginity.
But it turns out, we were wrong.
What we discovered is that the popular story we're told about female virginity is based on two anatomical myths.
The truth has been known in medical communities for over 100 years, yet somehow these two myths continue to make life difficult for women around the world.
Ellen Støkken Dahl: The first myth is about blood.
It tells us that the hymen breaks and bleeds the first time a woman has vaginal sex.
In other words, if there is no blood on the sheets afterwards, then the woman was simply not a virgin.
The second myth is a logical consequence of the first.
Since the hymen is thought to break and bleed, people also believe that it actually disappears or is in some way radically altered during a woman's first intercourse.
If that were true, one would easily be able to determine if a woman is a virgin or not by examining her genitals, by doing a virginity check.
NDB: So that's our two myths: virgins bleed, and hymens are lost forever.
Now, this may sound like a minor issue to you.
Why should you care about an obscure little skin fold on the female body?
But the truth is, this is about so much more than an anatomical misunderstanding.
The myths about the hymen have lived on for centuries because they have cultural significance.
They have been used as a powerful tool in the effort to control women's sexuality in about every culture, religion and historical decade.
Women are still mistrusted, shamed, harmed and, in the worst cases, subjected to honor killings if they don't bleed on their wedding night.
Other women are forced through degrading virginity checks, simply to obtain a job, to save their reputation or to get married.
ESD: Like in Indonesia, where women are systematically examined to enter military service.
After the Egyptian uprisings in 2011, a group of female protesters were forced to undergo virginity checks by their military.
In Oslo, doctors are examining the hymens of young girls to reassure parents that their children are not ruined.
And sadly, the list goes on.
Women are so afraid not to live up to the myths about the hymen that they choose to use different virginity quick fixes to assure a bleeding.
That could be plastic surgery, known as "revirgination," it could be vials of blood poured on the sheets after sex or fake hymens bought online, complete with theater blood and a promise to "kiss your deep, dark secret goodbye."
NDB: By telling girls that no deed can be kept secret, that their bodies will reveal them no matter what, we have endowed them with fear.
Girls are afraid of ruining themselves, either through sport, play, tampon use or a sexual activity.
We have curtailed their opportunities and their freedoms.
It's time we put an end to the virginity fraud.
It's time we break the myths about the hymen once and for all.
ESD: We are medical students, sexual health workers and the authors of "The Wonder Down Under."
(Laughter)
That's a popular science book about the female genitals.
And in our experience, people seem to believe that the hymen is some kind of a seal covering the vaginal opening.
In Norwegian, it is even called "the virgin membrane." And with this, we picture something fragile, something easily destructible, something you can rip through, perhaps like a sheet of plastic wrapping.
You may have wondered why we brought a hula hoop onstage today.
We'll show you.
(Laughter)
Now, it is very hard to hide that something has happened to this hoop, right?
It is different before and after I punched it.
The seal is broken, and unless we change the plastic, it won't get back to its intact state.
So if we wanted to do a virginity check on this hoop right here, right now, that would be very easy.
It's easy to say that this hoop is not a virgin anymore.
(Laughter)
NDB: But the hymen is nothing like a piece of plastic you can wrap around your food, or a seal.
In fact ... it's more like this -- a scrunchie or a rubber band.
The hymen is a rim of tissue at the outer opening of the vagina.
And usually, it has a doughnut or a half-moon shape with a large, central hole.
But this varies a lot, and sometimes hymens can have fringes, it can have several holes, or it can consist of lobes.
In other words, hymens naturally vary a lot in looks, and that is what makes it so hard to do a virginity check.
virgins bleed, ESD: Now that we know a bit more about the hymen's anatomy, it's time to get back to our two myths: hymens are lost forever.
But the hymen doesn't have to break at all.
The hymen is like a scrunchie in function as well as in looks.
And you can stretch a scrunchie, right?
(Laughter)
You can stretch a hymen, too.
In fact, it's very elastic.
And for a lot of women, the hymen will be elastic enough to handle a vaginal intercourse without sustaining any damage.
For other women, the hymen may tear a bit to make room for the penis, but that won't make it disappear.
But it may look a bit different from before.
It naturally follows that you can't examine the hymen to check for virginity status.
This was noted over 100 years ago in 1906 by the Norwegian doctor Marie Jeancet.
She examined a middle-aged sex worker and concluded that her genitalia were reminiscent of a teenage virgin.
But that makes sense, right?
Because if her hymen was never damaged during sex, then what were we expecting to see?
ESD: Since hymens come in every shape and form, it is difficult to know if a dent or a fold in it is there because of previous damage or if it's just a normal anatomical variant.
The absurdity of virgin testing is illustrated in a study done on 36 pregnant teenagers.
When doctors examined their hymens, they could only find clear signs of penetration in two out of the 36 girls.
So unless you believe in 34 cases of virgin births --
(Laughter)
we must all agree that also our second myth has taken a vital blow.
You simply cannot look a woman between her legs and read her sexual story.
NDB: Like most myths, the myths about the hymen are untrue.
There is no virgin seal that magically disappears after sex, and half of virgins can easily have sex without bleeding.
We wish we could say that by removing these myths, everything would be OK, that shame, harm and honor killings would all just disappear.
But of course, it's not that simple.
Sexual oppression of women comes from something much deeper than a simple anatomical misunderstanding about the properties of the hymen.
It's a question of cultural and religious control of women's sexuality.
And that is much harder to change.
But we must try.
ESD: As medical professionals, this is our contribution.
We want every girl, parent and [future] husband to know what the hymen is and how it works.
We want them to know that the hymen can't be used as a proof of virginity.
And that way, we can remove one of the most powerful tools used to control young women today.
After telling you this, you may wonder what the alternative is, for if we cannot use the hymen as a proof of virginity for women, then what should we use?
We opt for using nothing.
(Cheering)
If you --
If you really want to know if a woman is a virgin or not, ask her.
(Laughter)
But how she answers that question is her choice.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My name is Stuart Duncan, but I'm actually probably better known online as "AutismFather." That's me on the internet.
I know the resemblance is uncanny.
(Laughter)
But I'm going to talk a little bit today about Minecraft.
That's my Minecraft character.
If you don't know the game very well, don't worry too much about it.
It's just the medium that I used at the time to fill a need.
And what I want to talk about applies to pretty much every situation.
So about four years ago, I started a Minecraft server for children with autism and their families, and I called it "Autcraft." And since then, we've been in the news all around the world, on television and radio and magazines.
Buzzfeed called us "one of the best places on the internet." We're also the subject of an award-winning research paper called "Appropriating Minecraft as an Assistive Technology for Youth with Autism." It's a bit of a mouthful.
But you get the idea, I think.
So I want to talk a little bit about that research paper and what it's about, but first I have to give you a little bit of history on how the server came to be.
Back in 2013, everybody was playing Minecraft, kids and adults alike, with and without autism, of course.
But it was the big thing.
But I saw parents on social media reaching out to other parents, asking if their autistic children could play together.
And the reason is that when they tried to play on public servers, they kept running into bullies and trolls.
When you have autism, you behave a little differently sometimes, sometimes a lot differently.
And we all know a little bit of difference is all you really need for a bully to make you their next target.
So these terrible, terrible people online, they would destroy everything that they tried to make, they would steal all their stuff, and they would kill them over and over again, making the game virtually unplayable.
But the worst part, the part that really hurt the most, was what these bullies would say to these kids.
They'd call them rejects and defects and retards.
And they would tell these kids, some as young as six years old, that society doesn't want them, and their own parents never wanted a broken child, so they should just kill themselves.
And of course, these kids, you understand, they would sign off from these servers angry and hurt.
They would break their keyboards, they'd quite literally hate themselves, and their parents felt powerless to do anything.
So I decided I had to try and help.
I have autism, my oldest son has autism, and both my kids and I love Minecraft, so I have to do something.
So I got myself a Minecraft server, and I spent some time, built a little village with some roads and a big welcome sign and this guy and a lodge up on a mountaintop, and tried to make it inviting.
The idea was pretty simple.
I had a white list, so only people that I approved could join, and I would just monitor the server as much as I could, just to make sure that nothing went wrong.
And that was it, that was the whole promise: to keep the kids safe so they could play.
When it was done, I went to Facebook and posted a pretty simple message to my friends list, not publicly.
I wanted to see if there was any interest in this, and if it really could help.
Turns out that I greatly underestimated just how much this was needed, because within 48 hours, I got 750 emails.
I don't have that many Facebook friends.
(Laughter)
Within eight days, I had to upgrade the hosting package eight times, from the bottom package to the most expensive package they had, and now, almost four years later, I have 8,000 names on the white list from all around the world.
But the reason I'm up here today to talk to you isn't just because I gave kids a safe place to play.
It's what happened while they played.
I started hearing from parents who said their children were learning to read and write by playing on the server.
At first they spelled things by sound, like most kids do, but because they were part of a community, they saw other people spelling the same words properly and just picked it up.
I started hearing from parents who said that their nonverbal children were starting to speak.
They only talked about Minecraft, but they were talking.
(Laughter)
Some kids made friends at school for the first time ever.
Some started to share, even give things to other people. It was amazing. And every single parent came to me and said it was because of Autcraft, because of what you're doing.
But why, though? How could all of this be just from a video game server?
Well, it goes back to that research paper I was talking about.
In it, she covers some of the guidelines I used when I created the server, guidelines that I think help encourage people to be their very best. I hope. For example, communication. It can be tough for kids with autism.
It could be tough for grown-ups without autism.
But I think that kids should not be punished, they should be talked to.
Nine times out of ten, when the kids on the server act out, it's because of something that's happened in the day at school or home.
Maybe a pet died.
Sometimes it's just a miscommunication between two kids.
One doesn't say what they're about to do.
And so we just offer to help.
We always tell the children on the server that we're not mad, and they're not in trouble; we only want to help.
And it shows that not only do we care, but we respect them enough to listen to their point of view.
Respect goes a long way.
Plus, it shows them that they have everything they need to be able to resolve these problems on their own in the future and maybe even avoid them, because, you know, communication.
On most servers, as video games are, children are rewarded, well, players are rewarded, for how well they do in a competition, right?
The better you do, the better reward you get.
That can be automated; the server does the work, the code is there.
On Autcraft, we don't do that.
We have things like "Player of the Week" and "CBAs," which is "Caught Being Awesome."
(Laughter)
We award players ranks on the servers based on the attributes they exhibit, such as the "Buddy" rank for people who are friendly towards others, and "Junior Helper" for people that are helpful towards others. We have "Senior Helper" for the adults.
But they're obvious, right?
Like, people know what to expect and how to earn these things because of how they're named.
As soon as somebody signs onto the server, they know that they're going to be rewarded for who they are and not what they can do.
Our top award, the AutismFather Sword, which is named after me because I'm the founder, is a very powerful sword that you can't get in the game any other way than to show that you completely put the community above yourself, and that compassion and kindness is at the core of who you are.
We've given away quite a few of those swords, actually.
I figure, if we're watching the server to make sure nothing bad happens, we should also watch for the good things that happen and reward people for them.
We're always trying to show all the players that everybody is considered to be equal, even me.
But we know we can't treat people equally to do that.
Some of the players get angry very easily.
Some of them have additional struggles on top of autism, such as OCD or Tourette's.
So, I have this knack of remembering all of the players.
I remember their first day, the conversations we've had, things we've talked about, things they've built.
So when somebody comes to me with a problem, I handle that situation differently than I would with any other player, based on what I know about them.
For the other admins and helpers, we document everything so that, whether it's good or bad or a concerning conversation, it's there, so everybody is aware.
I want to give you one example of this one player.
He was with us for a little while, but at some point he started spamming dashes in the chat, like a big long line of dashes all the way across the screen.
A little while later, he'd do it again.
The other players asked him not to do that, and he'd say, "OK." And then he'd do it again. It started to frustrate the other players.
They asked me to mute him or to punish him for breaking the rules, but I knew there had to be something more to it.
So I went to his aunt, who is the contact that I have for him.
She explained that he had gone blind in one eye and was losing his vision in the other.
So what he was doing was splitting up the chat into easier-to-see blocks of text, which is pretty smart.
So that very same night, I talked to a friend of mine who writes code and we created a brand-new plug-in for the server that makes it so that any player on the server, including him, of course, could just enter a command and instantly have every single line separated by dashes. Plus, they can make it asterisks or blank lines or anything they want -- whatever works best for them.
We even went a little bit extra and made it so it highlights your name, so that it's easier to see if somebody mentions you.
It's just one example of how doing a little bit extra, a small modification, still helps everybody be on equal footing, even though you did a little extra just for that one player.
The big one is to be not afraid.
The children on my server are not afraid.
They are free to just be themselves, and it's because we support and encourage and celebrate each other.
We all know what it feels like to be the outcast and to be hated simply for existing, and so when we're together on the server, we're not afraid anymore.
For the first two years or so on the server, I talked to two children per week on average that were suicidal.
But they came to me because I'm the one that made them feel safe.
They felt like I was the only person in the world they could talk to.
So I guess my message is: whether you have a charity or some other organization, or you're a teacher or a therapist or you're a parent who is just doing your very best, or you're an autistic, like I am, no matter who you are, you absolutely must help these children strip away those fears before you do anything else, because anything else is going to feel forced unless they're not afraid.
It's why positive reinforcement will always do better than any form of punishment.
They want to learn when they feel safe and happy.
It just happens naturally; they don't even try to learn.
These are words from the kids on the server to describe the server.
The one thing I would hope that you could take away is that no matter what somebody else is going through in life right now, whether they're being bullied at school or at home, if they're questioning their sexuality or even their gender, which happens a lot in the autism community, if they're feeling alone or even suicidal, you have to live your life in such a way that that person feels like they can come to and tell you.
They have to feel perfectly safe in talking to you about it.
If you want to see a group of autistic children — kids who society wrongly thinks are supposed to be antisocial and lacking in empathy — if you want to see them come together and build the most compassionate and friendly and generous community you've ever seen, the kind of place that people would write about as one of the best places on the internet, they'll do that.
I've seen it.
I'm there every day.
But they have some huge obstacles that they have to overcome to do that, and it would be really helpful to have somebody there who could help to show them that the only thing they really have to fear is self-doubt.
So I guess I'm asking you to please be that person for them, because to them, those kids -- it means everything.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm an ocean microbiologist at the University of Tennessee, and I want to tell you guys about some microbes that are so strange and wonderful that they're challenging our assumptions about what life is like on Earth.
So I have a question. Please raise your hand if you've ever thought it would be cool to go to the bottom of the ocean in a submarine? Yes. Most of you, because the oceans are so cool.
Alright, now -- please raise your hand if the reason you raised your hand to go to the bottom of the ocean is because it would get you a little bit closer to that exciting mud that's down there.
(Laughter)
Nobody. I'm the only one in this room.
Well, I think about this all the time.
I spend most of my waking hours trying to determine how deep we can go into the Earth and still find something, anything, that's alive, because we still don't know the answer to this very basic question about life on Earth.
So in the 1980s, a scientist named John Parkes, in the UK, was similarly obsessed, and he came up with a crazy idea.
He believed that there was a vast, deep, and living microbial biosphere underneath all the world's oceans that extends hundreds of meters into the seafloor, which is cool, but the only problem is that nobody believed him, and the reason that nobody believed him is that ocean sediments may be the most boring place on Earth.
(Laughter)
There's no sunlight, there's no oxygen, and perhaps worst of all, there's no fresh food deliveries for literally millions of years.
You don't have to have a PhD in biology to know that that is a bad place to go looking for life.
But in 2002, [Steven D'Hondt] had convinced enough people that he was on to something that he actually got an expedition on this drillship, called the JOIDES Resolution.
And he ran it along with Bo Barker Jørgensen of Denmark.
And so they were finally able to get good pristine deep subsurface samples some really without contamination from surface microbes.
This drill ship is capable of drilling thousands of meters underneath the ocean, and the mud comes up in sequential cores, one after the other -- long, long cores that look like this.
This is being carried by scientists such as myself who go on these ships, and we process the cores on the ships and then we send them home to our home laboratories for further study.
So when John and his colleagues got these first precious deep-sea pristine samples, they put them under the microscope, and they saw images that looked pretty much like this, which is actually taken from a more recent expedition by my PhD student, Joy Buongiorno.
You can see the hazy stuff in the background. That's mud. That's deep-sea ocean mud, and the bright green dots stained with the green fluorescent dye are real, living microbes.
Now I've got to tell you something really tragic about microbes.
They all look the same under a microscope, I mean, to a first approximation.
You can take the most fascinating organisms in the world, like a microbe that literally breathes uranium, and another one that makes rocket fuel, mix them up with some ocean mud, put them underneath a microscope, and they're just little dots.
It's really annoying.
So we can't use their looks to tell them apart.
We have to use DNA, like a fingerprint, to say who is who.
And I'll teach you guys how to do it right now.
So I made up some data, and I'm going to show you some data that are not real.
This is to illustrate what it would look like if a bunch of species were not related to each other at all.
So you can see each species has a list of combinations of A, G, C and T, which are the four sub-units of DNA, sort of randomly jumbled, and nothing looks like anything else, and these species are totally unrelated to each other.
But this is what real DNA looks like, from a gene that these species happen to share.
Everything lines up nearly perfectly.
The chances of getting so many of those vertical columns where every species has a C or every species has a T, by random chance, are infinitesimal.
So we know that all those species had to have had a common ancestor.
They're all relatives of each other.
So now I'll tell you who they are.
The top two are us and chimpanzees, which y'all already knew were related, because, I mean, obviously.
(Laughter)
But we're also related to things that we don't look like, like pine trees and Giardia, which is that gastrointestinal disease you can get if you don't filter your water while you're hiking.
We're also related to bacteria like E. coli and Clostridium difficile, which is a horrible, opportunistic pathogen that kills lots of people.
But there's of course good microbes too, like Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, which cleans up our industrial waste for us.
So if I take these DNA sequences, and then I use them, the similarities and differences between them, to make a family tree for all of us so you can see who is closely related, then this is what it looks like.
So you can see clearly, at a glance, that things like us and Giardia and bunnies and pine trees are all, like, siblings, and then the bacteria are like our ancient cousins.
But we're kin to every living thing on Earth.
So in my job, on a daily basis, I get to produce scientific evidence against existential loneliness.
So when we got these first DNA sequences, from the first cruise, of pristine samples from the deep subsurface, we wanted to know where they were.
So the first thing that we discovered is that they were not aliens, because we could get their DNA to line up with everything else on Earth.
But now check out where they go on our tree of life.
The first thing you'll notice is that there's a lot of them.
It wasn't just one little species that managed to live in this horrible place.
It's kind of a lot of things.
And the second thing that you'll notice, hopefully, is that they're not like anything we've ever seen before.
They are as different from each other as they are from anything that we've known before as we are from pine trees.
So John Parkes was completely correct.
He, and we, had discovered a completely new and highly diverse microbial ecosystem on Earth that no one even knew existed before the 1980s. So now we were on a roll.
The next step was to grow these exotic species in a petri dish so that we could do real experiments on them like microbiologists are supposed to do.
But no matter what we fed them, they refused to grow.
Even now, 15 years and many expeditions later, no human has ever gotten a single one of these exotic deep subsurface microbes to grow in a petri dish.
And it's not for lack of trying.
That may sound disappointing, but I actually find it exhilarating, because it means there are so many tantalizing unknowns to work on.
Like, my colleagues and I got what we thought was a really great idea.
We were going to read their genes like a recipe book, find out what it was they wanted to eat and put it in their petri dishes, and then they would grow and be happy.
But when we looked at their genes, it turns out that what they wanted to eat was the food we were already feeding them.
So that was a total wash.
There was something else that they wanted in their petri dishes that we were just not giving them.
So by combining measurements from many different places around the world, my colleagues at the University of Southern California, Doug LaRowe and Jan Amend, were able to calculate that each one of these deep-sea microbial cells requires only one zeptowatt of power, and before you get your phones out, a zepto is 10 to the minus 21, because I know I would want to look that up.
Humans, on the other hand, require about 100 watts of power.
So 100 watts is basically if you take a pineapple and drop it from about waist height to the ground 881,632 times a day.
If you did that and then linked it up to a turbine, that would create enough power to make me happen for a day.
A zeptowatt, if you put it in similar terms, is if you take just one grain of salt and then you imagine a tiny, tiny, little ball that is one thousandth of the mass of that one grain of salt and then you drop it one nanometer, which is a hundred times smaller than the wavelength of visible light, once per day.
That's all it takes to make these microbes live.
That's less energy than we ever thought would be capable of supporting life, but somehow, amazingly, beautifully, it's enough.
So if these deep-subsurface microbes have a very different relationship with energy than we previously thought, then it follows that they'll have to have a different relationship with time as well, because when you live on such tiny energy gradients, rapid growth is impossible.
If these things wanted to colonize our throats and make us sick, they would get muscled out by fast-growing streptococcus before they could even initiate cell division.
So that's why we never find them in our throats.
Perhaps the fact that the deep subsurface is so boring is actually an asset to these microbes.
They never get washed out by a storm.
They never get overgrown by weeds.
All they have to do is exist.
Maybe that thing that we were missing in our petri dishes was not food at all.
Maybe it wasn't a chemical.
Maybe the thing that they really want, the nutrient that they want, is time.
But time is the one thing that I'll never be able to give them.
So even if I have a cell culture that I pass to my PhD students, who pass it to their PhD students, and so on, we'd have to do that for thousands of years in order to mimic the exact conditions of the deep subsurface, all without growing any contaminants. It's just not possible. But maybe in a way we already have grown them in our petri dishes.
Maybe they looked at all that food we offered them and said, "Thanks, I'm going to speed up so much that I'm going to make a new cell next century. Ugh.
(Laughter)
So why is it that the rest of biology moves so fast?
Why does a cell die after a day and a human dies after only a hundred years?
These seem like really arbitrarily short limits when you think about the total amount of time in the universe.
But these are not arbitrary limits.
They're dictated by one simple thing, and that thing is the Sun.
Once life figured out how to harness the energy of the Sun through photosynthesis, we all had to speed up and get on day and night cycles.
In that way, the Sun gave us both a reason to be fast and the fuel to do it.
You can view most of life on Earth like a circulatory system, and the Sun is our beating heart.
But the deep subsurface is like a circulatory system that's completely disconnected from the Sun.
It's instead being driven by long, slow geological rhythms.
There's currently no theoretical limit on the lifespan of one single cell.
As long as there is at least a tiny energy gradient to exploit, theoretically, a single cell could live for hundreds of thousands of years or more, simply by replacing broken parts over time.
To ask a microbe that lives like that to grow in our petri dishes is to ask them to adapt to our frenetic, Sun-centric, fast way of living, and maybe they've got better things to do than that.
(Laughter)
Imagine if we could figure out how they managed to do this.
What if it involves some cool, ultra-stable compounds that we could use to increase the shelf life in biomedical or industrial applications?
Or maybe if we figure out the mechanism that they use to grow so extraordinarily slowly, we could mimic it in cancer cells and slow runaway cell division.
I don't know.
I mean, honestly, that is all speculation, but the only thing I know for certain is that there are a hundred billion billion billlion living microbial cells underlying all the world's oceans.
That's 200 times more than the total biomass of humans on this planet.
And those microbes have a fundamentally different relationship with time and energy than we do.
What seems like a day to them might be a thousand years to us.
They don't care about the Sun, and they don't care about growing fast, and they probably don't give a damn about my petri dishes ...
(Laughter)
but if we can continue to find creative ways to study them, then maybe we'll finally figure out what life, all of life, is like on Earth.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to introduce you to my badass friends.
Meet Thelma and Louise.
(Laughter)
I'm passionate about cows.
And although they've been getting a lot of crap lately due to methane emissions and climate change, I hope that I can redeem their reputation in part by showing you how incredibly important they are in solving one of the world's biggest problems: food security.
But more importantly, for Africa -- it's resultant childhood stunting.
Nutritional stunting manifests itself in a reduction of growth rate in human development.
And according to UNICEF, stunting doesn't come easy.
It doesn't come quickly.
It happens over a long period of time during which a child endures painful and debilitating cycles of illness, depressed appetite, insufficient nutrition and inadequate care.
And most kids simply can't endure such rigors.
But those that do survive, they carry forward long-term cognitive problems as well as losses of stature.
The numbers of stunted children under the age of five, in most regions of the world, has been declining.
And I really hate to say this, but the only place where they haven't been declining is here, in Africa.
Here, 59 million children, three in 10 in that age group, struggle to meet their genetic potential -- their full genetic potential.
Protein is one of our most important dietary requirements, and evidence shows that lack of essential amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, in young children's diets, can result in stunting.
Essential amino acids are called essential because we can't synthesize them in our bodies.
We have to get them from our foods and the best sources are animal-derived: milk, meat and eggs.
Most protein consumed on the African continent is crop-based.
And although we have millions of smallholder farmers rearing animals, livestock production is not as easy as we think.
The big livestock gaps between rich countries and poor countries are due to poor animal health.
Endemic livestock diseases, some of them transmissible to humans, threaten not only livestock producers in those poor countries, but all human health across all countries.
This is a global pathogens network.
It shows the pathogens found across the world according to the Enhanced Infectious Diseases database.
And it shows those pathogens that share hosts.
In a nutshell, we share pathogens, and thus diseases, with the species we live closest to: our livestock.
And we call these zoonotic diseases.
Recent reports show that the deadly dozen zoonotic diseases kill 2.2 million people and sicken 2.4 billion people annually.
And Jimmy says, "The greatest burden of zoonoses falls on one billion poor livestock keepers."
We totally underestimate the importance of our smallholder farmers.
We're beginning to recognize how important they are and how they influence our medical health, our biosafety and more recently, our cognitive and our physical health.
They stand at the frontline of zoonotic epidemics.
They pretty much underpin our existence.
And they need to know so much, yet most lack knowledge on livestock disease prevention and treatment.
So how do they learn? Apart from shared experiences, trial and error, conventional farming extension services are boots on the ground and radio -- expensive and hard to scale in the face of population growth.
Sounds pretty gloomy, doesn't it?
But we're at an interesting point in Africa.
We're changing that narrative using innovative solutions, riding across scalable technologies.
Knowledge doesn't have to be expensive.
My company developed an agricultural platform called iCow.
We teach farmers best livestock practices using SMS over simple, low-end phones.
Farmers receive three SMSs a week on best livestock practices, and those that execute the messages go on to see increases in productivity within as short a time as three months.
The first increases in productivity, of course, are improved animal health.
We use SMS because it is retentive.
Farmers store their messages, they write them down in books, and in effect, we're drip-feeding agricultural manuals into the fields.
We recognize that we are all part of the global food network: producers and consumers, you and me, and every farmer.
We're focusing now on trying to bring together producers and consumers to take action and take responsibility for not only food security, but for food safety.
This beautiful animal is an African-Asian Sahiwal crossed with a Dutch Fleckvieh.
She's milkier than her Sahiwal mom, and she's sturdier and more resistant to disease than her Fleckvieh father.
In Ethiopia and Tanzania, the African Dairy Genetic Gains program is using SMS and cutting-edge genomics and pioneering Africa's first tropically adapted dairy breeding centers and dairy performance recording centers.
Farmers contribute their production data -- milking records, breeding records and feeding records -- to the ADGG platform.
This stage is synthesized through algorithms from some of the top livestock institutions in the world before it lands back in the farmers' hands in actionable SMSs.
Customized data, customized responses all aimed at increasing productivity based on the potential on the ground.
We're at a very interesting place in agriculture in Africa.
By the end of this year, we'll have almost one billion mobile phone subscriptions.
We have the power in our hands to ensure that livestock production systems are not only healthy, productive and profitable, but that farmers are knowledgeable, and more importantly, that our farmers are safe.
Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways to guarantee food security.
Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways to guarantee each and every child their full opportunity and ability to reach their full genetic potential.
And harnessing the power of millions of smallholder farmers and their badass cows like mine, we should be able to bring a halt to stunting in Africa.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Hello, everyone.
Sawubona.
In South Africa, where I come from, "sawubona" is the Zulu word for "hello." There's a beautiful and powerful intention behind the word because "sawubona" literally translated means, "I see you, and by seeing you, I bring you into being." So beautiful, imagine being greeted like that.
But what does it take in the way we see ourselves?
Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories that help us to thrive in an increasingly complex and fraught world?
This crucial question has been at the center of my life's work.
Because how we deal with our inner world drives everything.
Every aspect of how we love, how we live, how we parent and how we lead.
The conventional view of emotions as good or bad, positive or negative, is rigid.
And rigidity in the face of complexity is toxic.
We need greater levels of emotional agility for true resilience and thriving.
My journey with this calling began not in the hallowed halls of a university, but in the messy, tender business of life.
I grew up in the white suburbs of apartheid South Africa, a country and community committed to not seeing. To denial. It's denial that makes 50 years of racist legislation possible while people convince themselves that they are doing nothing wrong.
And yet, I first learned of the destructive power of denial at a personal level, before I understood what it was doing to the country of my birth.
My father died on a Friday.
He was 42 years old and I was 15.
My mother whispered to me to go and say goodbye to my father before I went to school.
So I put my backpack down and walked the passage that ran through to where the heart of our home my father lay dying of cancer.
His eyes were closed, but he knew I was there.
In his presence, I had always felt seen.
I told him I loved him, said goodbye and headed off for my day.
At school, I drifted from science to mathematics to history to biology, as my father slipped from the world.
From May to July to September to November, I went about with my usual smile.
I didn't drop a single grade.
When asked how I was doing, I would shrug and say, "OK." I was praised for being strong.
I was the master of being OK.
But back home, we struggled -- my father hadn't been able to keep his small business going during his illness.
And my mother, alone, was grieving the love of her life trying to raise three children, and the creditors were knocking.
We felt, as a family, financially and emotionally ravaged.
And I began to spiral down, isolated, fast.
I started to use food to numb my pain. Binging and purging. Refusing to accept the full weight of my grief.
No one knew, and in a culture that values relentless positivity, I thought that no one wanted to know.
But one person did not buy into my story of triumph over grief.
My eighth-grade English teacher fixed me with burning blue eyes as she handed out blank notebooks.
She said, "Write what you're feeling. Tell the truth. Write like nobody's reading." And just like that, I was invited to show up authentically to my grief and pain.
It was a simple act but nothing short of a revolution for me.
It was this revolution that started in this blank notebook 30 years ago that shaped my life's work.
The secret, silent correspondence with myself.
Like a gymnast, I started to move beyond the rigidity of denial into what I've now come to call emotional agility.
Life's beauty is inseparable from its fragility.
We are young until we are not.
We walk down the streets sexy until one day we realize that we are unseen.
We nag our children and one day realize that there is silence where that child once was, now making his or her way in the world.
We are healthy until a diagnosis brings us to our knees.
The only certainty is uncertainty, and yet we are not navigating this frailty successfully or sustainably.
The World Health Organization tells us that depression is now the single leading cause of disability globally -- outstripping cancer, outstripping heart disease.
And at a time of greater complexity, unprecedented technological, political and economic change, we are seeing how people's tendency is more and more to lock down into rigid responses to their emotions.
On the one hand we might obsessively brood on our feelings.
Getting stuck inside our heads. Hooked on being right. Or victimized by our news feed.
On the other, we might bottle our emotions, pushing them aside and permitting only those emotions deemed legitimate.
In a survey I recently conducted with over 70,000 people, I found that a third of us -- a third -- either judge ourselves for having so-called "bad emotions," like sadness, anger or even grief.
Or actively try to push aside these feelings.
We do this not only to ourselves, but also to people we love, like our children -- we may inadvertently shame them out of emotions seen as negative, jump to a solution, and fail to help them to see these emotions as inherently valuable.
Normal, natural emotions are now seen as good or bad.
And being positive has become a new form of moral correctness.
People with cancer are automatically told to just stay positive.
Women, to stop being so angry.
And the list goes on.
It's a tyranny.
It's a tyranny of positivity.
And it's cruel. Unkind. And ineffective. And we do it to ourselves, and we do it to others.
If there's one common feature of brooding, bottling or false positivity, it's this: they are all rigid responses.
And if there's a single lesson we can learn from the inevitable fall of apartheid it is that rigid denial doesn't work. It's unsustainable. For individuals, for families, for societies.
And as we watch the ice caps melt, it is unsustainable for our planet.
Research on emotional suppression shows that when emotions are pushed aside or ignored, they get stronger.
Psychologists call this amplification.
Like that delicious chocolate cake in the refrigerator -- the more you try to ignore it ...
(Laughter)
the greater its hold on you.
You might think you're in control of unwanted emotions when you ignore them, but in fact they control you.
Internal pain always comes out. Always. And who pays the price? We do. Our children, our colleagues, our communities.
Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not anti-happiness.
I like being happy.
I'm a pretty happy person.
But when we push aside normal emotions to embrace false positivity, we lose our capacity to develop skills to deal with the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.
I've had hundreds of people tell me what they don't want to feel.
They say things like, "I don't want to try because I don't want to feel disappointed." Or, "I just want this feeling to go away."
"I understand," I say to them. "But you have dead people's goals."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Only dead people never get unwanted or inconvenienced by their feelings.
(Laughter)
Only dead people never get stressed, never get broken hearts, never experience the disappointment that comes with failure.
Tough emotions are part of our contract with life.
You don't get to have a meaningful career or raise a family or leave the world a better place without stress and discomfort.
Discomfort is the price of admission to a meaningful life.
So, how do we begin to dismantle rigidity and embrace emotional agility?
As that young schoolgirl, when I leaned into those blank pages, I started to do away with feelings of what I should be experiencing.
And instead started to open my heart to what I did feel. Pain. And grief. And loss. And regret.
Research now shows that the radical acceptance of all of our emotions -- even the messy, difficult ones -- is the cornerstone to resilience, thriving, and true, authentic happiness.
But emotional agility is more that just an acceptance of emotions.
We also know that accuracy matters.
In my own research, I found that words are essential.
We often use quick and easy labels to describe our feelings. "I'm stressed" is the most common one I hear.
But there's a world of difference between stress and disappointment or stress and that knowing dread of "I'm in the wrong career." When we label our emotions accurately, we are more able to discern the precise cause of our feelings.
And what scientists call the readiness potential in our brain is activated, allowing us to take concrete steps.
But not just any steps -- the right steps for us.
Because our emotions are data.
Our emotions contain flashing lights to things that we care about.
We tend not to feel strong emotion to stuff that doesn't mean anything in our worlds.
If you feel rage when you read the news, that rage is a signpost, perhaps, that you value equity and fairness -- and an opportunity to take active steps to shape your life in that direction.
When we are open to the difficult emotions, we are able to generate responses that are values-aligned.
But there's an important caveat. Emotions are data, they are not directives.
We can show up to and mine our emotions for their values without needing to listen to them.
Just like I can show up to my son in his frustration with his baby sister -- but not endorse his idea that he gets to give her away to the first stranger he sees in a shopping mall.
(Laughter)
We own our emotions, they don't own us.
When we internalize the difference between how I feel in all my wisdom and what I do in a values-aligned action, we generate the pathway to our best selves via our emotions.
So, what does this look like in practice?
When you feel a strong, tough emotion, don't race for the emotional exits.
Learn its contours, show up to the journal of your hearts.
What is the emotion telling you?
And try not to say "I am," as in, "I'm angry" or "I'm sad." When you say "I am" it makes you sound as if you are the emotion.
Whereas you are you, and the emotion is a data source.
Instead, try to notice the feeling for what it is: "I'm noticing that I'm feeling sad" or "I'm noticing that I'm feeling angry." These are essential skills for us, our families, our communities.
They're also critical to the workplace.
In my research, when I looked at what helps people to bring the best of themselves to work, I found a powerful key contributor: individualized consideration.
When people are allowed to feel their emotional truth, engagement, creativity and innovation flourish in the organization.
Diversity isn't just people, it's also what's inside people.
Including diversity of emotion.
The most agile, resilient individuals, teams, organizations, families, communities are built on an openness to the normal human emotions.
It's this that allows us to say, "What is my emotion telling me?" "Which action will bring me towards my values?" "Which will take me away from my values?" Emotional agility is the ability to be with your emotions with curiosity, compassion, and especially the courage to take values-connected steps.
When I was little, I would wake up at night terrified by the idea of death.
My father would comfort me with soft pats and kisses.
But he would never lie. "We all die, Susie," he would say. "It's normal to be scared." He didn't try to invent a buffer between me and reality.
It took me a while to understand the power of how he guided me through those nights.
What he showed me is that courage is not an absence of fear; courage is fear walking.
Neither of us knew that in 10 short years, he would be gone.
And that time for each of us is all too precious and all too brief.
But when our moment comes to face our fragility, in that ultimate time, it will ask us, "Are you agile?" "Are you agile?" Let the moment be an unreserved "yes." A "yes" born of a lifelong correspondence with your own heart.
And in seeing yourself.
Sawubona. Because in seeing yourself, you are also able to see others, too: the only sustainable way forward in a fragile, beautiful world.
And thank you.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
There's something really incredible happening.
So there's over a billion people who have no access to energy whatsoever across the world, 620 million of them here in Africa.
It costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid.
If you are going to wait for it, it takes about nine years, on average, and that feels like a lifetime when you're trying to make that happen.
That's kind of unbelievable, and it's also unacceptable.
So let's do something about it.
The lightbulb comes from this idea that you have an energy system that's made up of the ideas of Tesla and the ideas of Thomas Edison.
There was an evolution that said it's not just about the lightbulb, it's about the whole system, the whole energy system that goes with that lightbulb, and what happened in that gilded age was the creation of an industrial system that every country around the world has now started to emulate.
So to get to the appliances, you need to have power stations.
From power stations, you need to have infrastructure, and that infrastructure takes you to the point of having electricity, and you get to the lightbulbs and the appliances that we all take for granted.
But the amazing thing, in a way, is that there's a revolution happening in the villages and towns all around us here in East Africa.
And the revolution is an echo of the cell phone revolution.
It's wireless, and that revolution is about solar and it's about distributed solar.
Photons are wireless, they fall on every rooftop, and they generate enough power to be sufficient for every household need.
So that's an incredible thing.
There's also a problem with it.
Up until now, the technology hasn't been there to make it happen, and the mindset has been that we have to have the grid to provide industrial growth and let countries develop and create jobs and industrialize.
So we've gotten ourselves to the point where actually the costs of building these grids and following that pattern of development are really unsustainable.
If you add up the deficits that all of the utilities run in Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, you get to a number of 21 billion dollars every year to maintain that system and keep it going.
So an extraordinary amount of resources that's been put in to creating a system that ultimately we will have to wait a very long time for, and when it comes, it often doesn't come with sufficient robustness to allow us to go down that path to development.
So what a shame.
But here's what's happening, and here's the opportunity that I think we should all get excited about.
So there's a group of companies that have been chipping away at this problem over the last 10 years, and this group of companies have recognized the reality that there's a great big nuclear reactor up there in the sky, and that Africa is more endowed with that solar power that comes from the sky, the sun, than almost any other continent.
So the opportunity has come to convert some of that solar power, wireless power, into energy at the household level.
And three things have happened at the same time.
First, the costs of solar productivity have come down.
So putting a panel on your roof and generating power from it, that cost has absolutely collapsed over the last 30 years, and it's gone down by 95 percent.
Second, the appliance network.
So the group of appliances that we've all gotten used to, we all want and we all need, we all see as part of our everyday lives that give us health and security, those appliances have come down in cost.
So if you take the LED lightbulb, for example, a very simple thing, they're now 85 percent less than they were five years ago, and their efficiency, when you compare them to an incandescent bulb, like the lightbulb I showed in the previous slide, is incredible.
They give you 10 times the amount of light, and they last 30 times as long.
And then the last thing that's happened is of course the cell phone revolution, so we're piggybacking off the cell phone revolution, and we can now make decentralized customers make small payments for bits of equipment and appliances where actually they're now affordable.
We can pay them off over a daily or a weekly schedule.
So this is an incredible change in the economy that's happening, and it's really opened up something very, very innovative.
So I'm going to introduce you to a lady I met with last week.
Her name's Susan.
It may not look like it, but Susan is a representative of a $27 billion market.
27 billion dollars is what people like Susan spend every year on cell phone charging, flashlight batteries and kerosene to light their homes.
So Susan is a proud owner of a small solar system.
It's a kit rather than a planetary thing, so a small solar system, and her small solar system allows her to have a couple of lightbulbs, and she's made this transition, this jump, from kerosene into light.
She has four or five lights and a radio.
It's fantastic, and she talks about it.
She talks about her kids doing homework at night because she has light.
I'm not sure what the kids feel about that.
She talks about the fact that she can go out at 4am and look after the cows, and she's not so worried, but also, with a little twinkle in her eye, she talks about how light turns her house into a home at night.
She's not scared of her own house at night, because it has light in it, and I thought that was amazing.
So Susan does something that many customers of these companies that I talked about do, and she forces us to innovate.
She challenges companies, saying, "I've got the radio and the lights. You know what? I'd like a TV.
I'd like to entertain, educate me and my kids.
And then I would like to have some hair clippers for my kids, you know, to cut my kids' hair, and I'd love to have a fridge.
And she's coined something that the energy world is really hungry to do.
The idea that she's coined is the energy ladder.
It starts, again, with a lightbulb. Right? And the lightbulb is an idea that we can get our kids to do homework, and very cheap, about five dollars, and we can get it distributed.
But then let's go up from there. This is the kit that Susan has: four lightbulbs, radio, maybe a little flashlight, a little solar panel on the roof.
And then let's go up again.
We can get maybe at about 500 dollars, the previous kit was maybe $150, again, paid for over time, two years to pay it all off, you can get the TV, so the lightbulbs and the TV.
And you start to ask yourself, "So where is this headed?" Is this headed here, where we can have distributed systems with the right infrastructure to provide power for our hospitals and our schools?
And really how far can this go?
And this is the mindset shift that I think is really exciting.
How far can we go?
Could it get up to here?
You know, this is the conceptual design for one of the world's biggest factories, designed to be fully solar-powered and fully off grid.
Maybe we can get that.
So there's a generation of these companies that are out there doing this work and creating thousands of jobs, creating, selling, tens of thousands of these solar systems, so bringing tens of thousands of families into light, and tackling that big $1 billion problem that I talked about at the beginning, and really innovating.
And what they're doing is, they're not only energy companies, they're also credit finance companies, so they're bringing people into an economy.
They're retail companies, so they're taking products out to people in the connecting markets.
And they're appliance companies, so they're developing extraordinary products that are very efficient and very cheap.
So an extraordinary thing is happening out there that's worth recognizing.
And where does it take us?
From a governmental perspective, from a social perspective, it takes us out to two really big goals.
We aspire towards energy access for everybody, and we aspire towards a fully-functioning low-carbon economy.
And we're getting to the point where we're seeing the fully-functioning low-carbon economy is not just about getting people onto the grid, it's about getting people onto electricity and doing it in a way that's really dignified.
So I want us all to picture it for a moment, really picture what this could mean: [New energy ecosystem] an energy system that's not just about subsistence power, getting the family off the kerosene, but it's actually the full suite of appliances and tools and productivity that we've all gotten used to, so actually energy at a scale that can drive industrial development. And it's the ability to have powerful tools.
It's the ability to be productive in the households, as a farmer, or as a carpenter or as a tailor and get your businesses to work and bring you into the economy.
And I was working again a couple of days ago with a farmer just outside of Nairobi, small field, and he has an irrigation pump that's run off solar, and he was bragging about how much of a difference it made to his productivity.
When we were listening to him, we were asking ourselves, at what point will it be that actually, you will be charging an electric scooter off your rooftop and taking your crops to market with mobility that you've charged yourself, using your own power?
And that's an extraordinary thing that's happening, and if you listen to Susan and Francis, you get to this point where you say, "These guys have this extraordinary sense of dignity about the way they're achieving their power, the sense of ownership and the sense of pride, and I'm going to flip into a little tiny video clip, which is from a distributor of one of these companies that I'm talking about.
And he puts it better than anyone I've ever heard it. So just listen to this.
Martin: So if it does happen that we get to a point where every home has their own independent supply of energy, that will give us the democracy of energy. That's it. And everybody has that choice, and everybody knows when they want to switch it on or off, whether they want to sell access or whether they want to store it.
That freedom getting back into the hands of the consumer, that would be the most exciting thing.
Amar Inamdar: Brilliant, right?
That was Martin, and he has a really wonderful turn of phrase, and what a sense of vision that he captures.
So picture that for a moment: every household a proud producer as well as consumer of energy ... the ability to generate power, to share power, to sell power, all coming from your own generating asset sitting on your own property.
Maybe even think about crowdsourcing with your neighbors the grid from the ground up, rather than waiting for the government to bring it from the top down.
So in Africa, we have this extraordinary opportunity right now, an extraordinary opportunity, to change the world and create an energy system that everybody will be jealous of, and everybody will look to us as the innovators of.
And that's the democracy of energy.
Thank you very much. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Quick question.
So it's a really exciting vision.
Help us understand, what are the key roadblocks right now?
Like, what could make this go faster?
AI: So the first one, I think, is really the intermittency of solar power.
So the problem is that the sun only shines for 12 hours a day, so you've got darkness for 12 hours a day, and we need to have storage solutions that are better to help us take us down that path.
So storage is really one.
CA: And those prices are coming down.
AI: And those prices are coming down very quickly.
Second, the appliance set.
So it needs to get more efficient, and it needs to get more diverse.
We need to do more of the things we in Africa want to do with the appliance set.
CA: DC appliances.
AI: DC appliances, and I think there's a real opportunity there, Chris.
I think the opportunity is that we could shift some of these 21 billion dollars of subsidies that governments are spending on the current electricity system and we could promote R & amp; D here in Africa to create some of these products, to be some of these entrepreneurs, and make this happen.
So create this new system here.
CA: And some of the companies themselves, I mean, there's plenty of demand there.
What's holding them back from supplying that demand?
I mean, some of them talk about, they would like to sell 10x what they can currently sell.
AI: Exactly. So for many of these capitals, it's that markets don't price consumer risk very well, and particularly in markets like ours, in emerging markets and here in Africa.
So there's not enough working capital coming into this space because the big financiers look at this space and say, "I don't know how to price that risk, so I'm going to stay away from it." And that's holding a lot of these companies back.
CA: Well, it's incredibly exciting to picture what could happen here.
In my mind, this might be the biggest leapfrog of them all.
And thank you for all you're doing and for sharing that vision so powerfully.
My name is Mwende Katwiwa and I am a poet, a Pan-Africanist and a freedom fighter.
I was 23 years old when I first heard about Reproductive Justice.
I was working at Women with a Vision, where I learned that Reproductive Justice was defined by Sister Song as: One: A woman's right to decide if and when she will have a baby and the conditions under which she will give birth.
Two: A woman's right to decide if she will not have a baby and her options for preventing or ending a pregnancy.
And three: A woman's right to parent the children she already has in safe and healthy environments without fear of violence from individuals or the government.
I've always wanted to be a mother.
Growing up, I heard all about the joys of motherhood.
I used to dream of watching my womb weave wonder into this world.
See, I knew I was young.
But I figured,
it couldn't hurt to start planning for something so big, so early.
But now, I'm 26 years old.
And I don't know if I have what it takes to stomach motherhood in this country.
See, over the years, America has taught me more about parenting
than any book on the subject.
It has taught me how some women give birth to babies
and others to suspects.
It has taught me that this body will birth kin
who are more likely to be held in prison cells
than to hold college degrees.
There is something about being Black in America
that has made motherhood seem
complicated.
Seem like, I don't know what to do to raise my kids right
and keep them alive.
Do I tell my son not to steal because it is wrong,
or because they will use it to justify his death?
Do I tell him
that even if he pays for his Skittles and sweet tea
there will still be those who will watch him
and see a criminal before child;
who will call the police and not wait for them to come.
Do I even want the police to come?
Too many Sean Bells go off in my head when I consider calling 911.
I will not take it for Oscar Grant-ed that they will not come and kill my son.
So, we may have gotten rid of the nooses,
but I still consider it lynching when they murder Black boys
and leave their bodies for four hours in the sun.
As a historical reminder
that there is something about being Black in America
that has made motherhood sound
like mourning.
Sound like one morning I could wake up
and see my son as a repeat of last week's story.
Sound like I could wake up and realize
the death of my daughter wouldn't even be newsworthy.
So you can't tell me that Sandra Bland is the only Black woman
whose violence deserves more than our silence.
What about our other dark-skinned daughters in distress
whose deaths we have yet to remember?
What about our children
whose lives don't fit neatly between the lives of your genders?
See, apparently, nothing is a great protector
if you come out of a body that looks like this.
See, there is something about being Black in America
that has made motherhood sound
like something I'm not sure I look forward to.
I've written too many poems about dead Black children to be naïve
about the fact that there could one day be a poem written about my kids.
But I do not want to be a mother who gave birth to poems.
I do not want a stanza for a son
nor a line for a little girl
nor a footnote for a child who doesn't fit into this world.
No.
I do not want children who will live forever
in the pages of poetry,
yet can't seem to outlive
me.
(Applause)
I was invited to the TEDWomen conference to perform a poem.
But for me, poetry is not about art and performance.
It is a form of protest.
Yesterday, during rehearsal, I was told that there had been two to three recent TED Talks about Black Lives Matter.
That maybe I should cut down my TED Talk so it could "just" be about Reproductive Justice.
But that poem and this talk is fundamentally about my inability to separate the two.
I was 21 years old --
I was 21 years old when Trayvon Martin was murdered.
Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black boy, a Black child, reminded me reminded us how little this nation actually values Black life.
The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter became the most recognized call for Black people and our children to live in safe environments and healthy communities without fear from violence from individuals or the state or government.
Months later, when George Zimmerman was not held responsible for murdering Trayvon Martin, I heard Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin's mother, speak.
Her testimony so deeply impacted me that I found myself constantly asking, what would it mean to mother in the United Stated of America in this skin?
What does motherhood really mean, when for so many who look like me it is synonymous with mourning?
Without realizing it, I had begun to link the Reproductive Justice framework and the Movement for Black Lives.
As I learned more about Reproductive Justice at Women With A Vision, and as I continued to be active in the Movement for Black Lives, I found myself wanting others to see and feel these similarities.
I found myself asking: Whose job is it in times like this to connect ideas realities and people?
I want to dedicate this talk and that poem to Constance Malcolm.
She is the mother of Ramarley Graham who was another Black child who was murdered before their time.
She reminded me once over dinner, as I was struggling to write that poem, that it is the artist's job to unearth stories that people try to bury with shovels of complacency and time.
Recently, Toni Morrison wrote, "In times of dread, artists must never choose to remain silent.
There is no time for self-pity, no room for fear. "Yesterday, during rehearsal, when I was told that I should" maybe cut the Black Lives Matter portion from my talk, "I found myself fearful for a moment.
Fearful that again our stories were being denied the very stages they deserve to be told on.
"In times of dread, artists must never choose to remain silent. And then I remembered the words I had just spoken.
There is no time for self-pity,
(Applause)
There is no time for self-pity,
And no room for fear. "And I have made my choice.
And I am always choosing.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Like many of you, I'm often frustrated by the democratic process.
It's messy, it's complicated, it's often inefficient.
Our political leaders feel disconnected from the concerns of ordinary people.
Many feel that voting every few years for leaders disconnected from their daily challenges is pointless.
But before we reject democracy, let's imagine what it could be.
And I believe that African activists are redefining democracy by putting protest at its center, what I refer to as "protest democracy."
International organizations and academic experts define democracy as regular, multiparty electoral competition.
But democracy should not only be about elites competing at the ballot box.
For it to have meaning, it's something we must engage in every day.
When I say "protest democracy," I'm challenging how we think about democratic action.
Viewing democracy as only elections is no longer adequate and threatens democracy itself.
So we must protest democracy to give it a renewed meaning.
What would this look like? We need to turn to African societies, where ordinary people are increasingly taking to the streets to transform their lives.
African social movements have often been at the forefront of conceptualizing democracy in this way.
This may come as a surprise to those of who think that the only way Africans engage in politics is through the barrel of the gun.
But increasingly, young people are taking to the streets and abandoning organized violence in favor of more effective nonviolent action.
I've spent much of the past two decades talking to African activists, both violent and nonviolent.
Across Africa, young people are rising up to challenge almost every type of regime known to humanity.
This is my friend Thiat.
He's a rapper from Senegal.
He led a large movement in Senegal that was successful in preventing the president from stealing a third term.
From Morocco to Lesotho, young people are rising up against entrenched monarchies: in Egypt and Sudan, against brutal dictatorships; in Uganda and Ethiopia, against powerful militarized states with quasi-democratic veneers; in South Africa, where this image was taken, and Burundi, against democratically elected leaders who have done little to improve the conditions for ordinary people.
Across the continent, protest is not exceptional, but a normal part of life.
Africans use protests to challenge both dictators as well as power cuts.
In a way, Africans are protesting democracy itself, enriching its possibilities for us all.
There have been two major waves of African protest, and we are currently living through the third, which began around 2005.
It includes the so-called Arab Spring, which took place mostly on the continent.
The first wave took place in the 1940s and 1950s and led to Africa's decolonization.
Kwame Nkrumah led a broad coalition in Ghana that overthrew British rule, providing a template for nonviolent movements globally.
The second wave took place in the 1980s and 1990s against austerity measures that imposed harsh conditions on African economies.
These protests led to the overthrow of autocratic regimes and led to the introduction of multiparty elections across the continent.
The ongoing third wave is correcting the shortcomings of the earlier two.
If the first wave brought liberation but not democracy, and the second, elections but only for the elites, then it is the third wave that is most concerned with transforming democracy into the rule of the people.
It includes movements like Y'en a Marre in Senegal, Le Balai Citoyen in Burkina Faso, Tajamuka in Zimbabwe, LUCHA and Filimbi in the Democratic Republic of Congo, movements that work outside of more conventional nongovernmental organizations and political parties to challenge the economic and political system itself, often at great risk.
Brilliant young activists like LUCHA's Fred Bauma have been detained and tortured, often with little to no outcry from the international community.
The list goes on, as you can see from some of the data we collected.
There have been large popular protests in over 40 African countries since 2005, and if you look, you'll recognize that in 2011, the year of the so-called Arab Spring, was actually the spike of this broader wave.
Contrary to popular belief, many of these protests have been successful.
We know of the dictators falling in Tunisia and in Egypt, but popular movements have prevented presidents from stealing third terms in Senegal, in Malawi and Burkina Faso as well.
What's driving this upsurge of protest?
Demographically, Africa is both the youngest and the fastest-growing continent, with the largest age gap between the people and their rulers.
It is urbanizing at a tremendous pace.
Economically, African countries have been growing for over a decade now, largely driven by investments from Asia.
But little of this wealth is trickling down.
Formal jobs in the industrial sector are actually decreasing, with informal labor the only option left for people to eke out a living.
As a result, inequality is skyrocketing, and political leaders are increasingly disconnected from their much younger populations.
For those of us from outside of Africa, we're familiar with parts of this story: a massive spike in inequality, the product of a decline in good jobs for good wages that were once considered the hallmark of an advanced society; the capture of our political parties by elites accompanied by the hollowing out of civil society that once provided a voice to ordinary people; that sinking feeling that no matter what you do, external factors related to the global economy can disrupt our lives for the worse.
Our political leaders seem helpless, insisting on austerity, even as public goods diminish to levels unseen in decades.
And this is when they're not succumbing to exclusionary nationalism, blaming our woes on the weak rather than the powerful.
What those of us from North America and Western Europe consider to be new has been the normal condition of African life since the 1970s.
So who better to learn from than those who have been engaged in resistance to these conditions for the longest period of time?
What can we learn from African protest democracy?
First, democracy must begin with ordinary people.
Viewing democracy as only elections has led to widespread disillusionment.
We must instead work to center ordinary people in democratic life.
Protest provides us one way to do that.
Regardless of your age, sexuality, your gender, whether you're a citizen or a non-citizen, able-bodied or disabled, anyone can participate.
In contrast to elections, protests are not confined by rigid electoral cycles.
They offer a much more immediate form of action in our era of instant feedback.
Second, while protests may be messy, this is what makes them powerful.
Protests are contentious and contested processes, defined by contingent actions, often devoid of clear messaging, characterized by incomplete organization.
These dynamics are what makes it easy to dismiss protests as riots or to assume they are of limited political utility.
But it also makes them easier to suppress.
Too often, governments do not view protests as elementary to democracy.
Instead, they violently crush social movements or work to discredit their message.
Third, as I already hinted, protest is the space from which new political imaginations may emerge.
Protests are about coloring outside the lines, a way for ordinary people to rewrite the rules of the game that too many feel are stacked against them.
Many young people in Africa have grown up in societies where a single ruler has ruled their entire lives.
Protest is the space for new possibilities to emerge, as young people begin to discover their own power.
Consider the situation of my friend Linda Masarira, a single mother of five, who is leading protests against the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe.
She has been beaten, arrested, harassed.
But Linda perseveres, because as she told me a few months ago, protest has given her a sense of meaning and direction.
And though she knows the odds against her, Linda perseveres.
Like Linda and other young African activists, we all must work to redefine democracy as something more than just elections and political parties.
Democracy is a creative process, and protest has always been the vehicle for expanding our political imaginations beyond what we are told is possible.
(In Swahili) Thank you very much.
(Sikh Prayer) Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.
There is a moment on the birthing table that feels like dying.
The body in labor stretches to form an impossible circle.
The contractions are less than a minute apart.
Wave after wave, there is barely time to breathe.
The medical term: "transition," because "feels like dying" is not scientific enough.
(Laughter)
I checked.
During my transition, my husband was pressing down on my sacrum to keep my body from breaking.
My father was waiting behind the hospital curtain ... more like hiding.
But my mother was at my side.
The midwife said she could see the baby's head, but all I could feel was a ring of fire.
I turned to my mother and said, "I can't," but she was already pouring my grandfather's prayer in my ear.
(Sikh Prayer) "Tati Vao Na Lagi, Par Brahm Sarnai." "The hot winds cannot touch you."
"You are brave," she said. "You are brave." And suddenly I saw my grandmother standing behind my mother.
And her mother behind her.
And her mother behind her.
A long line of women who had pushed through the fire before me.
I took a breath; I pushed; my son was born.
As I held him in my arms, shaking and sobbing from the rush of oxytocin that flooded my body, my mother was already preparing to feed me.
Nursing her baby as I nursed mine.
My mother had never stopped laboring for me, from my birth to my son's birth.
She already knew what I was just beginning to name.
That love is more than a rush of feeling that happens to us if we're lucky.
Love is sweet labor. Fierce. Bloody. Imperfect. Life-giving. A choice we make over and over again.
I am an American civil rights activist who has labored with communities of color since September 11, fighting unjust policies by the state and acts of hate in the street.
And in our most painful moments, in the face of the fires of injustice, I have seen labors of love deliver us.
My life on the frontlines of fighting hate in America has been a study in what I've come to call revolutionary love.
Revolutionary love is the choice to enter into labor for others who do not look like us, for our opponents who hurt us and for ourselves.
In this era of enormous rage, when the fires are burning all around us, I believe that revolutionary love is the call of our times.
Now, if you cringe when people say, "Love is the answer ..." I do, too.
(Laughter)
I am a lawyer.
(Laughter) So let me show you how I came to see love as a force for social justice through three lessons.
My first encounter with hate was in the schoolyard.
I was a little girl growing up in California, where my family has lived and farmed for a century.
When I was told that I would go to hell because I was not Christian, called a "black dog" because I was not white, I ran to my grandfather's arms.
Papa Ji dried my tears — gave me the words of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh faith. "I see no stranger," said Nanak. "I see no enemy." My grandfather taught me that I could choose to see all the faces I meet and wonder about them.
And if I wonder about them, then I will listen to their stories even when it's hard.
I will refuse to hate them even when they hate me.
I will even vow to protect them when they are in harm's way.
That's what it means to be a Sikh: S-i-k-h.
To walk the path of a warrior saint.
He told me the story of the first Sikh woman warrior, Mai Bhago.
The story goes there were 40 soldiers who abandoned their post during a great battle against an empire.
They returned to a village, and this village woman turned to them and said, "You will not abandon the fight.
You will return to the fire, and I will lead you." She mounted a horse.
She donned a turban.
And with sword in her hand and fire in her eyes, she led them where no one else would.
She became the one she was waiting for. "Don't abandon your posts, my dear." My grandfather saw me as a warrior.
I was a little girl in two long braids, but I promised.
Fast-forward, I'm 20 years old, watching the Twin Towers fall, the horror stuck in my throat, and then a face flashes on the screen: a brown man with a turban and beard, and I realize that our nation's new enemy looks like my grandfather.
And these turbans meant to represent our commitment to serve cast us as terrorists.
And Sikhs became targets of hate, alongside our Muslim brothers and sisters.
The first person killed in a hate crime after September 11 was a Sikh man, standing in front of his gas station in Arizona.
Balbir Singh Sodhi was a family friend I called "uncle," murdered by a man who called himself "patriot." He is the first of many to have been killed, but his story -- our stories barely made the evening news.
I didn't know what to do, but I had a camera, I faced the fire.
I went to his widow, Joginder Kaur.
I wept with her, and I asked her, "What would you like to tell the people of America?" I was expecting blame.
But she looked at me and said, "Tell them, 'Thank you.' 3,000 Americans came to my husband's memorial.
They did not know me, but they wept with me.
"Tell them, 'Thank you.' Thousands of people showed up, because unlike national news, the local media told Balbir Uncle's story.
Stories can create the wonder that turns strangers into sisters and brothers.
This was my first lesson in revolutionary love — that stories can help us see no stranger.
And so ... my camera became my sword.
My law degree became my shield.
My film partner became my husband.
(Laughter)
I didn't expect that.
And we became part of a generation of advocates working with communities facing their own fires.
I worked inside of supermax prisons, on the shores of Guantanamo, at the sites of mass shootings when the blood was still fresh on the ground.
And every time, for 15 years, with every film, with every lawsuit, with every campaign, I thought we were making the nation safer for the next generation.
And then my son was born.
In a time... when hate crimes against our communities are at the highest they have been since 9 / 11. When right-wing nationalist movements are on the rise around the globe and have captured the presidency of the United States. When white supremacists march in our streets, torches high, hoods off. And I have to reckon with the fact that my son is growing up in a country more dangerous for him than the one I was given.
And there will be moments when I cannot protect him when he is seen as a terrorist ... just as black people in America are still seen as criminal. Brown people, illegal.
Women and girls as property. And when they fail to see our bodies as some mother's child, it becomes easier to ban us, detain us, deport us, imprison us, sacrifice us for the illusion of security.
(Applause)
I wanted to abandon my post.
But I made a promise, so I returned to the gas station where Balbir Singh Sodhi was killed 15 years to the day.
I set down a candle in the spot where he bled to death.
His brother, Rana, turned to me and said, "Nothing has changed."
And I asked, "Who have we not yet tried to love?"
We decided to call the murderer in prison. The phone rings. My heart is beating in my ears.
I hear the voice of Frank Roque, a man who once said ... "I'm going to go out and shoot some towel heads.
We should kill their children, too. "And every emotional impulse in me says," I can't. "It becomes an act of will to wonder." Why? "I ask." Why did you agree to speak with us? "
Frank says, "I'm sorry for what happened, but I'm also sorry for all the people killed on 9 / 11." He fails to take responsibility.
I become angry to protect Rana, but Rana is still wondering about Frank -- listening -- responds.
"Frank, this is the first time I'm hearing you say that you feel sorry."
And Frank -- Frank says, "Yes.
I am sorry for what I did to your brother.
One day when I go to heaven to be judged by God, I will ask to see your brother.
And I will hug him.
And I will ask him for forgiveness."
And Rana says ... "We already forgave you."
Forgiveness is not forgetting. Forgiveness is freedom from hate.
Because when we are free from hate, we see the ones who hurt us not as monsters, but as people who themselves are wounded, who themselves feel threatened, who don't know what else to do with their insecurity but to hurt us, to pull the trigger, or cast the vote, or pass the policy aimed at us.
But if some of us begin to wonder about them, listen even to their stories, we learn that participation in oppression comes at a cost.
It cuts them off from their own capacity to love.
This was my second lesson in revolutionary love.
We love our opponents when we tend the wound in them.
Tending to the wound is not healing them -- only they can do that.
Just tending to it allows us to see our opponents: the terrorist, the fanatic, the demagogue.
They've been radicalized by cultures and policies that we together can change.
I looked back on all of our campaigns, and I realized that any time we fought bad actors, we didn't change very much.
But when we chose to wield our swords and shields to battle bad systems, that's when we saw change.
I have worked on campaigns that released hundreds of people out of solitary confinement, reformed a corrupt police department, changed federal hate crimes policy.
The choice to love our opponents is moral and pragmatic, and it opens up the previously unimaginable possibility of reconciliation.
But remember ... it took 15 years to make that phone call.
I had to tend to my own rage and grief first.
Loving our opponents requires us to love ourselves.
Gandhi, King, Mandela -- they taught a lot about how to love others and opponents.
They didn't talk a lot about loving ourselves.
This is a feminist intervention.
(Applause)
Yes. Yes.
Because for too long have women and women of color been told to suppress their rage, suppress their grief in the name of love and forgiveness.
But when we suppress our rage, that's when it hardens into hate directed outward, but usually directed inward.
But mothering has taught me that all of our emotions are necessary.
Joy is the gift of love.
Grief is the price of love.
Anger is the force that protects it.
This was my third lesson in revolutionary love.
We love ourselves when we breathe through the fire of pain and refuse to let it harden into hate.
That's why I believe that love must be practiced in all three directions to be revolutionary.
Loving just ourselves feels good, but it's narcissism.
(Laughter)
Loving only our opponents is self-loathing.
Loving only others is ineffective.
This is where a lot of our movements live right now.
We need to practice all three forms of love. And so, how do we practice it? Ready?
Number one ... in order to love others, see no stranger.
We can train our eyes to look upon strangers on the street, on the subway, on the screen, and say in our minds, "Brother, sister, aunt, uncle." And when we say this, what we are saying is, "You are a part of me I do not yet know.
I choose to wonder about you.
I will listen for your stories and pick up a sword when you are in harm's way."
And so, number two: in order to love our opponents, tend the wound.
Can you see the wound in the ones who hurt you?
Can you wonder even about them?
And if this question sends panic through your body, then your most revolutionary act is to wonder, listen and respond to your own needs.
Number three: in order to love ourselves, breathe and push.
When we are pushing into the fires in our bodies or the fires in the world, we need to be breathing together in order to be pushing together.
How are you breathing each day? Who are you breathing with? Because... when executive orders and news of violence hits our bodies hard, sometimes less than a minute apart, it feels like dying.
In those moments, my son places his hand on my cheek and says, "Dance time, mommy?" And we dance.
In the darkness, we breathe and we dance.
Our family becomes a pocket of revolutionary love.
Our joy is an act of moral resistance.
How are you protecting your joy each day?
Because in joy we see even darkness with new eyes.
And so the mother in me asks, what if this darkness is not the darkness of the tomb, but the darkness of the womb?
What if our future is not dead, but still waiting to be born?
What if this is our great transition?
Remember the wisdom of the midwife. "Breathe," she says.
And then — "push." Because if we don't push, we will die.
If we don't breathe, we will die.
Revolutionary love requires us to breathe and push through the fire with a warrior's heart and a saint's eyes so that one day... one day you will see my son as your own and protect him when I am not there.
You will tend to the wound in the ones who want to hurt him.
You will teach him how to love himself because you love yourself.
You will whisper in his ear, as I whisper in yours, "You are brave." You are brave.
Thank you.

I'm a scientist, and I'm a big fan of Star Trek, especially of Mr. Spock.
Mr. Spock is a scientist as well, and at the same time, he's the first [officer] of the starship Enterprise, and during the adventures of the Enterprise crew, he and his colleagues are dealing a lot with the presence or absence of Mr. Spock's emotions.
Mr. Spock is half-human and half-Vulcan, and Vulcans are an alien race who learn to control and suppress their feelings and to act purely out of logic.
As Mr. Spock is only half-Vulcan, he sees himself constantly in conflict in between logic and emotions, and as he's part of a team, the whole crew is struggling with, is analyzing, and is making fun of this conflict.
And also the fans of Star Trek watch with amusement this seemingly contradictory behavior.
They find it quite fascinating.
And the matter is a golden thread through the whole Star Trek series and movies from the '60s until today.
And that's actually what I want to talk about today: the role of emotions in science.
We tend to think that science is all about facts and logic and human feelings are often neglected or considered an obstacle to get rid of.
I would like to suggest that emotions are as important in science as they are in any other part of our lives.
Science is made by humans, and as human beings, even if we try hard, we cannot get rid of our emotions.
So instead of fighting them, I believe that even in science, we should make use of our feelings, because for breakthroughs and innovation, they are equally important as facts and logic.
I will come back to Mr. Spock, but first let me share my experience on the role of emotions in science, and one story in particular kept me thinking about it for the last couple of years.
I'm working in research on organic light-emitting diodes, so-called OLEDs.
This is how you might know them, as new generation of displays.
OLEDs are more and more used in smartphone displays and TV screens.
They make them appear bright, truly colorful and bendable.
This is how they look like in the research lab of my physicist colleagues.
And this is what I, as a chemist, have in mind when I think about them.
I've loved it ever since I started to work on it.
So I didn't really like the news when the company I had been working for -- that was my previous employer -- announced that they wanted to stop OLED research.
At the time, the management had reasons for this decision, and the company handled it very well, actually.
Nobody lost their jobs, and everybody was rewarded for their performed work.
What I want to show you today is what happened with my scientist colleagues and me during the time in between the announcement and the last working day on our project.
Consider it a small case study on emotions in science.
In 2015, our research team had grown to more than 80 people, and even after the announcement that our project was discontinued, we could not stop working from one day to another.
It took several months to bring all activities to a sound end and to find new jobs within the company for everyone.
Here's what happened. Even though we knew that we were working on a project that was to be stopped, during those months our output hit the roof.
We were actually working on two different OLED projects: first, the development of materials for blue-shining OLEDs, which had started in 2001; and second, materials for green OLEDs, which had started in 2014.
And the results I show you here concern the green OLED project.
In the graph, you can see how the lifetime, which is a crucial measure for the durability of our devices, developed over time.
In 2015, just half a year into the project, we were told to scale down, to stop working on the project as soon as possible and to start over in other jobs.
Nevertheless, from this time on, our results continued to improve rapidly.
How did that happen? After the announcement, pretty quickly, colleagues started leaving the team, and soon, we were left in a small group, all pretty much sharing the same attitude of, "I'm going to be the last person leaving the ship." What I mean is, while the number of scientists working on the project was decreasing, the dedication of people remaining grew dramatically.
And also, a new and more intense team spirit formed.
We all shared the same passion for our work, we all were sad that it was about to end, and we all wanted to show that we could turn our ideas into reality.
We felt that we belonged to something bigger.
And furthermore, our project was less and less in the focus of the management, because they started to think about new projects, restructuring and so on.
This resulted in additional freedom and the possibility to take a few things into our own hands.
Of course, more freedom also means more responsibility, which we were happy to take, because we believed in our work. We felt empowered. And these three pillars -- dedication, belonging and empowerment -- worked together in a kind of self-reinforcing cycle, and the closer we got to shutdown, the better our output became.
So we were working with such personal engagement on a project already sentenced to death because we felt connected to something meaningful.
Of course, it was also a hard and sometimes frustrating time, but we were sitting together in the lab, or occasionally in the café, sharing our sadness about the end of our project as well as the joy in our work.
So overall, we had a very intense and mesmerizingly exciting time.
And the lifetime we finally obtained for our materials was on one level with already commercialized materials for green OLEDs at the time, and we achieved this within just one year.
And those results helped our employer to sell the patents for real value.
Now, let me tell you the same story with different characters and a slightly different operation.
The story is part of Star Trek.
And sorry for those of you who haven't seen the movies, but I need to introduce a spoiler here.
After Mr. Spock sacrificed himself to save the starship Enterprise at the end of Star Trek II, Captain Kirk and his core team were determined to hunt through the universe to search for Spock, even though they could see only very little chance in finding him alive.
And Starfleet Command did not give them permission nor a starship to do so, so they took it very passionately into their own hands to travel out to find Spock.
And after dealing with great challenges, they eventually found Spock, and he happily and gratefully joined the team again.
He could feel the dedication and the connection of his team towards their project, which was to save him and to hold the crew together.
And over the years, over the episodes of the saga, Mr. Spock came to realize that the combination of both logic and emotions is crucial for facing challenges and exploring new worlds, and there was no contradiction anymore.
So the storyline here for both our OLED story and Star Trek is actually the basic setting for a lot of breakthrough stories, in and out of science.
The main characters are all part of a great team.
All team members show a huge dedication towards reaching their goal.
They strive to seize all the freedom they can get, and they take the responsibility they need to take.
During the time our OLED project was nearing the end, I received one piece of advice several times. "Don't take it to your heart.
You can work on something else." If I had followed it, it would have saved me several depressed evenings and many tears, but at the same time, I would have failed to gain a great deal in personal development and happiness.
And as the same is true for my colleagues and our whole project, we would have achieved far less.
So of course, science should be based on facts and logic.
When I say we should use our emotions in science, I do not suggest we should use feelings instead of facts.
But I say we should not be afraid of using our feelings to implement and to catalyze fact-based science and innovation.
Emotions and logic do not oppose each other.
They complement each other, and they reinforce each other.
The feeling of being dedicated to something meaningful, of belonging to something bigger and of being empowered is crucial for creativity and innovation.
Whatever you are working on, make sure that it matters, and take it to your heart as much as you like.
Thank you.

Automation anxiety has been spreading lately, a fear that in the future, many jobs will be performed by machines rather than human beings, given the remarkable advances that are unfolding in artificial intelligence and robotics.
What's clear is that there will be significant change.
What's less clear is what that change will look like.
My research suggests that the future is both troubling and exciting.
The threat of technological unemployment is real, and yet it's a good problem to have.
And to explain how I came to that conclusion, I want to confront three myths that I think are currently obscuring our vision of this automated future.
A picture that we see on our television screens, in books, in films, in everyday commentary is one where an army of robots descends on the workplace with one goal in mind: to displace human beings from their work.
And I call this the Terminator myth.
Yes, machines displace human beings from particular tasks, but they don't just substitute for human beings.
They also complement them in other tasks, making that work more valuable and more important.
Sometimes they complement human beings directly, making them more productive or more efficient at a particular task.
So a taxi driver can use a satnav system to navigate on unfamiliar roads.
An architect can use computer-assisted design software to design bigger, more complicated buildings.
But technological progress doesn't just complement human beings directly.
It also complements them indirectly, and it does this in two ways.
The first is if we think of the economy as a pie, technological progress makes the pie bigger.
As productivity increases, incomes rise and demand grows.
The British pie, for instance, is more than a hundred times the size it was 300 years ago.
And so people displaced from tasks in the old pie could find tasks to do in the new pie instead.
But technological progress doesn't just make the pie bigger.
It also changes the ingredients in the pie.
As time passes, people spend their income in different ways, changing how they spread it across existing goods, and developing tastes for entirely new goods, too.
New industries are created, new tasks have to be done and that means often new roles have to be filled.
So again, the British pie: 300 years ago, most people worked on farms, 150 years ago, in factories, and today, most people work in offices.
And once again, people displaced from tasks in the old bit of pie could tumble into tasks in the new bit of pie instead.
Economists call these effects complementarities, but really that's just a fancy word to capture the different way that technological progress helps human beings.
Resolving this Terminator myth shows us that there are two forces at play: one, machine substitution that harms workers, but also these complementarities that do the opposite.
Now the second myth, what I call the intelligence myth.
What do the tasks of driving a car, making a medical diagnosis and identifying a bird at a fleeting glimpse have in common?
Well, these are all tasks that until very recently, leading economists thought couldn't readily be automated.
And yet today, all of these tasks can be automated.
You know, all major car manufacturers have driverless car programs.
There's countless systems out there that can diagnose medical problems.
And there's even an app that can identify a bird at a fleeting glimpse.
Now, this wasn't simply a case of bad luck on the part of economists.
They were wrong, and the reason why they were wrong is very important.
They've fallen for the intelligence myth, the belief that machines have to copy the way that human beings think and reason in order to outperform them.
When these economists were trying to figure out what tasks machines could not do, they imagined the only way to automate a task was to sit down with a human being, get them to explain to you how it was they performed a task, and then try and capture that explanation in a set of instructions for a machine to follow.
This view was popular in artificial intelligence at one point, too.
I know this because Richard Susskind, who is my dad and my coauthor, wrote his doctorate in the 1980s on artificial intelligence and the law at Oxford University, and he was part of the vanguard.
And with a professor called Phillip Capper and a legal publisher called Butterworths, they produced the world's first commercially available artificial intelligence system in the law.
This was the home screen design.
He assures me this was a cool screen design at the time. (Laughter) I've never been entirely convinced.
He published it in the form of two floppy disks, at a time where floppy disks genuinely were floppy, and his approach was the same as the economists': sit down with a lawyer, get her to explain to you how it was she solved a legal problem, and then try and capture that explanation in a set of rules for a machine to follow.
In economics, if human beings could explain themselves in this way, the tasks are called routine, and they could be automated.
But if human beings can't explain themselves, the tasks are called non-routine, and they're thought to be out reach.
Today, that routine-nonroutine distinction is widespread.
Think how often you hear people say to you machines can only perform tasks that are predictable or repetitive, rules-based or well-defined.
Those are all just different words for routine.
And go back to those three cases that I mentioned at the start.
Those are all classic cases of nonroutine tasks.
Ask a doctor, for instance, how she makes a medical diagnosis, and she might be able to give you a few rules of thumb, but ultimately she'd struggle.
She'd say it requires things like creativity and judgment and intuition.
And these things are very difficult to articulate, and so it was thought these tasks would be very hard to automate.
If a human being can't explain themselves, where on earth do we begin in writing a set of instructions for a machine to follow?
Thirty years ago, this view was right, but today it's looking shaky, and in the future it's simply going to be wrong.
Advances in processing power, in data storage capability and in algorithm design mean that this routine-nonroutine distinction is diminishingly useful.
To see this, go back to the case of making a medical diagnosis.
Earlier in the year, a team of researchers at Stanford announced they'd developed a system which can tell you whether or not a freckle is cancerous as accurately as leading dermatologists. How does it work? It's not trying to copy the judgment or the intuition of a doctor.
It knows or understands nothing about medicine at all.
Instead, it's running a pattern recognition algorithm through 129,450 past cases, hunting for similarities between those cases and the particular lesion in question.
It's performing these tasks in an unhuman way, based on the analysis of more possible cases than any doctor could hope to review in their lifetime.
It didn't matter that that human being, that doctor, couldn't explain how she'd performed the task.
Now, there are those who dwell upon that the fact that these machines aren't built in our image.
As an example, take IBM's Watson, the supercomputer that went on the US quiz show "Jeopardy!" in 2011, and it beat the two human champions at "Jeopardy!" The day after it won, The Wall Street Journal ran a piece by the philosopher John Searle with the title "Watson Doesn't Know It Won on 'Jeopardy!'" Right, and it's brilliant, and it's true.
You know, Watson didn't let out a cry of excitement.
It didn't call up its parents to say what a good job it had done.
It didn't go down to the pub for a drink.
This system wasn't trying to copy the way that those human contestants played, but it didn't matter.
It still outperformed them.
Resolving the intelligence myth shows us that our limited understanding about human intelligence, about how we think and reason, is far less of a constraint on automation than it was in the past.
What's more, as we've seen, when these machines perform tasks differently to human beings, there's no reason to think that what human beings are currently capable of doing represents any sort of summit in what these machines might be capable of doing in the future.
Now the third myth, what I call the superiority myth.
It's often said that those who forget about the helpful side of technological progress, those complementarities from before, are committing something known as the lump of labor fallacy.
Now, the problem is the lump of labor fallacy is itself a fallacy, and I call this the lump of labor fallacy fallacy, or LOLFF, for short. Let me explain. The lump of labor fallacy is a very old idea.
It was a British economist, David Schloss, who gave it this name in 1892.
He was puzzled to come across a dock worker who had begun to use a machine to make washers, the small metal discs that fasten on the end of screws.
And this dock worker felt guilty for being more productive.
Now, most of the time, we expect the opposite, that people feel guilty for being unproductive, you know, a little too much time on Facebook or Twitter at work.
But this worker felt guilty for being more productive, and asked why, he said, "I know I'm doing wrong.
I'm taking away the work of another man." In his mind, there was some fixed lump of work to be divided up between him and his pals, so that if he used this machine to do more, there'd be less left for his pals to do.
Schloss saw the mistake.
The lump of work wasn't fixed.
As this worker used the machine and became more productive, the price of washers would fall, demand for washers would rise, more washers would have to be made, and there'd be more work for his pals to do.
The lump of work would get bigger.
Schloss called this "the lump of labor fallacy."
And today you hear people talk about the lump of labor fallacy to think about the future of all types of work.
There's no fixed lump of work out there to be divided up between people and machines.
Yes, machines substitute for human beings, making the original lump of work smaller, but they also complement human beings, and the lump of work gets bigger and changes. But LOLFF. Here's the mistake: it's right to think that technological progress makes the lump of work to be done bigger.
Some tasks become more valuable. New tasks have to be done.
But it's wrong to think that necessarily, human beings will be best placed to perform those tasks.
And this is the superiority myth.
Yes, the lump of work might get bigger and change, but as machines become more capable, it's likely that they'll take on the extra lump of work themselves.
Technological progress, rather than complement human beings, complements machines instead.
To see this, go back to the task of driving a car.
Today, satnav systems directly complement human beings.
They make some human beings better drivers.
But in the future, software is going to displace human beings from the driving seat, and these satnav systems, rather than complement human beings, will simply make these driverless cars more efficient, helping the machines instead.
Or go to those indirect complementarities that I mentioned as well.
The economic pie may get larger, but as machines become more capable, it's possible that any new demand will fall on goods that machines, rather than human beings, are best placed to produce.
but as machines become more capable, The economic pie may change, it's possible that they'll be best placed to do the new tasks that have to be done.
In short, demand for tasks isn't demand for human labor.
Human beings only stand to benefit if they retain the upper hand in all these complemented tasks, but as machines become more capable, that becomes less likely.
So what do these three myths tell us then?
one, machine substitution that harms workers, Well, resolving the Terminator myth shows us that the future of work depends upon this balance between two forces: but also those complementarities that do the opposite.
And until now, this balance has fallen in favor of human beings.
But resolving the intelligence myth shows us that that first force, machine substitution, is gathering strength.
Machines, of course, can't do everything, but they can do far more, encroaching ever deeper into the realm of tasks performed by human beings.
What's more, there's no reason to think that what human beings are currently capable of represents any sort of finishing line, that machines are going to draw to a polite stop once they're as capable as us.
Now, none of this matters so long as those helpful winds of complementarity blow firmly enough, but resolving the superiority myth shows us that that process of task encroachment not only strengthens the force of machine substitution, but it wears down those helpful complementarities too.
Bring these three myths together and I think we can capture a glimpse of that troubling future.
Machines continue to become more capable, encroaching ever deeper on tasks performed by human beings, strengthening the force of machine substitution, weakening the force of machine complementarity.
rather than human beings, And at some point, that balance falls in favor of machines
This is the path we're currently on.
I say "path" deliberately, because I don't think we're there yet, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this is our direction of travel.
That's the troubling part.
Let me say now why I think actually this is a good problem to have.
For most of human history, one economic problem has dominated: how to make the economic pie large enough for everyone to live on.
Go back to the turn of the first century AD, and if you took the global economic pie and divided it up into equal slices for everyone in the world, everyone would get a few hundred dollars.
Almost everyone lived on or around the poverty line.
And if you roll forward a thousand years, roughly the same is true.
But in the last few hundred years, economic growth has taken off.
Those economic pies have exploded in size.
Global GDP per head, the value of those individual slices of the pie today, they're about 10,150 dollars.
If economic growth continues at two percent, our children will be twice as rich as us.
If it continues at a more measly one percent, our grandchildren will be twice as rich as us.
By and large, we've solved that traditional economic problem.
Now, technological unemployment, if it does happen, in a strange way will be a symptom of that success, will have solved one problem -- how to make the pie bigger -- but replaced it with another -- how to make sure that everyone gets a slice.
As other economists have noted, solving this problem won't be easy.
Today, for most people, their job is their seat at the economic dinner table, and in a world with less work or even without work, it won't be clear how they get their slice.
There's a great deal of discussion, for instance, about various forms of universal basic income as one possible approach, and there's trials underway in the United States and in Finland and in Kenya.
And this is the collective challenge that's right in front of us, to figure out how this material prosperity generated by our economic system can be enjoyed by everyone in a world in which our traditional mechanism for slicing up the pie, the work that people do, withers away and perhaps disappears.
Solving this problem is going to require us to think in very different ways.
There's going to be a lot of disagreement about what ought to be done, but it's important to remember that this is a far better problem to have than the one that haunted our ancestors for centuries: how to make that pie big enough in the first place.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
It's 4am in the morning.
I'm waking up in a Boston hotel room and can only think of one thing: tooth pain.
One of my ceramic inlays fell off the evening before.
Five hours later, I'm sitting in a dentist's chair.
But instead of having a repair of my inlay so that I can get rid of my pain, the dentist pitches me on the advantages of a titanium implant surgery.
Ever heard of that?
(Laughter)
It essentially means to replace a damaged tooth by an artificial one, that is screwed into your jaw.
Estimated costs for the implant surgery may add up to 10,000 US dollars.
Replacing the ceramic inlay I had before would come in at 100 US dollars.
Was it my health or the money that could be earned with me that was the biggest concern for my dentist?
As it turned out, my experience wasn't an isolated case.
A study by a US national newspaper estimated that in the United States, up to 30 percent of all surgical procedures -- including stent and pacemaker implantations, hip replacements and uterus removals -- were conducted although other nonsurgical treatment options had not been fully exploited by the physician in charge.
Isn't that figure shocking?
Numbers may be slightly different in other countries, but what it means is that if you go to a doctor in the US, you have a not-insignificant chance to be subjected to a surgical intervention without there being an immediate need for it. Why is this? Why are some practitioners incentivized to run such unnecessary procedures?
Well, perhaps it is because health care systems themselves incentivize in a nonideal way towards applying or not applying certain procedures or treatments.
As most health care systems reimburse practitioners in a fee-for-service-based fashion on the number and kind of treatments performed, it may be this economic incentive that tempts some practitioners to rather perform high-profit surgical treatments instead of exploring other treatment options.
Although certain countries started to implement performance-based reimbursement, anchored on a quality and efficacy matrix, overall, there's very little in today's health care systems' architecture to incentivize practitioners broadly to actively prevent the appearance of a disease in the first place and to limit the procedures applied to a patient to the most effective options.
So how do we fix this? What it may take is a fundamental redesign of our health care system's architecture -- a complete rethinking of the incentive structure.
What we may need is a health care system that reimburses practitioners for keeping their customers healthy instead of almost only paying for services once people are already sick.
What we may need is a transformation from today's system that largely cares for the sick, to a system that cares for the healthy.
To change our current "sick care" approach into a true "health care" approach.
It is a paradigm shift from treating people once they have become sick to preserving the health of the healthy before they get sick.
This shift may move the focus of all those involved — from doctors, to hospitals, to pharmaceutical and medical companies — on the product that this industry ultimately sells: health.
Imagine the following. What if we redesign our health care system into one that does not reimburse practitioners for the actual procedures performed on a patient but rather reimburses doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical companies for every day a single individual is kept healthy and doesn't develop a disease?
for every day a single individual is kept healthy and doesn't develop a disease? In practical terms, we could, for example, use public money to pay a health fee to an insurance company or doesn't require any other form of acute medical intervention.
If the individual becomes sick, the insurance company will not receive any further monetary compensation for the medical interventions required to treat the disease of that individual, but they would be obliged to pay for every evidence-based treatment option to return the customer back to health.
Once the customer's healthy again, the health fee for that individual will be paid again.
In effect, all players in the system are now responsible for keeping their customers healthy, and they're incentivized to avoid any unnecessary medical interventions by simply reducing the number of people that eventually become sick.
The more healthy people there are, the less the cost to treat the sick will be, and the higher the economic benefit for all parties being involved in keeping these individuals healthy is.
This change of the incentive structure shifts, now, the attention of the complete health care system away from providing isolated and singular treatment options, towards a holistic view of what is useful for an individual to stay healthy and live long.
Now, to effectively preserve health, people will need to be willing to share their health data on a constant basis, so that the health care system understands early enough if any assistance with regard to their health is needed.
Physical examination, monitoring of lifetime health data as well as genetic sequencing, cardiometabolic profiling and imaging-based technologies will allow customers to make, together with health coaches and general practitioners, optimal and science-guided decisions -- for their diet, their medication and their physical activity -- to diminish their unique probability to fall sick of an identified, individual high-risk disease.
Artificial intelligence-based data analysis and the miniaturization of sensor technologies are already starting to make monitoring of the individual health status possible.
Measuring cardiometabolic parameters by devices like this or the detection of circulating tumor DNA in your bloodstream early on after cancer disease onset are only two examples for such monitoring technologies.
Take cancer. One of the biggest problems in certain oncological diseases is that a large number of patients is diagnosed too late to allow them to be cured, although the drugs and treatments that could potentially have cured them are already existing today, if the disease had only been detected earlier.
New technologies allow now, based on a few milliliters of blood, to detect the presence of circulating tumor DNA and thus, the presence of cancer, early on in a really convenient manner.
The impact that this early-stage detection can have may be dramatic.
The five-year survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer when diagnosed at stage one, which is early, is 49 percent.
The same, when diagnosed at stage four, which is late, is below one percent.
Being potentially able to prevent a large number of deaths by something as simple as a blood test for circulating tumor DNA could make certain cancer types a manageable disease, as disease onset can be detected earlier and positive treatment outcomes can likely be increased.
In 2012, 50 percent of all Americans had a single chronic disease, resulting in 86 percent of the $3 trillion US health care budget being spent for treating such chronic diseases. Eighty-six percent. If new technologies allow now to reduce this 86 percent, why have health care systems not reacted and changed already?
Well, a redesign of what today is a sick care system into a true health care system that focuses on prevention and behavioral changes requires every actor in the system to change.
It requires the political willingness to shift budgets and policies towards prevention and health education to design a new set of financial and non-financial incentives.
It requires creating a regulatory framework for the gathering, using and sharing of personal health data that's at the same time stringent and sensible.
It needs doctors, hospitals, insurers, pharmaceutical and medical companies to reframe their approach and, most important, it can't happen without the willingness and motivation of individuals to change their lifestyle in a sustained way, to prioritize staying healthy, in addition to opening up for sharing the health data on a constant basis.
This change may not come overnight.
But by refocusing the incentives within the health care industry today to actively keep people healthy, we may not only be able to prevent more diseases in the first place but we may also be able to detect the onset of certain preventable diseases earlier than we do today, which will lead to longer and healthier lives for more people.
are already existing today, Most of the technologies that we need to initiate that change
But this is not a technology question.
It is primarily a question of vision and will.
Thanks a lot.
(Applause)
For as long as I remember, I've loved mathematics.
Actually, it's not 100 percent true.
I've loved mathematics for all but a two-week period in senior high school.
(Laughter)
I was top of my class, and we were about to start the Extension Maths course.
I was really excited about this brand new topic coming up, complex numbers. I like complex. My teacher was priming us for the concepts with some questions about square roots.
Square of nine -- three; square of 256 -- sixteen. Too easy. Then she asked the trick question: What about the square root of negative one?
Of course, we were all over it -- "Come on, Miss!
We all know you can't take the square root of a negative." "That's true in the real world," she said. "But in the complex world, the square root of negative one is the imaginary number i."
That day, my entire mathematical world came crashing down on me.
(Laughter)
"Imaginary numbers? Seriously? But mathematics is a source of truth, please don't go abstract on me.
I would have studied art if I wanted to play with imaginary numbers."
(Laughter)
"This is Extension Maths, let's get back with our program!" She didn't, and over the next couple of weeks, I reluctantly performed meaningless calculations,
(Laughter)
finding imaginary solutions to quadratic equations.
(Laughter)
But then something amazing happened.
We began finding elegant solutions to real-world problems we previously had no answers to, starting with the complex world of imaginary numbers.
So some mathematician 500 years ago decides to have some fun and make up these imaginary numbers, and because of that we can now derive these amazing identities with applications in the real world, in fields like electrical engineering. Wow! I gained a whole new level of appreciation for mathematics.
And after my brief mistrust, I was now in love with the subject more than ever.
Francis Su, the mathematician, sums it up beautifully when he says, "We study mathematics for play, for beauty, for truth, for justice and for love." But if you ask a student today, you'll probably hear a different story.
You might hear "difficult" and "boring." And they might be right about difficult.
But it's certainly not boring.
In fact, I'd say being difficult to master is part of what makes it beautiful.
Because nothing worth doing is easy.
So we need students to stick around long enough through the difficult parts to appreciate the beauty when it all ties together.
Much like I did for that brief couple of weeks in high school.
Unfortunately, our school systems -- we move students through mathematics in a lockstep process.
So those who fall a little behind find it near impossible to ever catch up and appreciate that beauty.
But why is this a problem? Why should we care?
Well today, more than ever, our world needs every citizen to be skilled in mathematics.
With the advent of artificial intelligence and automation, many of the jobs we see today will either not exist or be transformed to require less routine work and more analysis and application of expertise.
But we're not producing the extra mathematics students to fill these new roles.
This graph shows the number of students taking Standard Mathematics and Advanced Mathematics over a period of 20 years in Australia.
It's clear that while we have demand for mathematics skills rapidly increasing, supply is in steady decline.
To put things in perspective, half of the students completing high school today in Australia are not prepared to understand any argument about rates of change in data.
In this digital age where fake news can influence election results, this is very concerning.
Let me give you a concrete example. Let's take a closer look at that graph.
Can everyone see what I've done there to stress my point?
If you can't, let me show you now, with the vertical axis starting at zero, where it should be.
There, you see it now, right?
It's the exact same data but I've manipulated the representation to influence you.
And that's cool, that's my job up here.
(Laughter)
But in all seriousness, unless we do something to drastically improve student engagement with mathematics, we'll not only have a huge skills shortage crisis but a fickle population, easily manipulated by whoever can get the most air time.
So what's the solution?
There are a lot of things we have to do.
We need curriculum reform.
We need our best and brightest encouraged to become teachers.
We need to put an end to high-stakes tests and instead follow a mastery-based learning approach.
But all these things take time.
And I'm impatient.
See, I've been thinking about this for eight years now.
Ever since I left my job as a derivative trader to build a web application to help students learn mathematics.
Today, our app is used by schools across the globe.
And we're seeing big improvements for students who use the program regularly.
But here's the thing — we're only seeing it for students who use the program regularly.
And most of them don't.
So after years of developing and refining the application, our biggest challenge was not so much product related, our biggest challenge was motivating students to want to work on their gaps in understanding.
You can imagine in today's attention economy, we're competing against Facebook, Snapchat and PlayStation to try and get these students' time.
So we went back to the drawing board and started to think about how we could make it worthwhile for students to spend some of their "attention budget" on their education.
We tinkered with gamification elements like points, badges and avatars, and we'd see a temporary spike in engagement but things would go back to normal as soon as the novelty wore off.
Then one day, my cofounder, Alvin, came across a study of students in Chicago led by the behavioral economist, Steven Levitt, where they paid students who improved on their test scores.
He started telling me about some of the things they tested for and the interesting findings they had.
For instance, they found that incentivizing students for inputs, like effort, worked a lot better than incentivizing for outputs, like test scores.
They found that for younger students, you could win them over with a trophy but for older students, you really needed cash.
(Laughter)
And the amount of cash mattered -- 10 dollars was good, 20 dollars -- even better.
But perhaps most importantly, they found that the rewards had to be instant rather than promised at a later date.
They went as far as to give the students 20 dollars and say, "Touch it, feel it, smell it --"
(Sniffing)
"It's all yours. But if you fail, I'm going to take it back." And that worked really well.
I immediately got excited about the possibilities of implementing this in our program.
But once the excitement settled down, there were a few concerns that crept in our minds.
Firstly, was this ethical?
(Laughter)
Secondly, how would we fund this thing?
(Laughter)
And finally, would the results be sustained if the students were no longer paid?
Now, let's look at the ethical part first.
I'm a bit of a mathematical purist.
So I'd be one of the first people to say that we should study mathematics for the sake of mathematics.
Remember — for play, for beauty, for truth, for justice and for love! Not for money!
(Laughter)
As I struggled with this, I came to see that, while it's a way I look at mathematics now, it's only because I studied it long enough to appreciate it.
It's very difficult to tell a student struggling with mathematics today to work hard for a payoff in the distant future.
And it's not so much bribery that's at work here, because I could bribe students by telling them about my big bonuses in my derivative trading days as a reward for doing well at maths.
But it doesn't pay off for a very long time.
So it's practically naught.
Behavioral economists call this hyperbolic discounting.
And Levitt goes as far as to say that all motivating power vanishes when rewards are handed out with a delay.
So, from a purely economic point of view: if we don't use immediate incentives, we are underinvesting in student outcomes.
I took heart from that, and came to see that as a society, we're actually quite used to financial incentives.
Whether it be by the government, by employers or at home.
For instance, many parents would pay their children an allowance or pocket money for doing chores in the house.
So it wasn't really all that controversial.
As I thought about that, it started to answer that second question of how we were going to fund this.
Naturally, parents are the most invested in their children's education.
So, let's charge them a weekly subscription fee to use our program, but -- if the students complete their weekly maths goal, we'll refund the subscription amount directly into the child's bank account.
We chose three exercises completed over a one week period for a 10 dollar reward.
That way we're incentivizing effort rather than performance over a short enough period and with a substantial enough payout for the students to care.
Now, I remember when I first told my wife about this new business model.
If she had any doubt left that I've gone completely mad, that pretty much confirmed it for her.
She said to me, "Mo ... you realize that if everybody does their homework, which you want, you're not going to make any revenue, which you don't want.
Great business model."
(Laughter)
I say it's more like an antibusiness model, it's free if you use it, but you pay if you don't. Now, I knew from experience that not everybody in the country was going to jump on and do their maths homework every week.
And if they did, sure we'd go bust pretty quickly, but hey, we would have solved the country's maths skills crisis.
(Laughter)
As a company, we've always run a double bottom line, looking to both make a return for investors as well as improve student outcomes.
We know that our path to long-term profitability is through improving student outcomes.
So our dual objectives should never be at odds.
So we're always looking to make our product decisions around helping students reach their weekly maths goal, effectively ensuring that they get paid and not us.
Now you must be wondering: How is this crazy business model going?
You'll be glad to know we're still in business.
We've been testing this now for the last five months on just our personal home users in Australia before we think about rolling it out to schools.
And here are the early results.
The green represents students who are completing their weekly maths goal and the red those who aren't.
You can see a lot more completing their homework than not.
In fact, as our user base has grown, we found the percentage to be pretty steady, at around 75 percent.
So on average, we receive our weekly subscription fee once every four weeks, and the other three weeks, we're rewarding the students.
Now of course we're leaving some money on the table here, but guess what?
It turns out these students are 70 percent more engaged than students not on the reward program. Check.
From a business perspective, they are less likely to churn and more likely to refer friends, so we're hoping to trade off a lower revenue per user for a bigger and more engaged user base. Check and check.
Now for that final question.
Would they keep coming back if they were no longer paid?
Mathematics is so much more than just a subject you study at school.
It's a human endeavor.
It's what helps us to understand the world around us.
And the more you know, the more you want to know.
So yes, we've triggered initial engagement with a financial reward.
But in the long run, the money won't matter anymore.
Because in the long run, the wonder of mathematics will be the incentive and understanding it will be the reward.
Thank you.
(Applause)
At some point in our lives, almost every one of us will have our heart broken.
My patient Kathy planned her wedding when she was in middle school.
She would meet her future husband by age 27, get engaged a year later and get married a year after that.
But when Kathy turned 27, she didn't find a husband.
She found a lump in her breast.
She went through many months of harsh chemotherapy and painful surgeries, and then just as she was ready to jump back into the dating world, she found a lump in her other breast and had to do it all over again.
Kathy recovered, though, and she was eager to resume her search for a husband as soon as her eyebrows grew back in.
When you're going on first dates in New York City, you need to be able to express a wide range of emotions.
(Laughter)
Soon afterwards, she met Rich and fell in love.
The relationship was everything she hoped it would be.
Six months later, after a lovely weekend in New England, Rich made reservations at their favorite romantic restaurant.
Kathy knew he was going to propose, and she could barely contain her excitement.
But Rich did not propose to Kathy that night.
He broke up with her.
As deeply as he cared for Kathy -- and he did -- he simply wasn't in love.
Kathy was shattered. Her heart was truly broken, and she now faced yet another recovery.
But five months after the breakup, Kathy still couldn't stop thinking about Rich.
Her heart was still very much broken.
The question is: Why?
Why was this incredibly strong and determined woman unable to marshal the same emotional resources that got her through four years of cancer treatments?
Why do so many of us flounder when we're trying to recover from heartbreak?
Why do the same coping mechanisms that get us through all kinds of life challenges fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken?
In over 20 years of private practice, I have seen people of every age and background face every manner of heartbreak, and what I've learned is this: when your heart is broken, the same instincts you ordinarily rely on will time and again lead you down the wrong path.
You simply cannot trust what your mind is telling you.
For example, we know from studies of heartbroken people that having a clear understanding of why the relationship ended is really important for our ability to move on.
Yet time and again, when we are offered a simple and honest explanation like the one Rich offered Kathy, we reject it.
Heartbreak creates such dramatic emotional pain, our mind tells us the cause must be equally dramatic.
And that gut instinct is so powerful, it can make even the most reasonable and measured of us come up with mysteries and conspiracy theories where none exist.
Kathy became convinced something must have happened during her romantic getaway with Rich that soured him on the relationship, and she became obsessed with figuring out what that was.
And so she spent countless hours going through every minute of that weekend in her mind, searching her memory for clues that were not there.
Kathy's mind tricked her into initiating this wild goose chase.
But what compelled her to commit to it for so many months?
Heartbreak is far more insidious than we realize.
There is a reason we keep going down one rabbit hole after another, even when we know it's going to make us feel worse.
Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids.
Kathy was going through withdrawal.
And since she could not have the heroin of actually being with Rich, her unconscious mind chose the methadone of her memories with him.
Her instincts told her she was trying to solve a mystery, but what she was actually doing was getting her fix.
This is what makes heartbreak so difficult to heal.
Addicts know they're addicted.
They know when they're shooting up.
But heartbroken people do not.
But you do now.
And if your heart is broken, you cannot ignore that.
You have to recognize that, as compelling as the urge is, with every trip down memory lane, every text you send, every second you spend stalking your ex on social media, you are just feeding your addiction, deepening your emotional pain and complicating your recovery.
Getting over heartbreak is not a journey.
It's a fight, and your reason is your strongest weapon.
There is no breakup explanation that's going to feel satisfying.
No rationale can take away the pain you feel.
So don't search for one, don't wait for one, just accept the one you were offered or make up one yourself and then put the question to rest, because you need that closure to resist the addiction.
And you need something else as well: you have to be willing to let go, to accept that it's over.
Otherwise, your mind will feed on your hope and set you back.
Hope can be incredibly destructive when your heart is broken.
Heartbreak is a master manipulator.
The ease with which it gets our mind to do the absolute opposite of what we need in order to recover is remarkable.
One of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken is to idealize the person who broke it.
We spend hours remembering their smile, how great they made us feel, that time we hiked up the mountain and made love under the stars.
All that does is make our loss feel more painful. We know that. Yet we still allow our mind to cycle through one greatest hit after another, like we were being held hostage by our own passive-aggressive Spotify playlist.
(Laughter)
Heartbreak will make those thoughts pop into your mind.
And so to avoid idealizing, you have to balance them out by remembering their frown, not just their smile, how bad they made you feel, the fact that after the lovemaking, you got lost coming down the mountain, argued like crazy and didn't speak for two days.
What I tell my patients is to compile an exhaustive list of all the ways the person was wrong for you, all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves, and then keep it on your phone.
(Laughter)
And once you have your list, you have to use it.
When I hear even a hint of idealizing or the faintest whiff of nostalgia in a session, I go, "Phone, please."
(Laughter)
Your mind will try to tell you they were perfect.
But they were not, and neither was the relationship.
And if you want to get over them, you have to remind yourself of that, frequently.
None of us is immune to heartbreak.
My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old senior executive in a software company.
Five years after his wife died, he finally felt ready to start dating again.
He soon met Sharon, and a whirlwind romance ensued.
They introduced each other to their adult children after one month, and they moved in together after two.
When middle-aged people date, they don't mess around.
It's like "Love, Actually" meets "The Fast and the Furious."
(Laughter)
Miguel was happier than he had been in years.
But the night before their first anniversary, Sharon left him.
She had decided to move to the West Coast to be closer to her children, and she didn't want a long-distance relationship.
Miguel was totally blindsided and utterly devastated.
He barely functioned at work for many, many months, and he almost lost his job as a result.
Another consequence of heartbreak is that feeling alone and in pain can significantly impair our intellectual functioning, especially when performing complex tasks involving logic and reasoning.
It temporarily lowers our IQ.
But it wasn't just the intensity of Miguel's grief that confused his employers; it was the duration.
Miguel was confused by this as well and really quite embarrassed by it. "What's wrong with me?" he asked me in our session. "What adult spends almost a year getting over a one-year relationship?" Actually, many do.
Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks of traditional loss and grief: insomnia, intrusive thoughts, immune system dysfunction.
Forty percent of people experience clinically measurable depression.
Heartbreak is a complex psychological injury.
It impacts us in a multitude of ways.
For example, Sharon was both very social and very active.
She had dinners at the house every week.
She and Miguel went on camping trips with other couples.
Although Miguel was not religious, he accompanied Sharon to church every Sunday, where he was welcomed into the congregation.
Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend; he lost his entire social life, the supportive community of Sharon's church.
He lost his identity as a couple.
Now, Miguel recognized the breakup had left this huge void in his life, but what he failed to recognize is that it left far more than just one.
And that is crucial, not just because it explains why heartbreak could be so devastating, but because it tells us how to heal.
To fix your broken heart, you have to identify these voids in your life and fill them, and I mean all of them.
The voids in your identity: you have to reestablish who you are and what your life is about.
The voids in your social life, the missing activities, even the empty spaces on the wall where pictures used to hang.
But none of that will do any good unless you prevent the mistakes that can set you back, the unnecessary searches for explanations, idealizing your ex instead of focusing on how they were wrong for you, indulging thoughts and behaviors that still give them a starring role in this next chapter of your life when they shouldn't be an extra.
Getting over heartbreak is hard, but if you refuse to be misled by your mind and you take steps to heal, you can significantly minimize your suffering.
And it won't just be you who benefit from that.
You'll be more present with your friends, more engaged with your family, not to mention the billions of dollars of compromised productivity in the workplace that could be avoided.
So if you know someone who is heartbroken, have compassion, because social support has been found to be important for their recovery.
And have patience, because it's going to take them longer to move on than you think it should.
And if you're hurting, know this: it's difficult, it is a battle within your own mind, and you have to be diligent to win.
But you do have weapons. You can fight. And you will heal.
Thank you.
(Applause)
For me, it was not being invited to a friend's wedding.
At first, I didn't really mind.
I thought he was having a small reception.
But then I kept meeting people who were going to the same wedding, and they weren't as close to the groom as I was ... and I felt left out. That really sucked. It felt really unfair.
For my daughters, Lipsi and Greta, it was last week.
They were taking turns massaging their mom's back with a toy for back rubs, and then one of the girls felt that the other girl had a longer go.
That's when I walk into the room to find Greta in a rage, shouting, "That's not fair!" and Lipsi in tears, and my wife holding a stopwatch to make sure that each girl had precisely one minute on the toy.
So if you're anything like me or my girls, the last thing that upset you probably also had to do with unfairness.
That's because unfairness triggers us so strongly that we can't think straight.
We become afraid and suspicious.
Our unfairness antennae stick up.
We feel pain, and we walk away.
Unfairness is one of the defining issues of our society, it's one of the root causes of polarization, and it's bad news for business.
At work, unfairness makes people defensive and disengaged.
A study shows that 70 percent of workers in the US are disengaged, and this is costing the companies 550 billion dollars a year every year.
This is, like, half the total spent on education in the US. This is the size of the GDP of a country like Austria.
So removing unfairness and promoting fairness should be our priority.
But what does it mean in practice?
Is it about more rules? Is it about systems? Is it about equality? Well, partly, but fairness is more interesting than rules and equality.
Fairness works in surprising ways.
15 years ago, I left a US investment bank to join a large Italian state-owned oil company.
It was a different world.
I thought the key to getting the best performance was a risk-reward system where you could give the high performers bonuses and promotions and give the underperformers something to worry about.
But in this company, we had fixed salaries and lifelong jobs.
Careers were set, so my toolkit wasn't very effective, and I was frustrated.
But then I saw that this company was producing some pockets of excellence, areas in which they beat the competition in very tough, competitive sectors.
This was true in trading, in project management -- it was very true in exploration.
Our exploration team was finding more oil and gas than any other company in the world. It was a phenomenon. Everyone was trying to figure out how this was possible.
I thought it was luck, but after each new discovery, that became less and less likely.
So did we have a special tools No. Did we have a killer application that no one else had? No. Was it one genius who was finding oil for the whole team?
No, we hadn't hired a senior guy in years.
So what was our secret sauce?
I started looking at them really carefully.
I looked at my friend, who drilled seven dry wells, writing off more than a billion dollars for the company, and found oil on the eighth.
I was nervous for him ... but he was so relaxed.
I mean, these guys knew what they were doing.
And then it hit me: it was about fairness.
These guys were working in a company where they didn't need to worry about short-term results.
They weren't going to be penalized for bad luck or for an honest mistake.
They knew they were valued for what they were trying to do, not the outcome.
They were valued as human beings. They were part of a community.
Whatever happened, the company would stand by them.
And for me, this is the definition of fairness.
It's when you can lower those unfairness antennae, put them at rest. Then great things follow.
These guys could be true to their purpose, which was finding oil and gas.
They didn't have to worry about company politics or greed or fear.
They could be good risk-takers, because they weren't too defensive and they weren't gambling to take huge rewards.
And they were excellent team workers.
They could trust their colleagues.
They didn't need to look behind their backs.
And they were basically having fun.
They were having so much fun, one guy even confessed that he was having more fun at the company Christmas dinner than at his own Christmas dinner.
(Laughter)
But these guys, essentially, were working in a fair system where they could do what they felt was right instead of what's selfish, what's quick, what's convenient, and to be able to do what we feel is right is a key ingredient for fairness, but it is also a great motivator.
And it wasn't just explorers who were doing the right thing.
There was an HR director who proposed that I hire someone internally and give him a managerial job.
This guy was very good, but he didn't finish high school, so formally, he had no qualifications.
But he was so good, it made sense, and so we gave him the job.
Or the other guy, who asked me for a budget to build a cheese factory next to our plant in Ecuador, in the village.
It didn't make any sense: no one ever built a cheese factory.
But this is what the village wanted, because the milk they had would spoil before they could sell it, so that's what they needed.
And so we built it.
So in these examples and many others, I learned that to be fair, my colleagues and I, we needed to take a risk and stick our head out, but in a fair system, you can do that.
You can dare to be fair.
So I realized that these guys and other colleagues were achieving great results, doing great things, in a way that no bonus could buy. So I was fascinated. I wanted to learn how this thing really worked, and I wanted to learn it also for myself, to become a better leader.
So I started talking to colleagues, to coaches, to headhunters and neuroscientists, and what I discovered is that what these guys were up to and the way they worked is really supported by recent brain science.
And I've also discovered that this can work at all levels in any type of company.
You don't need the fixed salaries or the stable careers.
This is because science shows that humans have an innate sense of fairness.
We know what is right and what is wrong before we can talk or think about it.
My favorite experiment has six-month old babies watching a ball trying to struggle up a hill.
And there's a helpful, friendly square that pushes the ball up the hill, and then a mean triangle pushes the ball back down.
After watching this several times, they ask the babies to pick, to choose what to play with.
They can pick a ball, a square or a triangle.
They never pick up the triangle.
All the babies want to be the square.
And science also shows that when we see or perceive fairness, our brain releases a substance that gives us pleasure, proper joy.
But when we perceive unfairness, we feel pain ... even greater pain than the same type of pain as if I really hurt myself.
That's because unfairness triggers the primitive, reptile part of our brain, the part that deals with threats and survival, and when unfairness triggers a threat, that's all we can think about.
Motivation, creativity, teamwork, they all go way back.
And it makes sense that we're wired this way, because we're social animals.
We need to be part of a community to survive.
We're born so helpless that someone needs to look after us until we're maybe 10 years old, so our brain evolves towards food.
We need to be in that community.
So whether I like it or not, not being invited to the friend's wedding, my lizard brain is generating the same response as if I'm about to be pushed out from my community.
So science explains quite nicely why fairness is good and why unfairness makes us really defensive, but science also shows that in a fair environment, not only do we all want to be the square, but we tend to be the square, and this allows other people to be fair in turn.
This creates a beautiful fairness circle.
But while we start off fair ... one drop of unfairness contaminates the whole pool, and unfortunately, there's plenty of drops in that pool.
So our effort should be to filter out as much unfairness as we can from everywhere, starting from our communities, starting from our companies.
I worry about this a lot because I lead a team of 3,000 excellent people, and the difference between 3,000 happy, motivated team workers and 3,000 clock-watchers is everything.
So the first thing I try to do in my fairness crusade is to try to take myself out of the equation.
That means being aware of my own biases.
For example, I really like people who say yes to whatever I suggest.
(Laughter)
But that's not very good for the company and not very good for anyone who has different ideas.
So we try to actively promote a culture of diversity of opinions and diversity of character.
The second thing we do is a little more procedural.
We look at all the rules, the processes, the systems in the company, the ones we use to take decisions and allocate resources, and we try to get rid of anything that's not very clear, not very rational, doesn't make sense, and we also try to fix anything that's limiting the transfer of information within the company.
We then look at the culture and the motivation for the same reasons.
But my point is that however hard you look at the rules, the processes, the systems -- and we have to do that -- but however hard we look, we're never going to do enough to get to the real essence of fairness.
That's because the last mile of fairness requires something else. It's about what people's emotions are, what their needs are, what's going on in their private lives, what society needs.
These are all questions and elements that are very hard to put into a spreadsheet, into an algorithm.
It's very hard to make them part of our rational decision.
But if we miss these, we're missing key important points, and the outcome is likely to feel unfair.
So we should cross-check our decisions with our fairness center switched on.
Is it right that this guy should get the job he's really hoping to get?
Is it right that this guy should be fired?
Is it right that we should be charging so much for this product?
These are tough questions.
But if we take the time to ask ourselves whether the rational answer is the right one ... we all know deep inside what the answer is.
We've known since we were babies.
And to know what the right answer is is pretty cool for decision-making.
And if we turn on our hearts, that's the key to getting the real best out of people, because they can smell it if you care, and only when you really care will they leave their fears behind and bring their true selves to work.
So if fairness is a keystone of life, why isn't every leader making it their priority?
Wouldn't it be cool to work in a company that was more fair?
Wouldn't it be great to have colleagues and bosses that were selected and trained for fairness and for character and not based on 60-year-old GMATs?
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to knock on the door of a Chief Fairness Officer?
We'll get there, but why is it not happening now?
Well, partly, it's because of inertia, partly, it's because fairness isn't always easy.
It requires judgment and risk.
Drilling that eighth well was a risk.
Promoting the guy who didn't finish high school was a risk.
Building a cheese factory in Ecuador was a risk.
But fairness is a risk worth taking, so we should be asking ourselves, where can we take this risk?
Where can we push ourselves a little bit further, to go beyond what's rational and do what's right?
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, what is capitalism? Capitalism, fundamentally, is a series of marketplaces.
You can have a marketplace for lemonade, a marketplace for lemons, a marketplace for trucks that transport lemons, a marketplace that fuels those trucks, marketplaces that sell wood to build lemonade stands.
However, capitalism of course, as we know, is this either celebrated term or condemned term.
It's either revered or it's reviled.
And I'm here to argue that this is because capitalism, in the modern iteration, is largely misunderstood.
In my view, capitalism should not be thought of as an ideology, but instead should be thought of as an operating system.
Think of your iPhone.
Your iPhone merges hardware with software. Apps and hardware. Now think about all the hardware as the physical reality all around you, and think of the apps as entrepreneurial activity, creative energy.
And in-between, you have an operating system.
As you have advances in hardware, you have advances in software.
And the operating system needs to keep up. It needs to be patched, it needs to be updated, new releases have to happen.
And all of these things have to happen symbiotically.
The operating system needs to keep getting more and more advanced to keep up with innovation.
And this is why, fundamentally, when you think about it as an operating system, it devolves the language of ideology away from what traditional defenders of capitalism think.
But even if you go to the constitution, you'll notice, before the founders even got to the First Amendment — with free speech, free religion, free press, they thought about patents and copyright.
They talked about the government's role in promoting arts and sciences.
It's the reason why I could not start a search engine tomorrow called Goggle.
(Laughter)
Google doesn't own Gs, but I couldn't do it because there could be some confusion.
So even property rights have ambiguity built into them.
And on and on.
And by 1900, you have other types of property that come into being.
For instance, imagine that in 1900, you owned 100 acres of land someplace in the Midwest.
It's very easy to see where your fence ends, your neighbor's property begins.
Now let me ask you, where in the sky does your property end?
Does it end at 1,000 feet, 5,000 feet, 10,000 feet?
It makes no difference, because other than the novelty of a few hot-air balloons, man couldn't fly.
But within three years, he could.
5,000 feet, 10,000 feet? Now all of a sudden, it was very much relevant whether your land ends at 1,000 feet in the sky,
And you have to have someone arbitrate that.
And indeed, that's exactly what happened.
And five or ten years from now, when Amazon wants to deliver a package over your house to your neighbor from that UPS truck, we're going to have to decide: Does you property end at five feet, 10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet? Where does it end? And there is no ideology that will tell you where your property ends.
It's an operating system.
And similarly, we're going to see this with automobiles.
A few years after the Wright brothers figured out flight, human beings started using more and more cars.
And all of a sudden, the regulatory system -- the operating system -- had to be patched to all of a sudden address the safety of consumers.
That the consumers of vehicles were presenting danger to horses, other pedestrians, trolleys, what have you.
And all of a sudden, the drivers of these automobiles had to have driver's licenses, eye exams, registered motor vehicles, speed limits, rules of the road, so that horses, pedestrians, could coexist with cars.
It had to be backwards compatible.
So a new invention had to basically fit advances from the past.
Similarly, five or ten years from now, we're going to see the same thing with self-driving cars -- coexisting with human-driven cars.
The reason why this is important, is in 10 years, another thing is going to happen beyond drones and self-driving cars, but you're going to see the most valuable economy in the world -- the largest economy in the world -- is going to be a country run by communists.
The Chinese seem to be very good at capitalism.
And this is going to have fundamental problems and present an identity crisis for the United States.
Because for a long time, free markets coincided with liberties such as free speech, free press, free religion.
And all of a sudden, this equation is going to be decoupled.
And when it gets decoupled, we might find that democracy, the multitude of voices, actually impedes capitalism because a state that does not have any pretense of limited government can very quickly mandate a regulatory framework for drones, for electric cars, for self-driving cars, for any new innovation where they feel that they can leapfrog Western societies.
And this is a very unique thing in the American experience.
And this is why it's very important to think of American capitalism as an operating system and not as an ideology.
Because when you think about it as an ideology, you can have good politics make for very, very bad policy.
That market outcomes and democratic voices and battles for votes can end up stifling progress.
So over the next few years, as this political cycle plays out, you're going to see American democracy rise to meet the challenges that capitalism poses and modernity poses.
And I ask policymakers to think about -- decoupling ideology from economics, and think about how good policy can ultimately become good politics.
Thank you.
(Applause)
A few years ago, I found myself looking for the most cost-effective way to be stylish.
So naturally, I wound up at my local thrift store, a wonderland of other people's trash that was ripe to be plucked to become my treasure.
Now, I wasn't just looking for your average off-the-secondhand-rack vintage T-shirt to wear.
For me, real style lives at the intersection of design and individuality.
So to make sure that I was getting the most out of the things I was finding, I bought a sewing machine so I could tailor the 90's-style garments that I was finding, to fit a more contemporary aesthetic.
I've been tailoring and making my own clothes from scratch ever since, so everything in my closet is uniquely my own.
But as I was sorting through the endless racks of clothes at these thrift stores, I started to ask myself, what happens to all the clothes that I don't buy?
The stuff that isn't really cool or trendy but kind of just sits there and rots away at these secondhand stores.
I work in the fashion industry on the wholesale side, and I started to see some of the products that we sell end up on the racks of these thrift stores.
So the question started to work its way into my work life, as well.
I did some research and I pretty quickly found a very scary supply chain that led me to some pretty troubling realities.
It turned out that the clothes I was sorting though at these thrift stores represented only a small fraction of the total amount of garments that we dispose of each year.
In the US, only 15 percent of the total textile and garment waste that's generated each year ends up being donated or recycled in some way, which means that the other 85 percent of textile and garment waste end up in landfills every year.
Now, I want to put this into perspective, because I don't quite think that the 85 percent does the problem justice.
This means that almost 13 million tons of clothing and textile waste end up in landfills every year in just the United States alone. This averages out to be roughly 200 T-shirts per person ending up in the garbage.
In Canada, we throw away enough clothing to fill the largest stadium in my home town of Toronto, one that seats 60,000 people, with a mountain of clothes three times the size of that stadium.
Now, even with this, I still think that Canadians are the more polite North Americans, so don't hold it against us.
(Laughter)
What was even more surprising was seeing that the fashion industry is the second-largest polluter in the world behind the oil and gas industry.
This is an important comparison to make.
I don't want to defend the oil and gas industry but I'd be lying if I said I was surprised to hear they were the number one polluter.
I just assumed, fairly or not, that that's an industry that doesn't really mind sticking to the status quo.
One where the technology doesn't really change and the focus is more so on driving profitability at the expense of a sustainable future.
But I was really surprised to see that the fashion industry was number two.
Because maintaining that status quo is the opposite of what the fashion industry stands for.
The unfortunate reality is, not only do we waste a lot of the things we do consume, but we also use a lot to produce the clothes that we buy each year.
On average, a household's purchase of clothing per year requires 1,000 bathtubs of water to produce.
A thousand bathtubs of water per household, per year.
That's a lot of water.
It seems that the industry that always has been and probably always will be on the forefront of design, creates products that are designed to be comfortable, designed to be trendy and designed to be expressive but aren't really designed to be sustainable or recyclable for that matter.
But I think that can change.
I think the fashion industry's aptitude for change is the exact thing that should make it patient zero for sustainable business practices.
And I think to get started, all we have to do is start to design clothes to be recyclable at the end of their life.
Now, designing recyclable clothing is definitely something to leave to the professionals. But as a 24-year-old thrift store aficionado armed with a sewing machine, if I were to very humbly posit one perspective, it would be to approach clothing design kind of like building with Lego.
When we put together a brick of Lego, it's very strong but very easily manipulated. It's modular in its nature.
Clothing design as it stands today is very rarely modular.
Take this motorcycle jacket as an example.
It's a pretty standard jacket with its buttons, zippers and trim.
But in order for us to efficiently recycle a jacket like this, we need to be able to easily remove these items and quickly get down to just the fabric.
Once we have just the fabric, we're able to break it down by shredding it and getting back to thread level, make new thread that then gets made into new fabric and ultimately new clothing, whether it be a new jacket or new T-shirts, for example.
But the complexity lies with all of these extra items, the buttons, the zippers and the trim.
Because in reality, these items are actually quite difficult to remove.
So in many cases it requires more time or more money to disassemble a jacket like this. In some cases, it's just more cost-effective to throw it away rather than recycle it.
But I think this can change if we design clothes in a modular way to be easily disassembled at the end of their lives.
We could redesign this jacket to have a hidden wireframe, kind of like the skeleton of a fish, that holds all important items together.
This invisible fish-bone structure can have all of these extra items, the zippers and the buttons and the trim, sewn into it and then attached to the fabric.
So at the end of the jacket's life, all you have to do is remove its fish bone and the fabric comes with it a lot quicker and a lot easier than before.
Now, recycling clothing is definitely one piece of the puzzle.
But if we want to take fixing the environmental impact that the fashion industry has more seriously, then we need to take this to the next step and start to design clothes to also be compostable at the end of their lives. For most of the types of clothes we have in our closet the average lifespan is about three years.
Now, I'm sure there's many of us that have gems in our drawers that are much older than that, which is great.
Because being able to extend the life of a garment by even only nine months reduces the waste and water impact that that garment has by 20 to 30 percent.
But fashion is fashion.
Which means that styles are always going to change and you're probably going to be wearing something different than you were today eight seasons from now, no matter how environmentally friendly you want to be.
But lucky for us, there are some items that never go out of style.
I'm talking about your basics -- your socks, underwear, even your pajamas.
We're all guilty of wearing these items right down to the bone, and in many cases throwing them in the garbage because it's really difficult to donate your old ratty socks that have holes in them to your local thrift store.
But what if we were able to compost these items rather than throw them in the trash bin?
The environmental savings could be huge, and all we would have to do is start to shift more of our resources to start to produce more of these items using more natural fibers, like 100 percent organic cotton.
Now, recycling and composting are two critical priorities.
But one other thing that we have to rethink is the way that we dye our clothes.
Currently, 10 to 20 percent of the harsh chemical dye that we use end up in water bodies that neighbor production hubs in developing nations.
The tricky thing is that these harsh chemicals are really effective at keeping a garment a specific color for a long period of time.
It's these harsh chemicals that keep that bright red dress bright red for so many years.
But what if we were able to use something different?
What if we were able to use something that we all have in our kitchen cabinets at home to dye our clothes?
What if we were able to use spices and herbs to dye our clothes?
There's countless food options that would allow for us to stain material, but these stains change color over time. This would be pretty different than the clothes that were dyed harshly with chemicals that we're used to.
But dyeing clothes naturally this way would allow for us to make sure they're more unique and environmentally friendlier. Let's think about it.
Fashion today is all about individuality.
It's about managing your own personal appearance to be just unique enough to be cool.
These days, everybody has the ability to showcase their brand their personal style, across the world, through social media. The pocket-sized billboards that we flick through on our Instagram feeds are chock-full of models and taste-makers that are showcasing their individuality through their personal microbrands.
But what could be more personalized, more unique, than clothes that change color over time?
Clothes that with each wash and with each wear become more and more one of a kind.
People have been buying and wearing ripped jeans for years. So this would just be another example of clothes that exist in our wardrobe that evolve with us over our lives.
This shirt, for example, is one that, much to the dismay of my mother and the state of her kitchen, I dyed at home, using turmeric, before coming here today.
This shirt is something that none of my friends are going to have on their Instagram feed.
So it's unique, but more importantly, it's naturally dyed.
Now, I'm not suggesting that everybody dye their clothes in their kitchen sink at home.
But if we were able to apply this or a similar process on a commercial scale, then our need to rely on these harsh chemical dyes for our clothes could be easily reduced.
The 2.4-trillion-dollar fashion industry is fiercely competitive.
So the business that can provide a product at scale while also promising its customers that each and every garment will become more unique over time will have a serious competitive advantage.
Brands have been playing with customization for years. The rise of e-commerce services, like Indochino, a bespoke suiting platform, and Tinker Tailor, a bespoke dress-making platform, have made customization possible from your couch.
Nike and Adidas have been mastering their online shoe customization platforms for years.
Providing individuality at scale is a challenge that most consumer-facing businesses encounter.
So being able to tackle this while also providing an environmentally friendly product could lead to a pretty seismic industry shift. And at that point, it's not just about doing what's best for our environment but also what's best for the bottom line.
There's no fix-all, and there's no one-step solution.
But we can get started by designing clothes with their death in mind.
The fashion industry is the perfect industry to experiment with and embrace change that can one day get us to the sustainable future we so desperately need.
Thank you.

I'm Chris Nowinski, and odds are if you've met me in the last five years I've asked you, after a few minutes, a bit of an odd question: Can I have your brain?
Now, it only seems like a strange question if you don't know my story so please let me share it with you.
I grew up outside of Chicago, and I was an athlete and I was very lucky to get recruited to play football at Harvard University.
So that's me.
So that's also me. (Laughter)
Sure you remember me from Monday Night Raw in 2002 and 2003, and I had a blast playing what people affectionately like to call Chris Harvard, the Ivy League snob.
(Laughter)
It was perfect for me.
But unfortunately, I got kicked in the head by my colleague Bubba Ray Dudley, and I suffered a severe concussion.
And it led to what became permanent postconcussion symptoms: constant headaches, inability to sleep, depression, feeling in a fog.
And in that first year, I tried to figure out how could I make this pain go away.
And I wasn't getting the answers I needed from doctors, and so I started digging into the medical literature.
And I found there's this whole story about concussions that we weren't really being told.
So I decided to write a book about it, called "Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis" that came out in 2006.
But in that process, I learned it's not really just about concussions.
I learned about a disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE.
What we used to call punch-drunk, because we only knew about it from boxers.
We knew that getting hit in the head too many times with boxers would cause their brain to essentially start to rot, to degenerate.
And they'd have symptoms like memory problems and problems with cognition, depression, impulse control issues, aggression.
So basically, I got ... I got injured at the right time, in which the first two NFL players were studied for this disease.
And it turned out they both had it.
The first was Mike Webster, 50 years old, already had dementia.
The second, Terry Long, 45 years old when he took his life.
The medical examiner in Pittsburgh decided to look at their brains and found this disease.
I wrote a chapter about it, and I thought people would make a big deal out of it.
But shockingly, even when the first two cases came in positive, there was never a national news story about this, what's going on in football with these cases of CTE.
So the book comes out, not a whole lot is happening, and one day I read the newspaper -- November 20, 2006.
I find out that Andre Waters just took his life.
Those of you who know football, Andre Waters was someone I grew up watching.
Former Philadelphia Eagles strong safety, [44] years old, a Division II football coach when he decided to put a gun to his head.
In the article they reminded me, his nickname was Dirty Waters.
He was known for leading with his head, so I thought I'm just going to look up did he ever talk about the concussions he had.
And I found a quote from 1994 where Andre Waters said, "I stopped counting my concussions at 15.
I wouldn't say anything, I'd just sniff smelling salts and go back out there." And I thought, I wonder if he might have CTE, too.
If that might have contributed to whatever made him choose to end his life. So I ended up calling the doctor who did the first two studies, and I said, "Hey, I think you should study Andre Waters." And he said, "I'd be happy to.
The problem is, the first two cases died in the county in which I work, and I could study them as part of my job.
I can't do that with Andre Waters, he died in Florida.
If you want me to study him, you're going to have to figure out how to get me the brain. "So I said," OK.
How does one get a brain?"
(Laughter) So I racked my brain and I thought, why don't I call the medical examiner who I think has the brain right now?
So I called up the medical examiner in Florida, and I said, "Hey, you don't know me, but do you still have the brain of Andre Waters?"
(Laughter)
And he said, "Yes, I do." I said, "OK, are you going to study him for CTE?" And he said no, in fact at that time he didn't believe that was a real disease.
I said, "OK, if you're not, do you mind if I have it?" And he said, "Well, young man, I can't give you the brain.
You need his family's permission.
But if you do get the permission of his next of kin, I will release the brain to you. "And I said," Great! "And then I realized I had to figure out who his next of kin was and ask them, and it turned out it was Andre Waters's 88-year-old mother.
And I sat there, and I took a breath and I thought, "Am I really going to cold-call an 88-year-old grieving mother who just lost her son to suicide?" And almost everything in me said, "Don't do it.
It's too much to put this poor woman through, she's been through so much already." But then this other voice in my head said, "You know what?
If guys are killing themselves from this disease and we could study it to maybe prevent this from happening in the future, sometimes you've just got to suck it up and do something that's very hard."
So I called her. First time, nobody answered.
Second time, no one answered, third... no voice mails.
The fifth time, I got an answer.
And thank God that Andre Waters's family was so gracious about the call and said, "You know what, we want to know what happened to Andre. We want to know why he changed so much in the last five years of his life." And so we studied the brain, and it turned out that he did have CTE.
He became the third NFL player diagnosed with the disease.
This is what it looks like.
He was somewhere between mild and severe.
OK, we have three of three NFL players here. Maybe this needs to get a little bit more serious.
Maybe something's happening here.
So I ended up starting the Concussion Legacy Foundation, actually formalized the work, so it wasn't just some guy calling for brains.
And I searched the world. And I put together the best research team I could find.
So we partnered with Boston University, we partnered with scientists at the VA here in Boston, and we started a brain bank.
Turns out, if you want to know how to cure degenerative brain disease, you have to start by actually studying the brains.
At this point, we were the first center in the world focused on CTE. It just had not been studied formally.
And so we start this brain bank, and it's my job to get the brains for Dr. Ann McKee and her brain bank, right in the middle.
We also work with Dr. Bob Stern, Dr. Robert Cantu, truly my dream team of scientists that I support.
So my job is to get the brains.
And I was very successful in those early years.
Since 2007 I've started every day by reading the obituaries.
And it's a tough way to live.
And it's hard on me and it's even worse on these poor families that I've been calling for the last 10 years, to ask for their brains.
And so early on in the process, as it started to really eat away at me, I decided, you know what, can I find another way to get people to donate their brains to this research?
And I figured out, what if we could create a culture of brain donation in this country?
What if it became normal for athletes to donate their brain after they died?
And so what I started was a brain donation registry.
And I started asking athletes if they would publicly pledge to donate their brain to science.
And it started with, actually, a hockey player in 2009.
One of my first pledges was a former Harvard hockey player, Noah Welch, who was in the NHL at the time.
It was a slow start people understanding what this was about.
So when the news hit the front page, "Noah Welch pledging his brain to science," he said he went to the locker room the next day, one of his teammates pulled him aside and said, "Hey, I heard you're donating your brain to science." And he said, "Yep." And he said, "Wow.
How many games are you going to miss? "
(Laughter) True story. (Laughter)
But we've been remarkably successful -- over 2,500 athletes have signed up.
They get a brain-donation card they keep in their wallet. This is mine, I was obviously first, it says 01.
And I will donate my brain to this.
We've also been lucky to have people like Brandi Chastain, the women's soccer icon, NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr.
Just two weeks ago, Hall-of-Famer Nick Buoniconti who had been diagnosed with dementia, signed up to pledge his brain. So it's been wonderful, and the great thing about it is that it has worked in changing how we're able to get brains.
So now, instead of me having to call, more families call us.
And our phones ring off the hook.
And so I can now focus on taking this information, figuring out how do we work towards a cure, how do we work towards prevention, and so my life has gotten a lot easier.
This is just some of the headlines that we've able to get over the years from athletes pledging their brain.
The problem has been what we learned.
So when we started this, only 45 cases existed in the world of this disease that had been studied in brain banks.
Since then, we have acquired 500 brains and found over 300 of them had CTE.
To put that in perspective, the rest of the world has not studied 100 brains since we started this.
What we've seen though is very frightening.
So some of you might have seen the headline in July in the "New York Times." And a recent study we published, that of the first 111 NFL players we looked at 110 were positive for this disease.
Of the first 53 college football players we looked at, 48 had this disease.
That's something that's a very big concern to me.
And so now, I'm very much focused on what can we do to actually treat this disease?
We still can't diagnose CTE in living people, we have no treatments that are going to be coming out of the pharmaceutical industry in the next five years.
This is a long, long fight.
But our Concussion Legacy Foundation is here to not only facilitate this work, and that's the long game, but the short game is, hey, we can prevent this.
We can prevent this disease if we just stopped hitting people in the head so much.
And frankly, we need to stop hitting children in the head.
Turns out, it's not a great idea to hit a five-year-old in the head 500 times each year.
And it does actually open up the door to this disease.
And so, we've got a lot of work ahead of us. But I have great hope that we're on our way to curing this disease.
But I hope you understand my story a little more now.
Can I have your brain? And now that we've gotten to know each other a little bit better, this is the time where I ask you,
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I started teaching MBA students 17 years ago.
Sometimes I run into my students years later.
And when I run into them, a funny thing happens.
I don't remember just their faces; I also remember where exactly in the classroom they were sitting.
And I remember who they were sitting with as well.
This is not because I have any special superpowers of memory.
The reason I can remember them is because they are creatures of habit.
They are sitting with their favorite people in their favorite seats.
They find their twins, they stay with them for the whole year.
Now, the danger of this for my students is they're at risk of leaving the university with just a few people who are exactly like them.
They're going to squander their chance for an international, diverse network.
How could this happen to them?
My students are open-minded.
They come to business school precisely so that they can get great networks.
Now, all of us socially narrow in our lives, in our school, in work, and so I want you to think about this one.
How many of you here brought a friend along for this talk?
I want you to look at your friend a little bit.
Are they of the same nationality as you?
Are they of the same gender as you?
Are they of the same race? Really look at them closely. Don't they kind of look like you as well?
(Laughter)
The muscle people are together, and the people with the same hairstyles and the checked shirts.
We all do this in life.
We all do it in life, and in fact, there's nothing wrong with this.
It makes us comfortable to be around people who are similar.
The problem is when we're on a precipice, right?
When we're in trouble, when we need new ideas, when we need new jobs, when we need new resources -- this is when we really pay a price for living in a clique.
Mark Granovetter, the sociologist, had a famous paper "The Strength of Weak Ties," and what he did in this paper is he asked people how they got their jobs.
And what he learned was that most people don't get their jobs through their strong ties -- their father, their mother, their significant other. They instead get jobs through weak ties, people who they just met.
So if you think about what the problem is with your strong ties, think about your significant other, for example.
The network is redundant.
Everybody that they know, you know.
Or I hope you know them. Right? Your weak ties -- people you just met today -- they are your ticket to a whole new social world.
The thing is that we have this amazing ticket to travel our social worlds, but we don't use it very well.
Sometimes we stay awfully close to home.
And today, what I want to talk about is: What are those habits that keep human beings so close to home, and how can we be a little bit more intentional about traveling our social universe?
So let's look at the first strategy. The first strategy is to use a more imperfect social search engine.
What I mean by a social search engine is how you are finding and filtering your friends.
And so people always tell me, "I want to get lucky through the network.
I want to get a new job. I want to get a great opportunity." And I say, "Well, that's really hard, because your networks are so fundamentally predictable." Map out your habitual daily footpath, and what you'll probably discover is that you start at home, you go to your school or your workplace, you maybe go up the same staircase or elevator, you go to the bathroom -- the same bathroom -- and the same stall in that bathroom, you end up in the gym, then you come right back home.
It's like stops on a train schedule. It's that predictable. It's efficient, but the problem is, you're seeing exactly the same people.
Make your network slightly more inefficient.
Go to a bathroom on a different floor.
You encounter a whole new network of people.
The other side of it is how we are actually filtering.
And we do this automatically.
The minute we meet someone, we are looking at them, we meet them, we are initially seeing, "You're interesting." "You're not interesting." "You're relevant." We do this automatically. We can't even help it.
And what I want to encourage you to do instead is to fight your filters.
I want you to take a look around this room, and I want you to identify the least interesting person that you see, and I want you to connect with them over the next coffee break.
And I want you to go even further than that.
What I want you to do is find the most irritating person you see as well and connect with them.
What you are doing with this exercise is you are forcing yourself to see what you don't want to see, to connect with who you don't want to connect with, to widen your social world.
To truly widen, what we have to do is, we've got to fight our sense of choice.
We've got to fight our choices.
And my students hate this, but you know what I do?
I won't let them sit in their favorite seats. I move them around from seat to seat.
I force them to work with different people so there are more accidental bumps in the network where people get a chance to connect with each other.
And we studied exactly this kind of an intervention at Harvard University.
At Harvard, when you look at the rooming groups, there's freshman rooming groups, people are not choosing those roommates.
They're of all different races, all different ethnicities.
Maybe people are initially uncomfortable with those roommates, but the amazing thing is, at the end of a year with those students, they're able to overcome that initial discomfort.
They're able to find deep-level commonalities with people.
So the takeaway here is not just "take someone out to coffee." It's a little more subtle.
It's "go to the coffee room." When researchers talk about social hubs, what makes a social hub so special is you can't choose; you can't predict who you're going to meet in that place.
And so with these social hubs, the paradox is, interestingly enough, to get randomness, it requires, actually, some planning.
In one university that I worked at, there was a mail room on every single floor.
What that meant is that the only people who would bump into each other are those who are actually on that floor and who are bumping into each other anyway.
At another university I worked at, there was only one mail room, so all the faculty from all over that building would run into each other in that social hub.
A simple change in planning, a huge difference in the traffic of people and the accidental bumps in the network.
Here's my question for you: What are you doing that breaks you from your social habits?
Where do you find yourself in places where you get injections of unpredictable diversity?
And my students give me some wonderful examples.
They tell me when they're doing pickup basketball games, or my favorite example is when they go to a dog park.
They tell me it's even better than online dating when they're there.
So the real thing that I want you to think about is we've got to fight our filters.
We've got to make ourselves a little more inefficient, and by doing so, we are creating a more imprecise social search engine.
And you're creating that randomness, that luck that is going to cause you to widen your travels, through your social universe.
But in fact, there's more to it than that.
Sometimes we actually buy ourselves a second-class ticket to travel our social universe.
We are not courageous when we reach out to people.
Let me give you an example of that.
A few years ago, I had a very eventful year.
That year, I managed to lose a job, I managed to get a dream job overseas and accept it, I had a baby the next month, I got very sick, I was unable to take the dream job.
And so in a few weeks, what ended up happening was, I lost my identity as a faculty member, and I got a very stressful new identity as a mother.
What I also got was tons of advice from people.
And the advice I despised more than any other advice was, "You've got to go network with everybody." When your psychological world is breaking down, the hardest thing to do is to try and reach out and build up your social world.
And so we studied exactly this idea on a much larger scale.
What we did was we looked at high and low socioeconomic status people, and we looked at them in two situations.
We looked at them first in a baseline condition, when they were quite comfortable.
And what we found was that our lower socioeconomic status people, when they were comfortable, were actually reaching out to more people.
They thought of more people.
They were also less constrained in how they were networking.
They were thinking of more diverse people than the higher-status people.
Then we asked them to think about maybe losing a job. We threatened them. And once they thought about that, the networks they generated completely differed.
The lower socioeconomic status people reached inwards.
They thought of fewer people.
They thought of less-diverse people.
The higher socioeconomic status people thought of more people, they thought of a broader network, they were positioning themselves to bounce back from that setback.
Let's consider what this actually means.
Imagine that you were being spontaneously unfriended by everyone in your network other than your mom, your dad and your dog.
(Laughter)
This is essentially what we are doing at these moments when we need our networks the most.
Imagine — this is what we're doing.
We're doing it to ourselves.
We are mentally compressing our networks when we are being harassed, when we are being bullied, when we are threatened about losing a job, when we feel down and weak.
We are closing ourselves off, isolating ourselves, creating a blind spot where we actually don't see our resources.
We don't see our allies, we don't see our opportunities.
How can we overcome this? Two simple strategies. One strategy is simply to look at your list of Facebook friends and LinkedIn friends just so you remind yourself of people who are there beyond those that automatically come to mind.
And in our own research, one of the things we did was, we considered Claude Steele's research on self-affirmation: simply thinking about your own values, networking from a place of strength.
What Leigh Thompson, Hoon-Seok Choi and I were able to do is, we found that people who had affirmed themselves first were able to take advice from people who would otherwise be threatening to them.
Here's a last exercise. I want you to look in your email in-box, and I want you to look at the last time you asked somebody for a favor.
And I want you to look at the language that you used.
Did you say things like, "Oh, you're a great resource," or "I owe you one," "I'm obligated to you." All of this language represents a metaphor.
It's a metaphor of economics, of a balance sheet, of accounting, of transactions.
And when we think about human relations in a transactional way, it is fundamentally uncomfortable to us as human beings.
We must think about human relations and reaching out to people in more humane ways.
Here's an idea as to how to do so.
Look at words like "please," "thank you," "you're welcome" in other languages.
Look at the literal translation of these words.
Each of these words is a word that helps us impose upon other people in our social networks.
And so, the word "thank you," if you look at it in Spanish, Italian, French, "gracias," "grazie," "merci" in French.
Each of them are "grace" and "mercy." They are godly words.
There's nothing economic or transactional about those words.
The word "you're welcome" is interesting.
The great persuasion theorist Robert Cialdini says we've got to get our favors back.
So we need to emphasize the transaction a little bit more.
He says, "Let's not say 'You're welcome.' Instead say, 'I know you'd do the same for me.'" But sometimes it may be helpful to not think in transactional ways, to eliminate the transaction, to make it a little bit more invisible.
And in fact, if you look in Chinese, the word "bú kè qì" in Chinese, "You're welcome," means, "Don't be formal; we're family.
We don't need to go through those formalities. "And" kembali "in Indonesian is" Come back to me. "When you say" You're welcome "next time, think about how you can maybe eliminate the transaction and instead strengthen that social tie.
Maybe "It's great to collaborate," or "That's what friends are for."
I want you to think about how you think about this ticket that you have to travel your social universe.
Here's one metaphor.
It's a common metaphor: "Life is a journey." Right?
It's a train ride, and you're a passenger on the train, and there are certain people with you.
Certain people get on this train, and some stay with you, some leave at different stops, new ones may enter.
I love this metaphor, it's a beautiful one.
But I want you to consider a different metaphor.
This one is passive, being a passenger on that train, and it's quite linear.
You're off to some particular destination.
Why not instead think of yourself as an atom, bumping up against other atoms, maybe transferring energy with them, bonding with them a little and maybe creating something new on your travels through the social universe.
Thank you so much. And I hope we bump into each other again.
(Applause)
On a warm August morning in Harare, Farai, a 24-year-old mother of two, walks towards a park bench.
She looks miserable and dejected.
Now, on the park bench sits an 82-year-old woman, better known to the community as Grandmother Jack.
Farai hands Grandmother Jack an envelope from the clinic nurse.
Grandmother Jack invites Farai to sit down as she opens the envelope and reads.
There's silence for three minutes or so as she reads.
And after a long pause, Grandmother Jack takes a deep breath, looks at Farai and says, "I'm here for you.
Would you like to share your story with me?"
Farai begins, her eyes swelling with tears.
She says, "Grandmother Jack, I'm HIV-positive.
I've been living with HIV for the past four years.
My husband left me a year ago.
I have two kids under the age of five. I'm unemployed. I can hardly take care of my children."
Tears are now flowing down her face.
And in response, Grandmother Jack moves closer, puts her hand on Farai, and says, "Farai, it's OK to cry.
You've been through a lot.
Would you like to share more with me?"
And Farai continues. "In the last three weeks, I have had recurrent thoughts of killing myself, taking my two children with me.
I can't take it anymore.
The clinic nurse sent me to see you." There's an exchange between the two, which lasts about 30 minutes.
And finally, Grandmother Jack says, "Farai, it seems to me that you have all the symptoms of kufungisisa."
The word "kufungisisa" opens up a floodgate of tears.
So, kufungisisa is the local equivalent of depression in my country.
It literally means "thinking too much." The World Health Organization estimates that more than 300 million people globally, today, suffer from depression, or what in my country we call kufungisisa.
And the World Health Organization also tells us that every 40 seconds, someone somewhere in the world commits suicide because they are unhappy, largely due to depression or kufungisisa.
And most of these deaths are occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
In fact, the World Health Organization goes as far as to say that when you look at the age group between 15 to 29, a leading cause of death now is actually suicide.
But there are wider events that lead to depression and in some cases, suicide, such as abuse, conflict, violence, isolation, loneliness -- the list is endless.
But one thing that we do know is that depression can be treated and suicides averted.
But the problem is we just don't have enough psychiatrists or psychologists in the world to do the job.
In most low- and middle-income countries, for instance, the ratio of psychiatrists to the population is something like one for every one and a half million people, which literally means that 90 percent of the people needing mental health services will not get it.
In my country, there are 12 psychiatrists, and I'm one of them, for a population of approximately 14 million.
Now, let me just put that into context.
One evening while I was at home, I get a call from the ER, or the emergency room, from a city which is some 200 kilometers away from where I live.
And the ER doctor says, "One of your patients, someone you treated four months ago, has just taken an overdose, and they are in the ER department.
Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK, but they will need neuropsychiatric evaluation." Now, I obviously can't get into my car in the middle of the night and drive 200 kilometers.
So as best as we could, over the phone with the ER doctor, we come up with an assessment.
We ensure that suicidal observations are in place.
We ensure that we start reviewing the antidepressants that this patient has been taking, and we finally conclude that as soon as Erica -- that was her name, 26-year-old -- as soon as Erica is ready to be released from the ER, she should come directly to me with her mother, and I will evaluate and establish what can be done.
And we assumed that that would take about a week. A week passes. Three weeks pass. No Erica. And one day I get a call from Erica's mother, and she says, "Erica committed suicide three days ago.
She hanged herself from the mango tree in the family garden." Now, almost like a knee-jerk reaction, I couldn't help but ask, "But why didn't you come to Harare, where I live?
We had agreed that as soon as you're released from the ER, you will come to me." Her response was brief. "We didn't have the 15 dollars bus fare to come to Harare."
Now, suicide is not an unusual event in the world of mental health.
But there was something about Erica's death that struck me at the core of my very being.
That statement from Erica's mother: "We didn't have 15 dollars bus fare to come to you," made me realize that it just wasn't going to work, me expecting people to come to me.
And I got into this state of soul-searching, trying to really discover my role as a psychiatrist in Africa.
And after considerable consultation and soul-searching, talking to colleagues, friends and family, it suddenly dawned on me that actually, one the most reliable resources we have in Africa are grandmothers. Yes, grandmothers. And I thought, grandmothers are in every community.
There are hundreds of them. And --
(Laughter)
And they don't leave their communities in search of greener pastures.
(Laughter)
See, the only time they leave is when they go to a greener pasture called heaven.
(Laughter)
So I thought, how about training grandmothers in evidence-based talk therapy, which they can deliver on a bench?
Empower them with the skills to listen, to show empathy, all of that rooted in cognitive behavioral therapy; empower them with the skills to provide behavior activation, activity scheduling; and support them using digital technology. You know, mobile phone technology. Pretty much everyone in Africa has a mobile phone today.
So in 2006, I started my first group of grandmothers.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Today, there are hundreds of grandmothers who are working in more than 70 communities.
And in the last year alone, more than 30,000 people received treatment on the Friendship Bench from a grandmother in a community in Zimbabwe.
(Applause)
And -- And recently, we published this work that is done by these grandmothers in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
(Applause)
And our results show that six months after receiving treatment from a grandmother, people were still symptom-free: no depression, suicidal ideation completely reduced.
In fact, our results — this was a clinical trial — in fact, this clinical trial showed that grandmothers were more effective at treating depression than doctors and —
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And so, we're now working towards expanding this program.
There are more than 600 million people currently aged above 65 in the world.
And by the year 2050, there will be 1.5 billion people aged 65 and above.
Imagine if we could create a global network of grandmothers in every major city in the world, who are trained in evidence-based talk therapy, supported through digital platforms, networked.
And they will make a difference in communities.
They will reduce the treatment gap for mental, neurological and substance-use disorders.
Finally, this is a file photograph of Grandmother Jack.
So, Farai had six sessions on the bench with Grandmother Jack.
Today, Farai is employed.
She has her two children at school.
And as for Grandmother Jack, one morning in February, we expected her to see her 257th client on the bench.
She didn't show up.
She had gone to a greener pasture called heaven.
But I believe that Grandmother Jack, from up there, she's cheering on all the other grandmothers — the increasing number of grandmothers who are making a difference in the lives of thousands of people.
And I'm sure she's in awe when she realizes that something that she helped to pioneer is now spreading to other countries, like Malawi, the island of Zanzibar and coming closer to home here in the Unites States in the city of New York.
May her soul rest in peace.
Thank you.
Currently, most refugees live in the cities rather than in the refugee camps.
We represent over 60 percent of the number of refugees globally.
With the majority of refugees living in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and new thinking.
Rather than wasting money on building walls, it would be better to spend on programs to help refugees to help themselves.
(Applause)
We always have to leave behind all our possessions. But not our skills and knowledge.
If allowed to live a productive life, refugees can help themselves and contribute to the development of their host country.
I was born in the city called Bukavu, South Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I am the fifth-born in a family of 12 children.
My father, a mechanic by profession, worked very hard to send me to school.
Just like other young people, I had a lot of plans and dreams.
I wanted to complete my studies, get a nice job, marry and have my own children and support my family.
But this didn't happen.
War in my homeland forced me to flee to Uganda in 2008, nine years ago.
My family joined a steady exodus of refugees who settled in Uganda's capital, Kampala.
In my country, I lived already in the city, and we felt Kampala was much better than a refugee camp.
Refugees in the cities have always been denied international assistance, even after their recognition by UNHCR in 1997.
In addition to the poverty problem we were confronted with as the local urban poor, we were facing challenges due to our refugee status, such as a language barrier.
In Congo, the official language is French.
But in Uganda, it is English.
We didn't have access to education and health.
We were exposed to harassment, exploitation, intimidation and discrimination.
Humanitarian organizations mostly focused on the formal settlement in rural areas, and there was nothing in place for us.
But we didn't want handouts.
We wanted to work and support ourselves.
I joined my other two colleagues in exile and set up an organization to support other refugees.
YARID -- Young African Refugees for Integral Development -- began as a conversation within the Congolese community.
We asked the community how they could organize themselves to solve these challenges.
The YARID programs for support evolve in stages, progressing from soccer community, to English language to sewing livelihoods.
The soccer changed the energy of unemployed youth and connected people from different communities.
The free English classes help empower people to engage with the Ugandan community, allowing them to get to know their neighbors and sell wares.
The vocational training program offers livelihood skills, and with them, important opportunities for economic self-reliance.
We've seen so many families become self-sustaining.
We've seen who no longer needs our help.
As YARID's programs have expanded, it has included an increasing range of nationalities -- Congolese, Rwandan, Burundian, Somalis, Ethiopian, South Sudanese.
Today, YARID has supported over 3,000 refugees across Kampala and continues supporting more.
(Applause)
Refugees want empowerment, not handouts.
We know our community better than anyone.
We understand the challenges and opportunities we face to become self-reliant.
I know better than anyone that initiatives created by refugees work.
They need to be internationally recognized and supported.
Give us the support we deserve, and we will pay you back with interest.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
You know who I'm envious of?
People who work in a job that has to do with their college major.
(Laughter)
Journalists who studied journalism, engineers who studied engineering.
The truth is, these folks are no longer the rule, but the exception.
A 2010 study found that only a quarter of college graduates work in a field that relates to their degree.
I graduated with not one but two degrees in biology.
To my parents' dismay, I am neither a doctor nor a scientist.
(Laughter)
Years of studying DNA replication and photosynthesis did little to prepare me for a career in technology.
I had to teach myself everything from sales, marketing, strategy, even a little programming, on my own.
I had never held the title of Product Manager before I sent my resume in to Etsy.
I had already been turned down by Google and several other firms and was getting frustrated.
The company had recently gone public, so as part of my job application, I read the IPO filings from cover to cover and built a website from scratch which included my analysis of the business and four ideas for new features.
It turned out the team was actively working on two of those ideas and had seriously considered a third.
I got the job.
We all know people who were ignored or overlooked at first but went on to prove their critics wrong. My favorite story? Brian Acton, an engineering manager who was rejected by both Twitter and Facebook before cofounding WhatsApp, the mobile messaging platform that would sell for 19 billion dollars.
The hiring systems we built in the 20th century are failing us and causing us to miss out on people with incredible potential.
The advances in robotics and machine learning and transforming the way we work, automating routine tasks in many occupations while augmenting and amplifying human labor in others.
At this rate, we should all be expecting to do jobs we've never done before for the rest of our careers.
So what are the tools and strategies we need to identify tomorrow's high performers?
In search for answers, I've consulted with leaders across many sectors, read dozens of reports and research papers and conducted some of my own talent experiments.
My quest is far from over, but here are three ideas to take forward.
One: expand your search.
If we only look for talent in the same places we always do -- gifted child programs, Ivy League schools, prestigious organizations -- we're going to get the same results we always have.
Baseball was transformed when the cash-strapped Oakland Athletics started recruiting players who didn't score highly on traditionally valued metrics, like runs batted in, but who had the ability to help the team score points and win games.
This idea is taking hold outside of sports.
The Head of Design and Research at Pinterest told me that they've built one of the most diverse and high-performing teams in Silicon Valley because they believe that no one type of person holds a monopoly on talent.
They've worked hard to look beyond major tech hubs and focus on designers' portfolios, not their pedigrees.
Two: hire for performance.
Inspired by my own job experience, I cofounded a hiring platform called Headlight, which gives candidates an opportunity to shine.
Just as teams have tryouts and plays have auditions, candidates should be asked to demonstrate their skills before they're hired.
Our clients are benefiting from 85 years of employment research, which shows that work samples are one of the best predictors of success on the job.
If you're hiring a data analyst, give them a spreadsheet of historical data and ask them for their key insights.
If you're hiring a marketing manager, have them plan a launch campaign for a new product.
And if you're a candidate, don't wait for an employer to ask.
Seek out ways to showcase your unique skills and abilities outside of just the standard resume and cover letter.
Three: get the bigger picture.
I've heard about recruiters who are quick to label a candidate a job-hopper based on a single short stint on their resume; read about professors who are more likely to ignore identical messages from students because their name was black or Asian instead of white.
I was almost put on a special needs track as a child.
A month into kindergarten, my teacher wrote a page-long memo noting that I was impulsive, had a short attention span, and despite my wonderful curiosity, I was exhausting to work with.
(Laughter)
The principal asked my parents into a meeting, asked my mother if there had been complications at birth and suggested I meet with a school psychologist.
My father saw what was happening and quickly explained our family situation.
As recent immigrants, we lived in the attic of a home that cared for adults with mental disabilities.
My parents worked nights to make ends meet, and I had little opportunity to spend time with kids my own age.
Is it really a surprise that an understimulated five-year-old boy might be a little excited in a kindergarten classroom after an entire summer by himself?
Until we get a holistic view of someone, our judgment of them will always be flawed.
Let's stop equating experience with ability, credentials with competence.
Let's stop settling for the safe, familiar choice and leave the door open for someone who could be amazing.
We need employers to let go of outdated hiring practices and embrace new ways of identifying and cultivating talent, and candidates can help by learning to tell their story in powerful and compelling ways.
We could live in a world where people are seen for what they're truly capable of and have the opportunity to realize their full potential.
So let's go out and build it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
There's an African proverb that goes, "The lion's story will never be known as long as the hunter is the one to tell it."
More than a racial conversation, we need a racial literacy to decode the politics of racial threat in America.
Key to this literacy is a forgotten truth, that the more we understand that our cultural differences represent the power to heal the centuries of racial discrimination, dehumanization and illness.
Both of my parents were African-American.
My father was born in Southern Delaware, my mother, North Philadelphia, and these two places are as different from each other as east is from west, as New York City is from Montgomery, Alabama.
My father's way of dealing with racial conflict was to have my brother Bryan, my sister Christy and I in church what seemed like 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
(Laughter)
If anybody bothered us because of the color of our skin, he believed that you should pray for them, knowing that God would get them back in the end.
(Laughter)
You could say that his racial-coping approach was spiritual -- for later on, one day, like Martin Luther King.
My mother's coping approach was a little different.
She was, uh, you could say, more relational -- right now, like, in your face, right now. More like Malcolm X.
(Laughter)
She was raised from neighborhoods in which there was racial violence and segregation, where she was chased out of neighborhoods, and she exacted violence to chase others out of hers.
When she came to Southern Delaware, she thought she had come to a foreign country.
She didn't understand anybody, particularly the few black and brown folks who were physically deferential and verbally deferential in the presence of whites. Not my mother. When she wanted to go somewhere, she walked.
She didn't care what you thought.
And she pissed a lot of people off with her cultural style.
Before we get into the supermarket, she would give us the talk: "Don't ask for nothin', don't touch nothin'.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
I don't care if all the other children are climbing the walls.
They're not my children.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? "In three-part harmony:" Yes, Mom. "Before we'd get into the supermarket, that talk was all we needed.
Now, how many of you ever got that talk?
How many of you ever give that talk?
(Laughter)
How many of you ever give that talk today?
My mother didn't give us the talk because she was worried about money or reputation or us misbehaving. We never misbehaved. We were too scared.
We were in church 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
(Laughter)
She gave us that talk to remind us that some people in the world would interpret us as misbehaving just by being black.
Not every parent has to worry about their children being misjudged because of the color of their skin, just by breathing.
So we get into the supermarket, and people look at us -- stare at us as if we just stole something.
Every now and then, a salesperson would do something or say something because they were pissed with our cultural style, and it would usually happen at the conveyor belt.
And the worst thing they could do was to throw our food into the bag.
And when that happened, it was on.
(Laughter)
My mother began to tell them who they were, who their family was, where to go, how fast to get there.
(Laughter)
If you haven't been cursed out by my mother, you haven't lived.
(Laughter)
The person would be on the floor, writhing in utter decay and decomposition, whimpering in a pool of racial shame.
(Laughter)
Now, both my parents were Christians.
The difference is my father prayed before a racial conflict and my mother prayed after.
(Laughter)
There is a time, if you use both of their strategies, if you use them in the right time and the right way.
But it's never a time -- there's a time for conciliation, there's a time for confrontation, but it's never a time to freeze up like a deer in the headlights, and it's never a time to lash out in heedless, thoughtless anger.
The lesson in this is that when it comes to race relations, sometimes, we've got to know how to pray, think through, process, prepare.
And other times, we've got to know how to push, how to do something.
And I'm afraid that neither of these two skills -- preparing, pushing -- are prevalent in our society today.
If you look at the neuroscience research which says that when we are racially threatened, our brains go on lockdown, and we dehumanize black and brown people.
Our brains imagine that children and adults are older than they really are, larger than they really are and closer than they really are.
When we're at our worst, we convince ourselves that they don't deserve affection or protection.
At the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, we know that some of the scariest moments are racial encounters, some of the scariest moments that people will ever face.
If you look at the police encounters that have led to some wrongful deaths of mostly Native Americans and African-Americans in this country, they've lasted about two minutes.
our brains go on lockdown, Within 60 seconds,
And when we're unprepared, we overreact.
At best, we shut down.
At worst, we shoot first and ask no questions.
Imagine if we could reduce the intensity of threat within those 60 seconds and keep our brains from going on lockdown.
Imagine how many children would get to come home from school or 7-Eleven without getting expelled or shot.
Imagine how many mothers and fathers wouldn't have to cry.
Racial socialization can help young people negotiate 60-second encounters, but it's going to take more than a chat.
It requires a racial literacy.
Now, how do parents have these conversations, and what is a racial literacy? Thank you for asking.
(Laughter)
A racial literacy involves the ability to read, recast and resolve a racially stressful encounter.
Reading involves recognizing when a racial moment happens and noticing our stress reactions to it.
Recasting involves taking mindfulness and reducing my tsunami interpretation of this moment and reducing it to a mountain-climbing experience, one that is -- from impossible situation to one that is much more doable and challenging.
Resolving a racially stressful encounter involves being able to make a healthy decision that is not an underreaction, where I pretend, "That didn't bother me," or an overreaction, where I exaggerate the moment.
Now, we can teach parents and children how to read, recast and resolve using a mindfulness strategy we call: "Calculate, locate, communicate, breathe and exhale." Stay with me. "Calculate" asks, "What feeling am I having right now, and how intense is it on a scale of one to 10?" "Locate" asks, "Where in my body do I feel it?" And be specific, like the Native American girl at a Chicago fifth-grade school said to me, "I feel angry at a nine because I'm the only Native American.
And I can feel it in my stomach, like a bunch of butterflies are fighting with each other, so much so that they fly up into my throat and choke me. "The more detailed you can be, the easier it is to reduce that spot." Communicate "asks," What self-talk and what images are coming in my mind? "And if you really want help, try breathing in and exhaling slowly.
With the help of my many colleagues at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative, we use in-the-moment stress-reduction in several research and therapy projects.
One project is where we use basketball to help youth manage their emotions during 60-second eruptions on the court.
Another project, with the help of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott, we leverage the cultural style of African-American barbershops, where we train black barbers to be health educators in two areas: one, to safely reduce the sexual risk in their partner relationships; and the other, to stop retaliation violence.
The cool part is the barbers use their cultural style to deliver this health education to 18- to 24-year-old men while they're cutting their hair.
Another project is where we teach teachers how to read, recast and resolve stressful moments in the classroom.
And a final project, in which we teach parents and their children separately to understand their racial traumas before we bring them together to problem-solve daily microaggressions.
Now, racially literate conversations with our children can be healing, but it takes practice.
And I know some of you are saying, "Practice? Practice? We're talking about practice?" Yes, we are talking about practice.
I have two sons. My oldest, Bryan, is 26, and my youngest, Julian, is 12.
And we do not have time to talk about how that happened.
(Laughter)
But, when I think of them, they are still babies to me, and I worry every day that the world will misjudge them.
In August of 2013, Julian, who was eight at the time, and I were folding laundry, which in and of itself is such a rare occurrence, I should have known something strange was going to happen.
On the TV were Trayvon Martin's parents, and they were crying because of the acquittal of George Zimmerman.
And Julian was glued to the TV.
He had a thousand questions, and I was not prepared.
He wanted to know why: Why would a grown man stalk and hunt down and kill an unarmed 17-year-old boy?
And I did not know what to say.
The best thing that could come out of my mouth was, "Julian, sometimes in this world, there are people who look down on black and brown people and do not treat them -- and children, too -- do not treat them as human." He interpreted the whole situation as sad.
(Voice-over) Julian Stevenson: That's sad. "We don't care.
You're not our kind. "
HS: Yes.
JS: It's like, "We're better than you."
JS: "And there's nothing you can do about that.
And if you scare me, or something like that, I will shoot you because I'm scared of you."
HS: Exactly. But if somebody's stalking you --
JS: It's not the same for everyone else.
HS: It's not always the same, no.
JS: Yeah, because people can disrespect you.
HS: Exactly.
JS: And think that you're, "You don't look -- you don't look like you're ..." It's like they're saying that "You don't look right, so I guess I have the right to disrespect you."
HS: Yeah, and that's what we call, we call that racism.
And we call that racism, Julian, and yes, some people — other people — can wear a hoodie, and nothing happens to them.
But you and Trayvon might, and that's why Daddy wants you to be safe.
(Voice-over) HS: And that's why --
JS: So you mean like, when you said "other people," you mean, like if Trayvon was a white, um, that he wouldn't be disrespected like that?
HS: Yes, Julian, Daddy meant white people when I said, "other people," all right?
So there was a way in which I was so awkward in the beginning, but once I started getting my rhythm and my groove, I started talking about stereotypes and issues of discrimination, and just when I was getting my groove on, Julian interrupted me.
(Voice-over) HS: ... dangerous, or you're a criminal because you're black, and you're a child or a boy -- That is wrong, it doesn't matter who does it.
JS: Dad, I need to stop you there.
HS: What?
JS: Remember when we were ...
HS: So he interrupts me to tell me a story about when he was racially threatened at a swimming pool with a friend by two grown white men, which his mother confirmed.
And I felt happy that he was able to talk about it; it felt like he was getting it.
We moved from the sadness of Trayvon's parents and started talking about George Zimmerman's parents, which, I read in a magazine, condoned the stalking of Trayvon.
And Julian's reaction to me was priceless.
It made me feel like he was getting it.
(Voice-over) JS: What did they say about him?
HS: Well, I think they basically felt that he was justified to follow and stalk --
JS: What the -- ?
HS: Yeah, I think that's wrong.
JS: That's -- one minute.
So they're saying he has the right to follow a black kid, get in a fight with him and shoot him?
HS: As Julian was getting it, I started to lose it.
Because in my mind's eye, I was thinking: What if my Julian or Bryan was Trayvon? I calculated my anger at a 10.
I found, located, my right leg was shaking uncontrollably like I was running.
And in my mind's eye, I could see somebody chasing Julian, and I was chasing them.
And the only thing that could come out of my mouth was if anybody tries to bother my child ...
(Voice-over) HS: If anybody tries to bother my child ... mmm, mmm, mmm.
JS: What will happen?
HS: Well, they better run.
JS: Because what? HS: I'm gonna get 'em.
JS: See? (Laughs)
HS: Oh, yeah.
JS: Then they're gonna get you because they might have weapons.
HS: Well, you know what, I'm gonna call police, too, like I should.
But I feel like I wanna get 'em.
But you can't; you're right, you can't just go chasing people.
JS: They can be armed.
HS: Yeah, you right. Yeah, you right.
I feel like I wanna chase 'em.
JS: Plus they could be an army or something.
HS: I know -- I feel like I wanna go get 'em, messing with my son.
I don't like that.
JS: Um ...
HS: But you right.
You gotta be careful.
And um, you gotta be careful.
You never know what some crazy people will think about you.
Just as long as you believe you're beautiful like Daddy believes you're beautiful and handsome, and Mommy believes you're beautiful and handsome and smart.
And you deserve to be on this planet, just as happy and beautiful and smart as you want to be.
You can do anything you want, baby.
HS: Racial socialization is not just what parents teach their children.
It's also how children respond to what their parents teach.
Is my child prepared?
Can they recognize when a racial elephant shows up in a room?
Can they reduce their tsunami interpretation down to a mountain-climbing adventure that they can engage and not run away?
Can they make a healthy and just decision in 60 seconds? Can I? Can you?
Yes, we can. We can build healthier relationships around race if we learn to calculate, locate communicate, breathe and exhale in the middle of our most threatening moments, when we come face-to-face with our lesser selves.
If you take the centuries of racial rage that boils up in all of our bodies, minds and souls -- and anything that affects our bodies, minds and souls affects our health -- we could probably use gun control for our hearts.
I just want what all parents want for their children when we're not around: affection and protection.
When police and teachers see my children, I want them to imagine their own, because I believe if you see our children as your children, you won't shoot them.
With racial literacy, and yes, practice, we can decode the racial trauma from our stories, and our healing will come in the telling.
But we must never forget that our cultural differences are full of affection and protection, and remember always that the lion's story will never be known as long as the hunter is the one to tell it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I was around 10 when one day, I discovered a box of my father's old things. In it, under a bunch of his college textbooks, was a pair of black corduroy bell-bottom pants.
These pants were awful -- musty and moth-eaten.
And of course, I fell in love with them.
I'd never seen anything like them.
Until that day, all I'd ever known and worn was my school uniform, which, in fact, I was pretty grateful for, because from quite a young age, I'd realized I was somewhat different.
I'd never been one of the boys my age; terrible at sports, possibly the unmanliest little boy ever.
(Laughter)
I was bullied quite a bit.
And so, I figured that to survive I would be invisible, and the uniform helped me to seem no different from any other child.
(Laughter)
Well, almost. This became my daily prayer: "God, please make me just like everybody else." I think this went straight to God's voicemail, though.
(Laughter)
And eventually, it became pretty clear that I was not growing up to be the son that my father always wanted. Sorry, Dad.
No, I was not going to magically change.
And over time, I grew less and less sure that I actually wanted to.
Therefore, the day those black corduroy bell-bottom pants came into my life, something happened.
I didn't see pants; I saw opportunity.
The very next day, I had to wear them to school, come what may.
And once I pulled on those god-awful pants and belted them tight, almost instantly, I developed what can only be called a swagger.
(Laughter)
(Laughter) All the way to school, and then all the way back because I was sent home at once --
I finally didn't care anymore that I could not conform. That day, I was suddenly celebrating it.
That day, instead of being invisible, I chose to be looked at, just by wearing something different.
That day, I discovered the power of what we wear.
That day, I discovered the power of fashion, and I've been in love with it ever since.
Fashion can communicate our differences to the world for us.
And with this simple act of truth, I realized that these differences -- they stopped being our shame.
They became our expressions, expressions of our very unique identities.
And we should express ourselves, wear what we want.
What's the worst that could happen?
The fashion police are going to get you for being so last season?
(Laughter)
Yeah. Well, unless the fashion police meant something entirely different.
Nobel Prize laureate Malala survived Taliban extremists in October 2012.
However, in October 2017, she faced a different enemy, when online trolls viciously attacked the photograph that showed the 20-year-old wearing jeans that day.
The comments, the hatred she received, ranged from "How long before the scarf comes off?" to, and I quote, "That's the reason the bullet directly targeted her head a long time ago." Now, when most of us decide to wear a pair of jeans someplace like New York, London, Milan, Paris, we possibly don't stop to think that it's a privilege; something that somewhere else can have consequences, something that can one day be taken away from us.
My grandmother was a woman who took extraordinary pleasure in dressing up.
Her fashion was colorful.
And the color she loved to wear so much was possibly the only thing that was truly about her, the one thing she had agency over, because like most other women of her generation in India, she'd never been allowed to exist beyond what was dictated by custom and tradition.
She'd been married at 17, and after 65 years of marriage, when my grandfather died suddenly one day, her loss was unbearable.
But that day, she was going to lose something else as well, the one joy she had: to wear color.
In India, according to custom, when a Hindu woman becomes a widow, all she's allowed to wear is white from the day of the death of her husband.
No one made my grandmother wear white.
However, every woman she'd known who had outlived her husband, including her mother, had done it.
This oppression was so internalized, so deep-rooted, that she herself refused a choice.
She passed away this year, and until the day she died, she continued to wear only white.
I have a photograph with her from earlier, happier times.
In it, you can't really see what she's wearing -- the photo is in black and white.
However, from the way she's smiling in it, you just know she's wearing color.
This is also what fashion can do.
It has the power to fill us with joy, the joy of freedom to choose for ourselves how we want to look, how we want to live -- a freedom worth fighting for.
And fighting for freedom, protest, comes in many forms.
Widows in India like my grandmother, thousands of them, live in a city called Vrindavan.
And so, it's been a sea of white for centuries.
However, only as recently as 2013, the widows of Vrindavan have started to celebrate Holi, the Indian festival of color, which they are prohibited from participating in.
On this one day in March, these women take the traditional colored powder of the festival and color each other.
With every handful of the powder they throw into the air, their white saris slowly start to suffuse with color. And they don't stop until they're completely covered in every hue of the rainbow that's forbidden to them.
The color washes off the next day, however, for that moment in time, it's their beautiful disruption.
This disruption, any kind of dissonance, can be the first gauntlet we throw down in a battle against oppression.
And fashion -- it can create visual disruption for us -- on us, literally.
Lessons of defiance have always been taught by fashion's great revolutionaries: its designers.
Jean Paul Gaultier taught us that women can be kings.
Thom Browne -- he taught us that men can wear heels.
And Alexander McQueen, in his spring 1999 show, had two giant robotic arms in the middle of his runway.
And as the model, Shalom Harlow began to spin in between them, these two giant arms -- furtively at first and then furiously, began to spray color onto her.
McQueen, thus, before he took his own life, taught us that this body of ours is a canvas, a canvas we get to paint however we want.
Somebody who loved this world of fashion was Karar Nushi.
He was a student and actor from Iraq.
He loved his vibrant, eclectic clothes.
However, he soon started receiving death threats for how he looked. He remained unfazed. He remained fabulous, until July 2017, when Karar was discovered dead on a busy street in Baghdad.
He'd been kidnapped.
He'd been tortured.
And eyewitnesses say that his body showed multiple wounds. Stab wounds.
Two thousand miles away in Peshawar, Pakistani transgender activist Alisha was shot multiple times in May 2016.
She was taken to the hospital, but because she dressed in women's clothing, she was refused access to either the men's or the women's wards.
What we choose to wear can sometimes be literally life and death.
And even in death, we sometimes don't get to choose.
Alisha died that day and then was buried as a man.
What kind of world is this?
Well, it's one in which it's natural to be afraid, to be frightened of this surveillance, this violence against our bodies and what we wear on them.
However, the greater fear is that once we surrender, blend in and begin to disappear one after the other, the more normal this false conformity will look, the less shocking this oppression will feel.
For the children we are raising, the injustice of today could become the ordinary of tomorrow.
They'll get used to this, and they, too, might begin to see anything different as dirty, something to be hated, something to be extinguished, like lights to be put out, one by one, until darkness becomes a way of life.
However, if I today, then you tomorrow, maybe even more of us someday, if we embrace our right to look like ourselves, then in the world that's been violently whitewashed, we will become the pinpricks of color pushing through, much like those widows of Vrindavan.
How then, with so many of us, will the crosshairs of a gun be able to pick out Karar, Malala, Alisha?
Can they kill us all?
The time is now to stand up, to stand out.
Where sameness is safeness, with something as simple as what we wear, we can draw every eye to ourselves to say that there are differences in this world, and there always will be.
Get used to it.
And this we can say without a single word.
Fashion can give us a language for dissent.
It can give us courage.
Fashion can let us literally wear our courage on our sleeves. So wear it. Wear it like armor.
Wear it because it matters.
And wear it because you matter.
Thank you.
(Applause)
A room full of boys.
A girl child, hardly nine or ten years old, she is sitting in the center of the room, surrounded by books.
She is the only girl among boys, and is barely missing her female cousins and friends, who are inside the home instead of the school, because they are not allowed to get an education alongside boys.
There isn't a single functional girls' school in her village.
She was born in a Baloch conservative tribe, where women and girls are a matter of honor.
She is the eldest in her family, and when she was about to be born, her parents wanted a baby boy.
But they had bad luck; a baby girl arrived.
It was customary in her family to keep girls inside the homes.
But her uncle, who was a university graduate, he wanted to give her an opportunity to see the world, to be part of the society.
Luckily, she has a name that can be used for both men and women.
So he saw a chance to change her course of life.
So he decided to raise her as a boy.
At three months old, she went from being a baby girl, to baby boy.
She is given a boy's getup.
She is allowed to go outside and get an education alongside boys.
She is free, she is confident.
She observes, she notes small, everyday injustices faced by women and girls in her village.
When newspapers arrive at her home, she watches as it passes from the eldest man to the youngest man.
By the time women get hold of the paper, it is old news.
She completes her eighth-grade year. Now fear starts to come in.
This will be the end of her education, because the only option for high school for further study is five kilometers away.
Boys have bicycles, they are free.
But she knows her father will not allow her to travel on her own, even if she were posing as a boy. "I can't let you do that.
And I don't have the time to walk you there and back.
Sorry, it is impossible." She gets very upset.
But a miracle happened.
A long-distance relative offers to teach her ninth- and tenth-grade curricula during summer vacations.
This is how she completed her matriculation.
The girl whom I am talking about to you is me, Shameem, who is talking before you now.
(Applause)
Throughout centuries, people have been fighting for their identity.
People have been loved, privileged, because of their identity, their nationality, their ethnicity.
Again, people have been hated, denied, because of their nationality, their identity, their race, their gender, their religion.
Identity determines your position in society, wherever you live.
So if you ask me, I would say I hate this question of identity.
Millions of girls in this world are being denied their basic rights because of being female.
I would have faced the same, if I hadn't been raised as a boy.
I was determined to continue my studies, to learn, to be free.
After my schooling, even enrolling in college was not easy for me.
I went on a three-day hunger strike.
(Laughter)
Then, I got permission for college.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
In that way, I completed my college.
Two years later, when the time came for me to go to university, my father turned his eyes, his attention, to my younger brothers.
They need to be in school, secure jobs and support the family.
And as a woman, my place was to be home.
But, I don't give up.
I sign up for a two-year program to become a lady health visitor.
Then I hear about Thardeep Rural Development Program, a non-profit organization working to empower rural communities. I sneak away. I travel five hours to interview for a position.
It is the first time I am the farthest from my home I have ever been.
I am closest to my freedom I have ever been.
Luckily, I got the job, but the hardest part is facing my father.
(Laughter)
Relatives are already scaring him about his daughter wandering off, teasing him with talk of his daughter crossing the border.
When I return home, I want nothing more than just to accept the position in Thardeep.
So that night, I packed all my things in a bag, and I walked into my father's room and told him, "Tomorrow morning, the bus is going to come in.
If you believe in me, if you believe in me, you will wake me up and take me to the bus station.
If you don't, I'll understand." Then I went to sleep.
The next morning, my father was standing beside me to take me to the bus stop.
(Applause)
That day, I understood the importance of words.
I understood how words affect our hearts, how words play an important role in our lives.
I understood words are more powerful than fighting.
At TRDP, I saw there was a Pakistan which I didn't know, a country much more complex than I had realized.
Until that, I thought I had a difficult life.
But here, I saw what women in other parts of Pakistan were experiencing.
It really opened my eyes.
Some women had 11 children but nothing to feed them.
For getting water, they would walk three hours every day to wells.
The nearest hospital was at least 32 kilometers away.
So if a woman is in labor, she travels by camel to get to the hospital.
The distance is great; she may die on her way.
So now, this became more than just a job for me.
I discovered my power.
Now, as I was getting salary, I started sending back money to my home.
Relatives and neighbors were noticing this.
Now they started to understand the importance of education.
By that time, some other parents started sending their daughters to school.
Slowly, it became easier and acceptable for young women to be in college.
Today, there isn't a single girl out of school in my village.
(Applause)
Girls are doing jobs in health sites, even in police. Life was good. But somewhere in my heart, I realized that my region, beyond my village needs further change.
This was also the time when I joined Acumen Fellowship.
There, I met leaders like me across the country.
And I saw they are taking risks in their lives.
I started to understand what leadership really means.
So I decided to go back to my region and take a position as a teacher in a remote school, a school that I have to reach by bus -- two hours traveling, every morning and evening.
Though it was hard, on my first day I knew I made the right decision.
The first day I walked into the school, I saw all these little Shameems staring back at me --
(Laughter)
with dreams in their eyes, the same dream of freedom which I had in my childhood.
So the girls are eager to learn, but the school is understaffed.
Girls sit hopeful, learn nothing, and they leave.
I can't bear to see this happening.
There was no turning back.
I found my purpose.
I enlisted a few of my friends to help me to teach.
I'm introducing my girls to the outside world by extracurricular activities and books.
I share with them the profiles of the world's best leaders, like Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela.
Last year, a few of our students went to college.
For me, I never stop studying.
Today, I'm working to complete my PhD in education --
(Applause)
which will allow me to gain a management position in the school system, and I will be able to make more decisions and play a pivotal role in the system.
I believe that without educating the girls, we may not make world peace.
We may not reduce child marriage.
We may not reduce infant mortality rate.
We may not reduce maternal mortality rate.
For this, we have to continuously and collectively work together.
At least I am playing my role, though the destination is not close.
The road is not easy.
But I have dreams in my eyes, and I am not going to look back now.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One winter morning, a couple of years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a haze hanging over the city.
I make that drive on most days, so it was unusual that I hadn't noticed this before.
Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, which I could barely see that morning.
It didn't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud of air pollution.
The contrast between the scenic environment I knew and this smog-covered skyline stirred up something within me.
I was appalled by the possibility of this city of bright and vivid sunsets being overrun by a dull haze.
At that moment, I felt an urge to do something about it, but I didn't know what.
All I knew was I couldn't just stand idly by.
The main challenge was, I didn't know much about environmental science air-quality management or atmospheric chemistry.
I am a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't code my way out of this air pollution problem.
(Laughter)
Who was I to do anything about this issue?
I was but a citizen.
In the following years, I learned a very important lesson, a lesson we all need to take to heart if we are to work towards a better future.
Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain, your outside expertise may hold the key to solving big problems within that domain.
Sometimes the unique perspective you have can result in unconventional thinking that can move the needle, but you need to be bold enough to try.
That's the only way you'll ever know.
What I knew back then was that if I was even going to try to make a difference, I had to get smart about air pollution first, and so I became a student again.
I did a bit of basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk.
Data from the World Health Organization shows that almost 14 percent of all deaths worldwide in 2012 were attributable to household and ambient air pollution, with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria and HIV / AIDS.
In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation or childhood malnutrition pale in comparison to deaths due to air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Now, in my work, I explore new frontiers for artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine can find a beneficial footing and help us to make better decisions.
As I thought about the air pollution problem, it became clear that we needed to find a way to make better decisions about how we manage air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it was necessary to do it in a collaborative way.
So I decided I'd better get to know some people working within the field.
I started to speak to officials from the City of Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I engaged the local scientific community, and I also made a few cold calls.
The process of engagement I embarked upon helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the problem.
It also helped me to avoid the trap people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate, where we are quick to apply a technology before we've firmly grasped the problem at hand.
I began to develop an idea about what I could do to improve the situation.
I started by simply asking myself how I could bring together in some meaningful way my skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the expertise of the people I'd reached out to.
I wanted to create an online air-quality management platform that would uncover trends in pollution and project into the future to determine what outcomes can be expected.
I was determined to see my idea translate into a practical solution, but I faced uncertainty and had no guarantee of success.
What I had was a very particular set of engineering skills, skills I'd acquired over my career
(Laughter)
that were new to people who had been working on the air pollution problem for so many years.
What I have come to realize is that sometimes just one fresh perspective, one new skill set, can make the conditions right for something remarkable to happen.
Our willpower and imagination are a guiding light, enabling us to chart new paths and navigate through obstacles.
Armed with a firmer understanding of the air pollution problem, and having managed to source over a decade's worth of data on air pollutant levels and the meteorological conditions for in and around Johannesburg, my colleagues from South Africa and China and myself created an air-quality decision support system that lives in the cloud.
This software system analyzes historical and real-time data to uncover the spatial-temporal trends in pollution.
We then used new machine learning technology to predict future levels of pollution for several different pollutants days in advance.
This means that citizens can make better decisions about their daily movements and about where to settle their families.
We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time, identify heavy polluters, and they can be ordered by the relevant authorities to scale back their operations.
Through assisted scenario planning, city planners can also make better decisions about how to extend infrastructure, such as human settlements or industrial zones.
We completed a pilot of our technology that was run over a period of 120 days, covering all of South Africa.
Our results were confirmed when we demonstrated a tight correlation between the forecasting data and the data we were getting on the ground.
Through our leadership, we have brought cutting-edge, world-leading assets that can perform air-quality forecasting at an unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city that I drove into one winter morning not very long ago, and thought to myself, "Something is wrong here.
I wonder what can be done? "
So here is the point: What if I'd not investigated the problem of air pollution further?
What if I'd not shown some concern for the state of the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was taking care of the matter?
What I have learned is that, when embarking on a challenging endeavor that advances a cause that we firmly believe in, it is important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequence of not acting.
We should not get distracted by resistance and opposition, but this should motivate us further.
So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find that there's some natural curiosity you have that is being piqued, and it's about something you care about, and you have some crazy or bold ideas, and perhaps it's outside the realm of your expertise, ask yourself this: Why not?
Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can, in your own way?
You may be pleasantly surprised.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In 1996, I was commissioned by the Guggenheim Museum to execute a large body of work called "Uses of Evidence." It was a cube -- a very well large cube, at that.
Each side had a window in order for the spectators to view the interior of the structure.
The exterior of the structure was a collage of Africa and Africans as portrayed in the Western media and literature.
A look through the windows revealed a sharp contrast: within the cubes are tranquil, civilized, domestic images of African family members, friends and Nigerian professionals, ranging from writers, poets, fashion designers, etc. The thing is, both the exterior and the interior images are quite true.
But the images captured by Western media overwhelmingly depict Africans as basically primitive at best, or barely distinguishable from the African animals.
Not much has changed, I'm afraid, since 1996, when I executed this work.
I began my professional photography practice in 1994, but my passion and enthusiasm for photography goes back to childhood, when my parents arranged for us to be photographed by a professional photographer on almost a monthly basis.
It was also an opportunity for my siblings to dress up in our latest gear, made by our tailor.
Later, when I was in boarding school, my friends and I bought Polaroid cameras, and then I began to experiment with self-portraiture, or what I would call "proto-selfie auto-portraits."
(Laughter) "Cover Girl 1994" was my first major work that was critically well received in the US and Europe and quite instantly became a part of the school anthologies at universities and colleges.
With the "Cover Girl" series, I wanted to reimagine the magazine cover with imagery totally unexpected, yet profoundly reasonable.
The "Cover Girl" series proposed a different way the African can be represented in a more complex manner.
Like "Cover Girl," the "Sartorial Anarchy" series is made up of self-portraits.
It is an ongoing body of work, started in 2010.
In each image, I married disparate costumes from widely diverse traditions, countries and time frames.
And in mixing eras, cultures, I was able to bring harmony, as it were, to their similarly irreconcilable differences.
These differences became a source of inspired artistic celebration.
For example, in "Sartorial Anarchy #4," I mixed a boater hat, inspired by the traditional Eton-Oxford College Boat Race, with a green Afghan traditional coat and an American Boy Scout shirt -- a culture clash that works.
In "Sartorial Anarchy #5," I wore a macaroni wig, inspired by eighteenth-century macaroni headgear from England.
This was paired with a British Norfolk jacket, Yoruba Nigerian trousers, and, improbably, a South African Zulu fighting stick.
All harmoniously coexist on one body.
And with "Sartorial Anarchy," I began to invest more into the organization of my pictures.
I also began to investigate the vast possibilities of color: its emotional values, psychological impulse, poetic allure and a boundless capacity beyond the realm of meaning and logic.
Now, enter Nollywood. In October of 2014, I returned to Lagos, Nigeria, after over three decades away and took photographs of 64 Nollywood personalities.
I captured a cross section of the industry, as well as the next generation of rising stars.
Nollywood is the first time that you have a school of African filmmakers truly, truly, profoundly in charge of telling African stories.
In their varied movies -- from romantic movies, horror films, gangster movies to action movies -- one sees Nigerians portrayed with many layers of complexities.
All the Nigerian, or "Naija," archetypes, if you allow, are there -- from the divvers, the "Shakara," the coquette, the gangsters, the rich, the corrupt politicians, the whore, the pimp -- all in their swagger.
And of course, you have the lowlifes and the losers, too, all vividly portrayed.
Nollywood is Africa's mirror par excellence.
Typically, I direct all of my portraits, from the way my subject conducts his or her head, the way the neck is tilted, the expression of the fingers, the gestures of the hands, to the gaze and overall bearing and countenance.
Let me describe some of the photographs for you. Genevieve Nnaji. She is the reigning queen of Nollywood.
Here, I was quoting from the grand, Pharaonic African cultures of the Nile Valley civilizations; namely, Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, so as to imbue her with a stately, ironic, calm grandeur.
Taiwo Ajai-Lycett is the grande dame of Nollywood.
Every aspect of her being commands attention.
So I posed her with her back to the audience.
Her face turned to meet us with a redoubtable gaze.
She doesn't need to seek our approval.
She's all that. Sadiq Daba. There was an unspoken authoritarian and imperial bearing that Sadiq Daba exudes upon meeting him.
In this portrait, he simply sat and allowed his massive, massive Nigerian caftan to signal his status. Quite an accomplishment. Belinda Effah. Belinda Effah's portrait allowed me to indulge my passion for color, dressed in a long, fitted blue dress that emphasizes her curves, seated on an upholstered green velvet bench.
I gamely employed the multicolored carpet and a vibrant color, in order to evoke the splendor of the multicolored painted bunting bird.
Everything was designed to harmonize the figure of Belinda within the frame.
Monalisa Chinda is, shall we say, the epitome of the luxe existence and lifestyle.
Her picture, or portrait, pretty much speaks for itself.
Alexx Ekubo is a sharp study in simplified elegance and dignity and a harmony in blue and white, as well.
Enyinna Nwigwe is a Nollywood matinee idol.
There is whiff of the rake about him, and that gives him an enchanting edge.
That's what I felt when I designed and organized the portrait.
Now, Nollywood is a new phase of Africa.
It is modern, post-modern, meta-modern, bold sexy, shrewd and with a contagious attitude worth catching.
As the finale of the project, I assembled the Nollywood stars into a group grand portrait of 64 subjects, called "The School of Nollywood," which was inspired by Rafael's "School of Athens," that was done circa 1509.
It is at the Vatican.
This grand group portrait is the exact same size as Rafael's "School of Athens." It measures roughly 27 feet in width by six and a half feet in height.
Nollywood also exemplifies a type of modernity never before seen in Africa.
Think of it: there has never been anything so ubiquitous with such iconic optics to come out of Africa since the Nile Valley civilizations of Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia.
Outside of Nollywood, the image of Africa remains frozen in the old "National Geographic" mode and safari perspective.
But as Africans continue to step and see themselves portrayed by Nollywood in their varied and fantastic complexities, they will, in turn, propagate and perpetuate the positive image of themselves.
This is what Hollywood did and continues to do for the West.
As shocking as this may be, it is almost a taboo in the art world to show Africans in a modern framework -- that is to say, as polished, dry-cleaned, manicured, pedicured and coiffed.
(Applause) Part of my job is to keep beautifying Africa for the world, one portrait at a time.
(Applause) Thank you.
There's a question I've been puzzling over and writing about for pretty much all of my adult life.
Why do some large-scale crises jolt us awake and inspire us to change and evolve while others might jolt us a bit, but then it's back to sleep?
Now, the kind of shocks I'm talking about are big -- a cataclysmic market crash, rising fascism, an industrial accident that poisons on a massive scale.
Now, events like this can act like a collective alarm bell.
Suddenly, we see a threat, we get organized.
We discover strength and resolve that was previously unimaginable.
It's as if we're no longer walking, but leaping.
Except, our collective alarm seems to be busted.
Faced with a crisis, we often fall apart, regress and that becomes a window for antidemocratic forces to push societies backwards, to become more unequal and more unstable.
Ten years ago, I wrote about this backwards process and I called it the "Shock Doctrine." So what determines which road we navigate through crisis?
Whether we grow up fast and find those strengths or whether we get knocked back.
And I'd say this is a pressing question these days.
Because things are pretty shocking out there.
Record-breaking storms, drowning cities, record-breaking fires threatening to devour them, thousands of migrants disappearing beneath the waves.
And openly supremacist movements rising, in many of our countries there are torches in the streets.
And now there's no shortage of people who are sounding the alarm.
But as a society, I don't think we can honestly say that we're responding with anything like the urgency that these overlapping crises demand from us.
And yet, we know from history that it is possible for crisis to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap.
And one of the most striking examples of this progressive power of crisis is the Great Crash of 1929.
There was the shock of the sudden market collapse followed by all of the aftershocks, the millions who lost everything thrown onto breadlines.
And this was taken by many as a message that the system itself was broken.
And many people listened and they leapt into action.
In the United States and elsewhere, governments began to weave a safety net so that the next time there was a crash there would be programs like social security to catch people.
There were huge job-creating public investments in housing, electrification and transit.
And there was a wave of aggressive regulation to reign in the banks.
Now, these reforms were far from perfect.
In the US, African American workers, immigrants and women were largely excluded.
But the Depression period, along with the transformation of allied nations and economies during the World War II effort, show us that it is possible for complex societies to rapidly transform themselves in the face of a collective threat.
Now, when we tell this story of the 1929 Crash, that's usually the formula that it follows -- that there was a shock and it induced a wake-up call and that produced a leap to a safer place.
Now, if that's really what it took, then why isn't it working anymore?
Why do today's non-stop shocks -- why don't they spur us into action?
Why don't they produce leaps?
Especially when it comes to climate change.
So I want to talk to you today about what I think is a much more complete recipe for deep transformation catalyzed by shocking events.
And I'm going to focus on two key ingredients that usually get left out of the history books.
One has to do with imagination, the other with organization.
Because it's in the interplay between the two where revolutionary power lies.
So let's start with imagination.
The victories of the New Deal didn't happen just because suddenly everybody understood the brutalities of laissez-faire.
This was a time, let's remember, of tremendous ideological ferment, when many different ideas about how to organize societies did battle with one another in the public square.
A time when humanity dared to dream big about different kinds of futures, many of them organized along radically egalitarian lines.
Now, not all of these ideas were good but this was an era of explosive imagining.
This meant that the movements demanding change knew what they were against -- crushing poverty, widening inequality -- but just as important, they knew what they were for.
They had their "no" and they had their "yes," too.
They also had very different models of political organization than we do today.
For decades, social and labor movements had been building up their membership bases, linking their causes together and increasing their strength.
Which meant that by the time the Crash happened, there was already a movement that was large and broad enough to, for instance, stage strikes that didn't just shut down factories, but shut down entire cities.
The big policy wins of the New Deal were actually offered as compromises.
Because the alternative seemed to be revolution.
So, let's adjust that equation from earlier.
A shocking event plus utopian imagination plus movement muscle, that's how we get a real leap.
So how does our present moment measure up?
We are living, once again, at a time of extraordinary political engagements.
Politics is a mass obsession.
Progressive movements are growing and resisting with tremendous courage.
And yet, we know from history that "no" is not enough.
Now, there are some "yeses" out there that are emerging.
And they're actually getting a lot bolder quickly.
Where climate activists used to talk about changing light bulbs, now we're pushing for 100 percent of our energy to come from the sun, wind and waves, and to do it fast.
Movements catalyzed by police violence against black bodies are calling for an end to militarized police, mass incarceration and even for reparations for slavery.
Students are not just opposing tuition increases, but from Chile to Canada to the UK, they are calling for free tuition and debt cancellation.
And yet, this still doesn't add up to the kind of holistic and universalist vision of a different world than our predecessors had. So why is that?
Well, very often we think about political change in defined compartments these days.
Environment in one box, inequality in another, racial and gender justice in a couple of other boxes, education over here, health over there.
And within each compartment, there are thousands upon thousands of different groups and NGOs, each competing with one another for credit, name recognition and of course, resources.
In other words, we act a lot like corporate brands.
Now, this is often referred to as the problem of silos.
Now, silos are understandable.
They carve up our complex world into manageable chunks.
They help us feel less overwhelmed.
But in the process, they also train our brains to tune out when somebody else's issue comes up and when somebody else's issue needs our help and support.
And they also keep us from seeing glaring connections between our issues.
So for instance, the people fighting poverty and inequality rarely talk about climate change.
Even though we see time and again that it's the poorest of people who are the most vulnerable to extreme weather.
The climate change people rarely talk about war and occupation.
Even though we know that the thirst for fossil fuels has been a major driver of conflict.
The environmental movement has gotten better at pointing out that the nations that are getting hit hardest by climate change are populated overwhelmingly by black and brown people.
But when black lives are treated as disposable in prisons, in schools and on the streets, these connections are too rarely made.
The walls between our silos also means that our solutions, when they emerge, are also disconnected from each other.
So progressives now have this long list of demands that I was mentioning earlier, those "yeses." But what we're still missing is that coherent picture of the world we're fighting for.
What it looks like, what it feels like, and most of all, what its core values are.
And that really matters. Because when large-scale crises hit us and we are confronted with the need to leap somewhere safer, there isn't any agreement on what that place is.
And leaping without a destination looks a lot like jumping up and down.
(Laughter)
Fortunately, there are all kinds of conversations and experiments going on to try to overcome these divisions that are holding us back.
And I want to finish by talking about one of them.
A couple of years ago, a group of us in Canada decided that we were hitting the limits of what we could accomplish in our various silos.
So we locked ourselves in a room for two days, and we tried to figure out what bound us together.
In that room were people who rarely get face to face.
There were indigenous elders with hipsters working on transit.
There was the head of Greenpeace with a union leader representing oil workers and loggers.
There were faith leaders and feminist icons and many more.
And we gave ourselves a pretty ambitious assignment: agreeing on a short statement describing the world after we win.
The world after we've already made the transition to a clean economy and a much fairer society.
In other words, instead of trying to scare people about what will happen if we don't act, we decided to try to inspire them with what could happen if we did act.
Sensible people are always telling us that change needs to come in small increments.
That politics is the art of the possible and that we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
Well, we rejected all of that.
We wrote a manifesto, and we called it "The Leap." I have to tell you that agreeing on our common "yes" across such diversity of experiences and against a backdrop of a lot of painful history was not easy work.
But it was also pretty thrilling.
Because as soon as we gave ourselves permission to dream, those threads connecting much of our work became self-evident.
We realized, for instance, that the bottomless quest for profits that is forcing so many people to work more than 50 hours a week, without security, and that is fueling this epidemic of despair is the same quest for bottomless profits and endless growth that is at the heart of our ecological crisis and is destabilizing our planet.
It also became clear what we need to do.
We need to create a culture of care-taking.
In which no one and nowhere is thrown away.
In which the inherent value of all people and every ecosystem is foundational.
So we came up with this people's platform, and don't worry, I'm not going to read the whole thing to you out loud -- if you're interested, you can read it at theleap.org. But I will give you a taste of what we came up with.
So we call for that 100 percent renewable economy in a hurry, but we went further.
Calls for new kinds of trade deals, a robust debate on a guaranteed annual income, full rights for immigrant workers, getting corporate money out of politics, free universal day care, electoral reform and more.
What we discovered is that a great many of us are looking for permission to act less like brands and more like movements.
Because movements don't care about credit.
They want good ideas to spread far and wide.
What I love about The Leap is that it rejects the idea that there is this hierarchy of crisis, and it doesn't ask anyone to prioritize one struggle over another or wait their turn.
And though it was birthed in Canada, we've discovered that it travels well.
Since we launched, The Leap has been picked up around the world with similar platforms, being written from Nunavut to Australia, to Norway to the UK and the US, where it's gaining a lot of traction in cities like Los Angeles, where it's being localized.
And also in rural communities that are traditionally very conservative, but where politics is failing the vast majority of people.
Here's what I've learned from studying shocks and disasters for two decades. Crises test us. We either fall apart or we grow up fast.
Finding new reserves of strength and capacity that we never knew we had.
The shocking events that fill us with dread today can transform us, and they can transform the world for the better.
But first we need to picture the world that we're fighting for.
And we have to dream it up together.
Right now, every alarm in our house is going off simultaneously.
It's time to listen.
It's time to leap.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Tom Zimmerman: We'd like to take you on a fantastic journey to visit the creatures we call the Elders.
We call them the Elders because a half a billion years ago they tripled the amount of oxygen in the air, which led to an explosion of life, which led to all of us.
We call them the Elders, but you probably know them as plankton.
(Laughter) Now, Simone is a physicist, and I'm an inventor.
A couple of years ago, I was giving a talk about an invention I made -- it was a 3D microscope. And Simone was in the audience.
He realized that my microscope could solve a big problem he was having. Which was, how to measure the movement of plankton in 3D fast enough so he could mathematically model their sensing and behavior.
And I frankly needed an application for my microscope, so ...
(Laughter)
It was like peanut butter meets chocolate.
(Laughter)
So we started working together, studying these amazing creatures. And then we were alarmed to discover something.
And that's why we're here today.
And I just want to do something with you.
Now, please, just hold your breath for a second.
Yes, literally hold your breath.
This is the world without plankton.
You see, plankton generate two-thirds of our oxygen using the sun.
OK, now you can breathe, because they're still here. For now.
Simone Bianco: As many of you know, since 1950, the average surface temperature of the earth has increased by one degree Centigrade due to all the carbon dioxide we are pumping into the air.
Now, while this temperature increase may not seem like a big deal to us, it is to plankton.
Indirect measurements have shown that the global phytoplankton population may have decreased by as much as 40 percent between 1950 and 2010 because of climate change.
And you see, this is a problem also because it's starving the fish that eat them.
And about a billion people around the world depend on fish as their primary source of protein from animals.
So you see, this isn't just about breathing.
No plankton means no fish.
And that is a lot of food we will need to replace.
There's something else that is interesting. The bodies of plankton's ancestors actually make up a for lot of the carbon we burn today.
Which is kind of ironic, if you ask me. Because the plankton that are here today clean that carbon out of the air.
But you see, they don't really hold a grudge.
(Laughter)
The problem is they cannot keep up with the tremendous amount of carbon we are dumping into the air.
So what does all of this mean?
Well, it means that our big carbon footprint is crushing the very creatures that sustain us.
And yes, like Tom said, killing almost half of the creatures that allow us to breathe is a really big deal.
So you're probably asking yourself: Why aren't we doing something about it?
Our theory is that plankton are tiny, and it's really, really hard to care about something you cannot see.
You see, there's a quote I really like in "The Little Prince" that goes, "What is essential is invisible to the eye." We really believe that if more people could come face to ... cilia with plankton, there is a greater chance we could all rally together and save these creatures that are so important to life on our planet.
TZ: Exactly, Simone.
So to do this, we're going to bring you scuba diving with plankton.
But I just need to shrink you by a factor of 1000, to a scale where the diameter of a human hair is as big as my hand.
And I happen to have invented a machine to do just that.
SB: Anyone here remember "Fantastic Voyage" or "Innerspace?" Yeah, yeah. Martin Short is one of my all-time favorite actors.
And now this -- this is just like that.
TZ: Indeed, yes.
When I was a boy, I saw "Fantastic Voyage," and I really loved how I could travel through the bloodstream and see biology work on a cellular level.
I've always been inspired by science fiction.
As an inventor, I try and turn fantasy into reality.
And I once invented this glove which let me travel and help people like you explore the virtual world.
So now I've invented this machine to let us explore the microscopic world.
It's not virtual, it's real. Just really, really tiny.
It's based on the microscope that got Simone's attention.
So, here's how it works.
I have an image sensor like the kind in your cell phone, behind the lens.
And then I have a little tray of plankton water like you might find from a river or my fish tank, which I never change the water on.
(Laughter)
Because I love plankton.
(Laughter)
And underneath I have a light, an LED, which is going to cast shadows of the plankton on the image sensor.
And now this silver thing is an XY plotter, so I can move the image sensor to follow the plankton as they swim.
Now comes the fantasy part.
(Laughter)
I put a tilt sensor on this helmet so I can control the microscope with my head.
And now let's look at the video from this image sensor.
These are all plankton. This is in that little tray, and with my head, I can move the microscope.
So now we're ready to go scuba diving with plankton.
My head will be the navigator, and Simone will be our tour guide.
SB: Yes.
(Laughter) So welcome all to the wonderful world of life in a drop of water.
Actually, as you can see, with this instrument, we are not at all limited to a single drop.
Alright, let's find something.
The little creatures you see in the center of your screen, they are called rotifer. They are the garbage collectors of our waters.
They break down organic matter and allow it to be reclaimed by the environment.
Now, you know, nature is an amazing recycler.
Structures are continuously built, they are decomposed and recycled, and all of that is powered by solar energy. But just think. Think about what will happen if, you know, our garbage collectors didn't come anymore, if they disappeared. Something else? Let's look for something else.
Oh, look at that. You see the big ice-cream-cone-shaped things?
Those are called Stentor, those are amazing creatures.
You know, they are big, but they are a single cell.
You remember the rotifer we just met?
That's about half a millimeter, it's about 1,000 cells -- it's typically 15 for the brain, 15 for the stomach and you know, about the same for reproduction, which is kind of the right mix, if you ask me.
(Laughter)
But ... right?
TZ: I agree.
SB: But a Stentor is only a single cell. And it's able to sense and react to its environment.
You see, it will swim forward when it's happy; it will swim backward when it's trying to get away from something like, you know, a toxic chemical.
With our friends in the Center for Cellular Construction and the help of the National Science Foundation, we are using Stentor to sense the presence of contamination in food and water, which I think is really cool. Alright, last one.
They are the creatures that provide the majority of oxygen in the air. They convert solar light and carbon dioxide into the oxygen that is filling your lungs right now.
So you see, we all got algae breath.
TZ: (Exhales) SB: Yay! (Laughter)
You know, there's something interesting.
About a billion years ago, ancient plants got their photosynthesis capability by incorporating tiny, tiny plankton into their cells.
That's exactly like us putting solar panels on top of our roofs.
So you see, the microscopic world is even more amazing than science fiction.
TZ: Oh, indeed.
So now you've seen how vital plankton are to our lives and how much we need them.
If we kill the plankton, we will die of asphyxiation or starvation, take your pick.
Oh, yes, I know it's sad, yes.
(Laughter)
In the game of plankton, you win or you die.
(Laughter) Now, what amazes me is, we have known about global warming for over a century.
Ever since the Swedish scientist, Arrhenius, calculated the effect of burning fossil fuel on the earth's temperature.
We've known about this for a long time, but it's not too late if we act now.
Yes, yes, I know, I know, our world is based on fossil fuels, but we can adjust our society to run on renewable energy from the Sun to create a more sustainable and secure future.
That's good for the little creatures here, the plankton, and that good for us -- here's why.
The three greatest concerns of people all around the globe typically are jobs, violence and health.
A job means food and shelter.
Look at these creatures, they're swimming around, they're looking for a place to eat and reproduce.
If a single cell is programmed to do that, it's no surprise that 30 trillion cells have the same agenda. Violence. Dependence on fossil fuels makes a country vulnerable. Which leads to conflicts all around the oil resources.
Solar energy, on the other hand, is distributed around the whole globe, and no one can blockade the sun.
(Laughter)
And then, finally, health. Fossil fuels are like a global cigarette.
And in my opinion, coal is like an unfiltered type.
Now, just like smoking, the best time to quit is when?
Audience: Now.
TZ: Now! Not when you get lung cancer.
Now I know if you look around, some people may abandon facts and reason. Only until suffering --
(Laughter) Yes, they will abandon facts and reason.
But suffering will eventually and inevitably force change.
But let's instead use our neocortex, our new brain, to save the Elders, some of the oldest creatures on the earth. And let's apply science to harness the energy that has fueled the Elders for millions of years -- the sun.
Thank you.
(Applause)
As an elementary school teacher, my mom did everything she could to ensure I had good reading skills.
This usually consisted of weekend reading lessons at our kitchen table while my friends played outside.
My reading ability improved, but these forced reading lessons didn't exactly inspire a love of reading.
High school changed everything. In 10th grade, my regular English class read short stories and did spelling tests.
Out of sheer boredom, I asked to be switched into another class.
The next semester, I joined advanced English.
(Laughter)
We read two novels and wrote two book reports that semester.
The drastic difference and rigor between these two English classes angered me and spurred questions like, "Where did all these white people come from?"
(Laughter)
My high school was over 70 percent black and Latino, but this advanced English class had white students everywhere.
This personal encounter with institutionalized racism altered my relationship with reading forever.
I learned that I couldn't depend on a school, a teacher or curriculum to teach me what I needed to know.
And more out of like, rebellion, than being intellectual, I decided I would no longer allow other people to dictate when and what I read.
And without realizing it, I had stumbled upon a key to helping children read. Identity.
Instead of fixating on skills and moving students from one reading level to another, or forcing struggling readers to memorize lists of unfamiliar words, we should be asking ourselves this question: How can we inspire children to identify as readers?
DeSean, a brilliant first-grader I taught in the Bronx, he helped me understand how identity shapes learning.
One day during math, I walk up to DeSean, and I say, "DeSean, you're a great mathematician." He looks at me and responds, "I'm not a mathematician, I'm a math genius!"
(Laughter)
OK DeSean, right? Reading? Completely different story. "Mr. Irby, I can't read.
I'm never going to learn to read," he would say.
I taught DeSean to read, but there are countless black boys who remain trapped in illiteracy.
According to the US Department of Education, more than 85 percent of black male fourth graders are not proficient in reading. 85 percent! The more challenges to reading children face, the more culturally competent educators need to be.
Moonlighting as a stand-up comedian for the past eight years, I understand the importance of cultural competency, which I define as the ability to translate what you want someone else to know or be able to do into communication or experiences that they find relevant and engaging.
Before going on stage, I assess an audience.
Are they white, are they Latino?
Are they old, young, professional, conservative?
Then I curate and modify my jokes based on what I think would generate the most laughter.
While performing in a church, I could tell bar jokes.
But that might not result in laughter.
(Laughter)
As a society, we're creating reading experiences for children that are the equivalent of telling bar jokes in a church.
And then we wonder why so many children don't read.
Educator and philosopher Paulo Freire believed that teaching and learning should be two-way.
Students shouldn't be viewed as empty buckets to be filled with facts but as cocreators of knowledge.
Cookie-cutter curriculums and school policies that require students to sit statue-still or to work in complete silence -- these environments often exclude the individual learning needs, the interest and expertise of children. Especially black boys.
Many of the children's books promoted to black boys focus on serious topics, like slavery, civil rights and biographies.
Less than two percent of teachers in the United States are black males.
And a majority of black boys are raised by single mothers.
There are literally young black boys who have never seen a black man reading.
Or never had a black man encourage him to read.
What cultural factors, what social cues are present that would lead a young black boy to conclude that reading is even something he should do?
This is why I created Barbershop Books.
It's a literacy nonprofit that creates child-friendly reading spaces in barber shops.
The mission is simple: to help young black boys identify as readers.
Lots of black boys go to the barber shop once or twice a month.
Some see their barbers more than they see their fathers.
Barbershop Books connects reading to a male-centered space and involves black men and boys' early reading experiences.
This identity-based reading program uses a curated list of children's books recommended by black boys.
These are the books that they actually want to read.
Scholastic's 2016 Kids and Family Report found that the number one thing children look for when choosing a book is a book that will make them laugh.
So if we're serious about helping black boys and other children to read when it's not required, we need to incorporate relevant male reading models into early literacy.
In exchange, some of the children's books that adults love so much for funny, silly or even gross books, like "Gross Greg".
(Laughter)
"You call them boogers.
Greg calls them delicious little sugars. "
(Laughter)
That laugh, that positive reaction or gross reaction some of you just had,
(Laughter)
black boys deserve and desperately need more of that.
Dismantling the savage inequalities that plague American education requires us to create reading experiences that inspire all children to say three words: I'm a reader.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I grew up white, secular and middle class in 1950s America.
That meant watching fireworks on the Fourth of July, trick-or-treating on Halloween and putting presents under a tree at Christmas.
But by the time those traditions got to me, they were hollow, commercial enterprises, which just left me feeling empty.
So from a relatively young age, I found myself looking to fill an existential hole, to connect with something bigger than myself.
There hadn't been a bar mitzvah in my family in over a century, so I thought I'd take a shot at that --
(Laughter)
only to be devastated when my one encounter with the rabbi, a really tall, godlike figure with flowing white hair, consisted of him asking me for my middle name so we could fill out a form.
(Laughter) Yep, that was it.
So I got the fountain pen, but I didn't get the sense of belonging and confidence I was searching for.
Many years later, I couldn't bear the thought of my son turning 13 without some kind of rite of passage.
So I came up with the idea of a 13th birthday trip, and I offered to take Murphy anywhere in the world that had meaning for him.
A budding young naturalist who loved turtles, he immediately settled on the Galapagos.
And when my daughter, Katie, turned 13, she and I spent two weeks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, where Katie learned for the first time that she was powerful and brave.
Since then, my partner, Ashton, and lots of our friends and relatives have taken their kids on 13th birthday trips, with everyone finding it transformative for both the child and the parent.
I wasn't brought up saying grace.
But for the last 20 years, we've been holding hands before every meal.
It's a beautiful bit of shared silence that brings us all together in the moment.
Ashton tells everyone to "pass the squeeze," while she assures them it's not religious.
(Laughter)
So recently, when my family asked me if I could please do something with the more than 250 boxes of stuff that I've collected over a lifetime, my ritual-making impulse kicked in.
I started wondering if I could go further than simple death cleaning. "Death cleaning" is the Swedish term for clearing out your closets, your basement and your attic before you die, so your kids don't have to do it later.
(Laughter)
I pictured my children opening up box after box and wondering why I'd kept any of that stuff.
(Laughter)
And then I imagined them looking at a specific picture of me with a beautiful young woman, and asking, "Who on earth is that with Dad?"
(Laughter)
And that was the aha moment.
It wasn't the things I'd saved that were important; it was the stories that went with them that gave them meaning.
Could using the objects to tell the stories be the seed of a new ritual, a rite of passage -- not for a 13-year-old, but for someone much further down the road?
So I started experimenting. I got a few dozen things out of the boxes, I put them about in a room, and I invited people to come in and ask me about anything that they found interesting.
The results were terrific.
A good story became a launching pad for a much deeper discussion, in which my visitors made meaningful connections to their own lives.
Derrius [Quarles] asked me about a Leonard Peltier T-shirt that I'd worn a lot in the '80s, that, sadly, is still relevant today.
Our conversation moved quickly, from a large number of political prisoners in American jails, to Derrius wondering about the legacy of the Black Liberation Movement of the '60s, and how his life might be different if he'd come of age then, instead of 30-odd years later.
At the end of our conversation, Derrius asked me if he could have the T-shirt.
And giving it to him felt just about perfect.
As these conversations established common ground, especially across generations, I realized I was opening a space for people to talk about things that really mattered to them.
And I started seeing myself with a renewed sense of purpose -- not as the old guy on the way out, but as someone with a role to play going forward.
When I was growing up, life ended for most people in their 70s.
People are living far longer now, and for the first time in human history, it's common for four generations to be living side by side.
I'm 71, and with a bit of luck, I've got 20 or 30 more years ahead of me.
Giving away my stuff now and sharing it with friends, family, and I hope strangers, too, seems like the perfect way to enter this next stage of my life.
Turns out to be just what I was looking for: a ritual that's less about dying and more about opening the door to whatever comes next.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Onward!
The history of civilization, in some ways, is a history of maps: How have we come to understand the world around us?
One of the most famous maps works because it really isn't a map at all.
[Small thing. Big idea.]
The London Underground came together in 1908, when eight different independent railways merged to create a single system.
They needed a map to represent that system so people would know where to ride.
The map they made is complicated.
You can see rivers, bodies of water, trees and parks -- the stations were all crammed together at the center of the map, and out in the periphery, there were some that couldn't even fit on the map.
So the map was geographically accurate, but maybe not so useful.
Enter Harry Beck. Harry Beck was a 29-year-old engineering draftsman who had been working on and off for the London Underground.
And he had a key insight, and that was that people riding underground in trains don't really care what's happening aboveground.
They just want to get from station to station -- "Where do I get on? Where do I get off?" It's the system that's important, not the geography.
He's taken this complicated mess of spaghetti, and he's simplified it.
The lines only go in three directions: they're horizontal, they're vertical, or they're 45 degrees.
Likewise, he spaced the stations equally, he's made every station color correspond to the color of the line, and he's fixed it all so that it's not really a map anymore.
What it is is a diagram, just like circuitry, except the circuitry here isn't wires conducting electrons, it's tubes containing trains conducting people from place to place.
In 1933, the Underground decided, at last, to give Harry Beck's map a try.
The Underground did a test run of a thousand of these maps, pocket-size.
They were gone in one hour.
They realized they were onto something, they printed 750,000 more, and this is the map that you see today.
Beck's design really became the template for the way we think of metro maps today.
Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, São Paulo, Sydney, Washington, D.C. -- all of them convert complex geography into crisp geometry.
All of them use different colors to distinguish between lines, all of them use simple symbols to distinguish between types of stations.
They all are part of a universal language, seemingly.
I bet Harry Beck wouldn't have known what a user interface was, but that's really what he designed and he really took that challenge and broke it down to three principles that I think can be applied in nearly any design problem.
First one is focus.
Focus on who you're doing this for.
The second principle is simplicity.
What's the shortest way to deliver that need?
Finally, the last thing is: Thinking in a cross-disciplinary way.
Who would've thought that an electrical engineer would be the person to hold the key to unlock what was then one of the most complicated systems in the world -- all started by one guy with a pencil and an idea.
The hoodie is an amazing object.
It's one of those timeless objects that we hardly think of, because they work so well that they're part of our lives.
We call them "humble masterpieces."
[Small thing.] [Big idea.]
[Paola Antonelli on the Hoodie]
The hoodie has been -- even if it was not called so -- it's been an icon throughout history for good and for bad reasons.
The earliest ones that we can trace are from ancient Greece and ancient Rome.
The Middle Ages, you see a lot of monks that were wearing garments that were cape-like, with hoods attached, so therefore, "hoodies." Ladies in the 17th century would wear hoodies to kind of hide themselves when they were going to meet their lovers.
And then, of course, there's the legend, there's fantasy.
There's the image of the hoodie connected to the grim reaper.
There's the image of the hoodie connected to the executioner.
So there's the dark side of the hoodie.
The modern incarnation of the hoodie -- a garment that's made usually of cotton jersey, that has a hood attached with a drawstring; sometimes it has a marsupial pocket -- was introduced in the 1930s by Knickerbocker Knitting Company. Now it's called Champion. It was meant to keep athletes warm.
Of course, though, it was such a functional, comfortable garment that it was very rapidly adopted by workmen everywhere.
And then, around the 1980s, it also gets adopted by hip-hop and B-boys, skateboarders, and it takes on this kind of youth street culture.
It was, at the same time, super-comfortable, perfect for the streets and also had that added value of anonymity when you needed it.
And then we have Mark Zuckerberg, who defies convention of respectable attire for businesspeople.
But interestingly, it's also a way to show how power has changed.
If you're wearing a two-piece suit, you might be the bodyguard.
The real powerful person is wearing a hoodie with a T-shirt and jeans.
It's easy to think of the physical aspects of the hoodie.
You can immediately think of wearing the hood up, and you feel this warmth and this protection, but at the same time, you can also feel the psychological aspects of it.
I mean, think of donning a hoodie, all of a sudden, you feel more protected, you feel that you are in your own shell.
We know very well what the hoodie has come to signify in the past few years in the United States.
When Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African-American kid, was shot by a neighborhood vigilante, and Million Hoodie Marches happened all over the United States, in which people wore hoodies with the hood up and marched in the streets against this kind of prejudice.
It doesn't happen that often for a garment to have so much symbolism and history and that encompasses so many different universes as the hoodie.
So, like all garments, especially all truly utilitarian garments, it is very basic in its design.
But at the same time, it has a whole universe of possibilities attached.
The sound is a really big part, I think, of the experience of using a pencil, and it has this really audible scratchiness.
(Scratching)
[Small thing. Big idea.]
The pencil is a very simple object.
It's made of wood with some layers of paint an eraser and a core, which is made out of graphite, clay and water.
Yeah, it took hundreds of people over centuries to come to this design.
And it's that long history of collaboration that, to me, makes it a very perfect object.
The story of the pencil starts with graphite.
People started finding really useful applications for this new substance.
They cut it into small sticks and wrapped it in string or sheepskin or paper and sold it on the streets of London to be used for writing or for drawing or, a lot of times, by farmers and shepherds, who used it to mark their animals.
Over in France, Nicolas-Jacques Conté figured out a method of grinding the graphite, mixing it with powdered clay and water to make a paste.
From there, this paste was filled into a mold and fired in a kiln, and the result was a really strong graphite core that wasn't breakable, that was smooth, usable -- it was so much better than anything else that existed at the time, and to this day, that's the method that's still used in making pencils.
Meanwhile, over in America, in Concord, Massachusetts, it was Henry David Thoreau who came up with the grading scale for different hardnesses of pencil.
It was graded one through four, number two being the ideal hardness for general use.
The softer the pencil, the more graphite it had in it, and the darker and smoother the line will be.
The firmer the pencil, the more clay it had in it and the lighter and finer it will be.
Originally, when pencils were handmade, they were made round.
There was no easy way to make them, and it was the Americans who really mechanized the craft.
A lot of people credit Joseph Dixon for being one of the first people to start developing actual machines to do things like cut wood slats, cut grooves into the wood, apply glue to them ... And they figured out it was easier and less wasteful to do a hexagonal pencil, and so that became the standard.
Since the early days of pencils, people have loved that they can be erased.
Originally, it was bread crumbs that were used to scratch away pencil marks and later, rubber and pumice.
The attached eraser happened in 1858, when American stationer Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil with an attached eraser, which really changed the pencil game.
The world's first yellow pencil was the KOH-I-NOOR 1500.
KOH-I-NOOR did this crazy thing where they painted this pencil with 14 coats of yellow paint and dipped the end in 14-carat gold.
There is a pencil for everyone, and every pencil has a story.
The Blackwing 602 is famous for being used by a lot of writers, especially John Steinbeck and Vladimir Nabokov.
And then, you have the Dixon pencil company.
They're responsible for the Dixon Ticonderoga.
It's an icon, it's what people think of when they think of a pencil and what they think of when they think of school.
And the pencil's really a thing that, I think, the average user has never thought twice about, how it's made or why it's made the way it is, because it's just always been that way.
In my opinion, there's nothing that can be done to make the pencil better than it is. It's perfect.
If you do it right, it should sound like: TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat. If you do it wrong, it sounds like: Tick-TAT, tick-TAT, tick-TAT.
[Small thing. Big idea.]
The jump rope is such a simple object. It can be made out of rope, a clothesline, twine.
It has, like, a twirl on it. (Laughs) I'm not sure how to describe that.
What's important is that it has a certain weight, and that they have that kind of whip sound.
It's not clear what the origin of the jump rope is.
There's some evidence that it began in ancient Egypt, Phoenicia, and then it most likely traveled to North America with Dutch settlers.
The rope became a big thing when women's clothes became more fitted and the pantaloon came into being.
And so, girls were able to jump rope because their skirts wouldn't catch the ropes.
Governesses used it to train their wards to jump rope.
Even formerly enslaved African children in the antebellum South jumped rope, too.
In the 1950s, in Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, you could see on the sidewalk, lots of girls playing with ropes.
Sometimes they would take two ropes and turn them as a single rope together, but you could separate them and turn them in like an eggbeater on each other.
The skipping rope was like a steady timeline -- tick, tick, tick, tick -- upon which you can add rhymes and rhythms and chants.
Those ropes created a space where we were able to contribute to something that was far greater than the neighborhood.
Double Dutch jump rope remains a powerful symbol of culture and identity for black women.
Back from the 1950s to the 1970s, girls weren't supposed to play sports.
Boys played baseball, basketball and football, and girls weren't allowed.
A lot has changed, but in that era, girls would rule the playground.
They'd make sure that boys weren't a part of that.
It's their space, it's a girl-power space.
It's where they get to shine.
But I also think it's for boys, because boys overheard those, which is why, I think, so many hip-hop artists sampled from things that they heard in black girls' game songs.
Why "Country Grammar" by Nelly became a Grammy Award-winning single was because people already knew "We're going down down baby your street in a Range Rover ... " That's the beginning of "Down down, baby, down down the roller coaster, sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go." All people who grew up in any black urban community would know that music.
And so, it was a ready-made hit.
The Double Dutch rope playing helped maintain these songs and helped maintain the chants and the gestures that go along with it, which is very natural to what I call "kinetic orality" -- word of mouth and word of body.
It's the thing that gets passed down over generations.
In some ways, the rope is the thing that helps carry it.
You need some object to carry memory through.
So, a jump rope, you can use it for all different kinds of things. It crosses cultures. And I think it lasted because people need to move.
And I think sometimes the simplest objects can make the most creative uses.
I remember thinking to myself, "This is going to change everything about how we communicate."
[Small thing.] [Big idea.]
[Margaret Gould Stewart on the Hyperlink]
A hyperlink is an interface element, and what I mean by that is, when you're using software on your phone or your computer, there's a lot of code behind the interface that's giving all the instructions for the computer on how to manage it, but that interface is the thing that humans interact with: when we press on this, then something happens.
When they first came around, they were pretty simple and not particularly glamorous.
Designers today have a huge range of options.
The hyperlink uses what's called a markup language -- HTML.
There's a little string of code.
And then you put the address of where you want to send the person.
It's actually remarkably easy to learn how to do.
And so, the whole range of references to information elsewhere on the internet is the domain of the hyperlink.
Back when I was in school -- this is before people had wide access to the internet -- if I was going to do a research paper, I would have to physically walk to the library, and if they had the book that you needed, great.
You sometimes had to send out for it, so the process could take weeks.
And it's kind of crazy to think about that now, because, like all great innovations, it's not long after we get access to something that we start to take it for granted.
Back in 1945, there was this guy, Vannevar Bush.
He was working for the US government, and one of the ideas that he put forth was, "Wow, humans are creating so much information, and we can't keep track of all the books that we've read or the connections between important ideas." And he had this idea called the "memex," where you could put together a personal library of all of the books and articles that you have access to.
And that idea of connecting sources captured people's imaginations.
Later, in the 1960s, Ted Nelson launches Project Xanadu, and he said, "Well, what if it wasn't just limited to the things that I have?
What if I could connect ideas across a larger body of work?" In 1982, researchers at the University of Maryland developed a system they called HyperTIES.
They were the first to use text itself as a link marker.
They figured out that this blue link on a gray background was going to work really well in terms of contrast, and people would be able to see it.
Apple invented HyperCard in 1987.
You had these stacks of cards, and you could create links in between the cards.
HyperCard actually created the ability to jump around in a story.
These kinds of notions of nonlinear storytelling got a huge boost when the hyperlink came along, because it gave people the opportunity to influence the narrative.
These ideas and inventions, among others, inspired Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.
The hyperlink almost feels like a LEGO block, this very basic building block to a very complex web of connections that exists all around the world.
Because of the way that hyperlinks were first constructed, they were intended to be not only used by many people, but created by many people.
To me, it's one of the most democratic designs ever created.
[It's time to start talking about engineering our climate]
What if there was a way to build a thermostat that allowed you to turn down the temperature of the earth anytime you wanted?
Now, you would think if somebody had a plausible idea about how to do that, everybody would be very excited about it, and there would be lots of research on how to do it.
But in fact, a lot of people do understand how to do that.
But there's not much support for research in this area.
And I think part of it is because there are some real misunderstandings about it.
So I'm not going to try to convince you today that this is a good idea.
But I am going to try to get your curiosity going about it and clear up some of the misunderstandings.
So, the basic idea of solar geoengineering is that we can cool things down just by reflecting a little bit more sunlight back into space.
And ideas about how to do this have been around literally for decades.
Clouds are a great way to do that, these low-lying clouds.
Everybody knows it's cooler under a cloud.
I like this cloud because it has exactly the same water content as the transparent air around it.
And it just shows that even a little bit of a change in the flow of the air can cause a cloud to form.
We make artificial clouds all the time. These are contrails, which are artificial water clouds that are made by the passing of a jet engine.
And so, we're already changing the clouds on earth. By accident. Or, if you like to believe it, by supersecret government conspiracy.
(Laughter)
But we are already doing this quite a lot.
This is a NASA picture of shipping lanes.
Passing ships actually cause clouds to form, and this is a big enough effect that it actually helps reduce global warming already by about a degree.
So we already are doing solar engineering.
There's lots of ideas about how to do this.
People have looked at everything, from building giant parasols out into space to fizzing bubble waters in the ocean.
And some of these are actually very plausible ideas.
One that was published recently by David Keith at Harvard is to take chalk and put dust up into the stratosphere, where it reflects off sunlight.
And that's a really neat idea, because chalk is one of the most common minerals on earth, and it's very safe -- it's so safe, we put it into baby food.
And basically, if you throw chalk up into the stratosphere, it comes down in a couple of years all by itself, dissolved in rainwater.
Now, before you start worrying about all this chalk in your rainwater, let me explain to you how little of it it actually takes.
And that turns out to be very easy to calculate.
This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation I made.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I assure you, people have done much more careful calculations, and it comes out with the same answer, which is that you have to put chalk up at the rate of about 10 teragrams a year to undo the effects of the CO2 that we've already done -- just in terms of temperature, not all the effects, but the temperature.
So what does that look like?
I can't visualize 10 teragrams per year.
So I asked the Cambridge Fire Department and Taylor Milsal to lend me a hand.
This is a hose pumping water at 10 teragrams a year.
And that is how much you would have to pump into the stratosphere to cool the earth back down to pre-industrial levels.
And it's amazingly little; it's like one hose for the entire earth.
Now of course, you wouldn't really use a hose, you'd fly it up in airplanes or something like that.
But it's so little, it would be like putting a handful of chalk into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain.
It's almost nothing.
So why don't people like this idea?
Why isn't it taken more seriously?
And there are some very good reasons for that.
A lot of people really don't think we should be talking about this at all.
And, in fact, I have some very good friends in the audience who I respect a lot, who really don't think I should be talking about this.
And the reason is that they're concerned that if people imagine there's some easy way out, that we won't give up our addiction to fossil fuels.
And I do worry about that.
I think it's actually a serious problem.
But there's also, I think, a deeper problem, which is: nobody likes the idea of messing with the entire earth -- I certainly don't. I love this planet, I really do. And I don't want to mess with it.
But we're already changing our atmosphere, we're already messing with it.
And so I think it makes sense for us to look for ways to mitigate that impact.
And we need to do research to do that.
We need to understand the science behind that.
I've noticed that there's a theme that's kind of developed at TED, which is kind of, "fear versus hope," or "creativity versus caution." And of course, we need both of those.
So there aren't any silver bullets.
This is certainly not a silver bullet.
But we need science to tell us what our options are; that informs both our creativity and our caution.
So I am an optimist about our future selves, but I'm not an optimist because I think our problems are small.
I'm an optimist because I think our capacity to deal with our problems is much greater than we imagine.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
This talk sparked a lot of controversy at TED2017, and we encourage you to look at discussions online to see other points of view.
"Will the blight end the chestnut?
The farmers rather guess not.
It keeps smouldering at the roots And sending up new shoots Till another parasite Shall come to end the blight."
At the beginning of the 20th century, the eastern American chestnut population, counting nearly four billion trees, was completely decimated by a fungal infection.
Fungi are the most destructive pathogens of plants, including crops of major economic importance.
Can you imagine that today, crop losses associated with fungal infection are estimated at billions of dollars per year, worldwide?
That represents enough food calories to feed half a billion people.
And this leads to severe repercussions, including episodes of famine in developing countries, large reduction of income for farmers and distributors, high prices for consumers and risk of exposure to mycotoxin, poison produced by fungi.
The problems that we face is that the current method used to prevent and treat those dreadful diseases, such as genetic control, exploiting natural sources of resistance, crop rotation or seed treatment, among others, are still limited or ephemeral.
They have to be constantly renewed.
Therefore, we urgently need to develop more efficient strategies and for this, research is required to identify biological mechanisms that can be targeted by novel antifungal treatments.
One feature of fungi is that they cannot move and only grow by extension to form a sophisticated network, the mycelium.
In 1884, Anton de Bary, the father of plant pathology, was the first to presume that fungi are guided by signals sent out from the host plant, meaning a plant upon which it can lodge and subsist, so signals act as a lighthouse for fungi to locate, grow toward, reach and finally invade and colonize a plant.
He knew that the identification of such signals would unlock a great knowledge that then serves to elaborate strategy to block the interaction between the fungus and the plant.
However, the lack of an appropriate method at that moment prevented him from identifying this mechanism at the molecular level.
Using purification and mutational genomic approaches, as well as a technique allowing the measurement of directed hyphal growth, today I'm glad to tell you that after 130 years, my former team and I could finally identify such plant signals by studying the interaction between a pathogenic fungus called Fusarium oxysporum and one of its host plants, the tomato plant.
As well, we could characterize the fungal receptor receiving those signals and part of the underlying reaction occurring within the fungus and leading to its direct growth toward the plant.
(Applause)
Thank you.
The understanding of such molecular processes offers a panel of potential molecules that can be used to create novel antifungal treatments.
And those treatments would disrupt the interaction between the fungus and the plant either by blocking the plant signal or the fungal reception system which receives those signals.
Fungal infections have devastated agriculture crops.
Moreover, we are now in an era where the demand of crop production is increasing significantly. And this is due to population growth, economic development, climate change and demand for bio fuels.
Our understanding of the molecular mechanism of interaction between a fungus and its host plant, such as the tomato plant, potentially represents a major step towards developing more efficient strategy to combat plant fungal diseases and therefore solving of problems that affect people's lives, food security and economic growth.
Thank you.
(Applause)
